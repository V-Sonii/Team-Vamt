PRONOUNCED ON : 17.03.2022.                      JUDGMENT (PER : N.R. BORKAR,J.)1] This appeal takes an exception to the judgment and order dated 20.10.2011 passed by theAdditional Sessions Judge, Pune in Sessions Case No.925 of 2009.

Both the sentences are directed to run concurrently. The trial court has however, acquitted theaccused No.3 of all the ofences.3] We have heard the learned appointed counsel for the appellants and the learned APP for therespondent/State.4] The deceased Bajirao Shankar Deokar and his wife Sunanda Deokar were retired primaryTeachers and on the date of incident which took place in the intervening night of 20.06.2009 and21.06.2009 were residing at Vadgaon Anand, Dist. Pune.5] According to the prosecution, on the date of incident the appellants/accused entered into thehouse of deceased, with intent to commit robbery and while committing the robbery, committed themurders of the deceased.6] According to PW-1 Dr. Sanjay B. Deokar, the deceased were his parents. At the relevant time, hewas residing at village Ale Phata and his parents were residing at village Dinesh Sherla 2/10j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt Vadgaon Anand. He daily used to go to his parents' house in the morning andevening.7] According to PW-1, on 20.6.2009, he had gone to his parents' house at about 7.30 p.m. On thatday, during chit- chatting his father disclosed to him that accused No.1 with two others had been totheir house and they were making inquiry about their family. His father further disclosed to himthat since last few days, accused No.1 started parking his vehicle near their house. His fatherexpressed that the behaviour of accused No.1 is suspicious. According to PW-1, he stayed at thehouse of his parents for 10-15 minutes and then came back to his village.8] According to PW-1, on 21.6.2009, while he was at his ofce, he received phone call of PW-4 NileshWalunj, who used to deliver newspaper at the house of his parents. He asked him to reach to hisparents' house as lights were on, there was loud sound of T.V. and main gate was locked. Accordingto PW-1, he along with his assistant PW-19 Sandip Ghangale reached to his parents' house. PW-19went inside the house by climbing the main gate. He saw that the backdoor of the house was open.He went inside and saw that parents of PW- 1 were lying in dead condition. He came out andintimated to PW-1.9] According to PW-1, he then went inside and saw that his father was lying in kitchen. He examinedhim and found him Dinesh Sherla 3/10 j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt to be dead. Then he went to prayerroom. His mother was lying there and she was also dead. The cupboard was open and the articleswere lying scattered.10] According to PW-1, his mother used to wear gold earrings, one small gold Mangalsutra, one longgold Mangalsutra, four gold bangles and two gold rings. According to PW-1 the said ornaments werenot there on the person of his mother.Chetan Ramdas Dumre And Anr vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8653165/211] PW-1 in his cross-examination has admitted that accused No.1 was not known to him prior to theincident. At the time of lodging of report, he was not aware of the address of accused No.1 nor hegave the address of accused No.1 to the police. He then volunteered that he stated name of thevillage of accused No.1. PW-1 has then stated that he however, cannot assign any reason as to howcomplete address of accused No.1 came to be mentioned in his report.12] It is apparent from the evidence of PW-1 that accused No.1 was not known to him prior to theincident. It further appears that, the father of PW-1 for the frst time disclosed about accused No.1 toPW-1 only on 20.06.2009, i.e., on the day of incident. Thus, there was no reason for PW-1 to knowthe complete address of accused No.1. However, in the frst information report lodged by PW-1, hehas mentioned complete address of the accused No.1. The only inference which can be drawn fromthis fact is that in frst information Dinesh Sherla 4/10 j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt report, the name ofaccused No.1 came to be inserted subsequently. This creates doubt about the entire prosecutioncase.13] According to the prosecution, PW-8 Sandip Divekar, PW- 9 Vivek Shingte and PW-10Dnyaneshwar Walunj saw the accused No.1 and two more persons standing in front of the house ofdeceased in intervening night of 20.06.2009 and 21.06.2009. The trial court has disbelieved thesewitnesses. The trial court in its judgment has recorded the following fndings in respect of PW-8,PW-9 and PW-10:"100] On going through the evidence of Sandip Divekar (PW 8), Vivek Shingte (PW9) and Dnyaneshwar Walunj (OW 10), I am of the opinion that, their evidence is notworth believing to hold that they had seen the accused lingering around the house ofdeceased, just before the incident. Their evidence is not cogent and reliable as well asclinching to believe to be true. Hence, prosecution has failed to establish that accusedwere lingering around the house of deceased to get the opportunity to commit theofence."14] We have perused the evidence of PW-8, PW-9 and PW-10. According to PW-8, on 17.06.2009 at about 10.00 p.m. he had seen the accused standing nearthe house of deceased. According to him, he had asked the accused as to whether they had come tocommit theft and they got frightened. According to him, the accused told him they were going toDhaba and their bike got slipped. According to PW-8, the accused then started their bike and wentaway from there. In cross-examination, PW-8 has admitted that he never saw the Dinesh Sherla5/10 j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt accused prior to the day on which he saw them. He has further admittedthat after 17.06.2009 for the frst time, he is seeing the accused today in the court. Inspite of the factthat accused were unknown to PW-8, no identifcation parade was conducted.15] The evidence of PW-9 and PW-10 is similar to the evidence of PW-8. However, according tothem, they had seen the accused on 20.06.2009. According to PW-9, he had seen the accusedstanding near the house of deceased at about 8.00 p.m., whereas according to PW-10, he had seenthem there at about 6.30 p.m.. It is difcult to believe that the accused would come at 6.30 or 8.00Chetan Ramdas Dumre And Anr vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8653165/3p.m. with intent to commit robbery in the house of deceased and would stand near the house of thedeceased so that they can be sighted by other people. The trial court has disbelieved PW-8, PW-9and PW-10 and no submission is made on behalf of the prosecution that they have been wronglydisbelieved.16] The trial court has, however, convicted the accused Nos.1 and 2 on the basis of alleged recoveryof ornaments at their instance.17] According to PW-3 Yogendra Deokar, on 22.6.2009 he was called by the police in the policestation, Narayangaon. According to him, in his presence accused No.1 disclosed to the police that heis ready to show the shop where he sold the stolen necklace. According to PW-3, accused No.1 tookthem Dinesh Sherla 6/10 j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt to jewellery shop at Narayangaon, Bazarpeth.According to him, the jeweller handed over necklace to the police.18] In the cross-examination, PW-3 has admitted that he and the complainant belong to same caste.He has admitted that he cannot tell the names of police personnel who were present in the vehicle.19] At this stage, it would be appropriate to refer to the evidence of jeweller, PW-2 Ramesh Gujar.According to PW-2, he runs jewellery shop at Narayangaon under the name and style "DevnarayanJewellers". On 21.6.2009, he opened his shop at 9.00 a.m.. At about 11.00 a.m., two persons came tohis shop on motorcyle. They asked him to melt Mangalsutra. He asked them whether they havereceipt. They told him that they have not brought receipt. One of them told that Mangalsutrabelongs to his wife. He further told PW-2 that his sister is serious and therefore, they need moneyurgently and he will produce the receipt on the next day.20] According to PW-2, the said persons stated to him that he wants to purchase small Mangalsutraon melting big Mangalsutra. He told them that he will not accept Mangalsutra unless the receipt isbrought. Thereupon, they started weeping. He then checked Mangalstura. It was of gold. He brokethe black beads and then weighed the Mangalstura. It was found to be 37.500 grams. He thenshowed them small Mangalstura which was costing about Rs.16,500/-. He sold a Dinesh Sherla 7/10j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt small Mangalstura and paid cash of Rs. 21, 250/-. He prepared the receiptand at that time the said person disclosed his name of Chetan Dumbre, resident of Otur.21] According to PW-2, on 22.6.2009, accused Nos.1 and 2 were brought to his shop by police andhe handed over Mangalsutra which was purchased by him from accused Nos.1 and 2.22] In the cross-examination, PW-2 has admitted that he maintains daily account of his business,however, as on today, the account on the day on which the accused came to his shop is not available.He did not obtain the signature of the person who sold the ornament on receipt at Exhibit-65. Hehas admitted that till today, he does not know the name of person who was accompanying accusedNo.1. He has admitted that in the statement to the police, he has not stated that the accused wereweeping.Chetan Ramdas Dumre And Anr vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8653165/423] There are material omissions in the evidence of PW-2 including the fact that the accused No.1had told him that he would bring the purchase receipt on next day. It is unlikely that PW-2 wouldnot obtain the signature of a person who had come to sell the ornaments on sale-purchase receipts.Considering the overall facts and circumstances, in our view, it would not be safe to rely upon theevidence of PW-2.Dinesh Sherla                                                         8/10                                                j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt24]     Apart from above, according to PW-3, the panch witness,PW-2 had handed over neckalce to the police. PW-3 has specifcally stated that he is not related tothe complainant, however, PW-22 Shrikrishna Kokate, the Investigating Ofcer, has admitted thatPW-3 is a closed relative of the complainant (PW-1). Considering the overall facts, it would not besafe to connect the accused with alleged crime on the basis of alleged recovery of Mangalsutra.25] According to PW-1, on 28.8.2009, he and his brother, his wife Vaishali and sister Manjushawere called at the police station and they were asked to identify the ornaments in presence of panchwitnesses and Tahsildhar. According to PW- 1, he identifed the Mangalsutra of his mother amongstother Mangalsutra which were there. PW-1 has admitted that the identifcation was held only forMangalsutra.26] As the recovery of Mangalsutra itself is doubtful and therefore, it's identifcation by PW-1 is of noconsequence. It appears that except Mangalsutra, no other ornaments were got identifed.27] Considering the overall facts and circumstances, the trial court was not justifed in arriving at theconclusion that the prosecution has proved it's case beyond reasonable doubt. In the result, thefollowing order is passed.Dinesh Sherla                                                           9/10                                                   j-cri-apeal-352-12.odt                                 ORDER       a]       Criminal Appeal is allowed.       b]       The   impugned     judgment   and      order        dated20.10.2011 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Pune in Sessions Case No.925 of 2009convicting appellant No.1 Chetan Ramdas Dumbre and appellant No.2 Nilesh Dnyaneshwar Vitekarfor the ofences punishable under sections 302 and 394 read with 34 of the IPC is set aside and theyare acquitted of the said ofences.Chetan Ramdas Dumre And Anr vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8653165/5c] The appellants are in jail, they be released forthwith unless their custody is required in connectionwith any other crime.d] The appellants shall execute P.R.
