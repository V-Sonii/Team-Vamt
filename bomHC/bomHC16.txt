During the pendency of the said reference before the Reference Court, the Central Governmenthaving regard to the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution andto promote public welfare to bring about an equitable and indiscriminate payment of compensationbetween persons who are similarly situated, under the same land acquisition notification and inrecognizing the sacrifice they make in the larger public interest, introduced a bill dated 30September 1982 before the Parliament to amend the Act, by inter alia incorporating Section 28A.Such amendment was intended considering the stark 11 wp6184-09grp realities, that many poor andinarticulate owners of acquired land were not usually taking advantage of making a referenceprovided by Section 18 of the Act, to seek an enhanced/adequate compensation for their acquiredlands. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill described the intention for the proposedlegislation in the following words:-"Considering that the right of reference to the civil court under Section 18 of the Actis not usually taken advantage by poor and inarticulate and is usually exercised onlyby the comparatively affluent land owners and that this causes considerableinequality in the payment of compensation for the same or similar quality of land todifferent interested persons, it was proposed to provide an opportunity to allaggrieved parties whose land is covered under the same Notification to seekre-determination of compensation, once any one of them has obtained orders ofpayment of higher compensation from the reference court under Section 18 of theAct."5. The 1982 Bill was followed by the enactment of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act,1984 (forshort the "1984 Amendment Act"), which was brought into effect on 24 September 1984. Although,the relevant amendment for the purpose of the present proceedings is the incorporation of Section28A by Section 19 of the 1984 Amendment Act, providing for 're-determination of the amount ofcompensation on the basis of the award of the Court', it would also be necessary to note some otherprovisions of the 1984 Amendment Act namely Section 15, Section 18 and Section 30 which wouldhave some bearing on the issue. These provisions read thus:"15. Amendment of Section 23.-In Section 23 of the principal Act,-(a) after sub-section (1), the following sub-section shall be 12 wp6184-09grp inserted, namely:-"(1-A) In addition to the market value of the land, as above provided, the Court shall in every caseaward an amount calculated at the rate of twelve per centum per annum on such market value forthe period commencing on and from the date of the publication of the notification under Section 4,sub-section (1), in respect of such land to the date of the award of the Collector or the date of takingpossession of the land, whichever is earlier.Explanation.-In computing the period referred to in this sub- section, any period or periods duringwhich the proceedings for the acquisition of the land were held up on account of any stay orinjunction by the order of any court shall be excluded.";Sambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/9(b) in sub-section (2), for the words "fifteen per centum", the words "thirty per centum" shall besubstituted. ..... ....18.

(emphasisadded)6. By virtue of the "Transitional provisions" of the 1984 Amending Act, the provisions of sub-Section(2) of Section 23 and Section 28 of the Principal Act, as amended by clause (b) of Section 15 andSection 18 of the Amending Act, were deemed applicable, also in relation to, any award made by theCollector or Court or to any order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal against anysuch award under the provisions of the principal Act after 30 April 1982, being the date ofintroduction of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill,1982, before the Parliament and before thecommencement of the 1984 Amendment Act. These transitional provisions, according to thepetitioners, become relevant for the reason that as on 30 April 1982 the land acquisition 14wp6184-09grp reference was pending, before the Court of learned District Judge, Pune, whicheventually came to be decided on 15 February 1984.7. The next provision and the plinth of the present proceedings, is Section 28-A which came to beinserted by Section 19 of the 1984 Amendment Act, providing for 're-determination of the amount ofcompensation on the basis of the award of the Court. ' Section 28A was brought into effect from 24September 1984. It reads thus:-"28-A. Re-determination of the amount of compensation on the basis of the award ofthe Court. Š (1) Where in an award under this Part, the Court allows to the applicantany amount of compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector undersection 11, the persons interested in all the other land covered by the samenotification under section 4, sub-section (1) and who are also aggrieved by the awardof the Collector may, notwithstanding that they had not made an application to theCollector under section 18, by written application to the Collector within threemonths from the date of the award of the Court require that the amount ofcompensation payable to them may be re-determined on the basis of the amount ofcompensation awarded by the Court:Provided that in computing the period of three months within which an applicationto the Collector shall be made under this sub-section, the day on which the award waspronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the award shall beexcluded.(2) The Collector shall, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1), conduct aninquiry after giving notice to all the persons interested and giving them a reasonableopportunity of being heard, and make an award determining the amount ofcompensation payable to the applicants. (3) Any person who has not accepted theaward under sub-section (2) may, by written application to the Collector, require thatthe matter be referred by the Collector for the determination of the Court and theprovisions of sections 18 to 28 shall, so far as may be, apply to such reference as theySambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/11apply to a reference under section 18.]"(emphasis supplied)8. As seen from the Statement of Object and Reasons of the Amending Act thelegislative intent behind Section 28A was primarily to 15 wp6184-09grp provide anopportunity to all aggrieved parties whose lands were covered under the samenotification to seek re-determination of compensation, once any one of the interestedparties had obtained orders for payment of higher compensation from the ReferenceCourt under Section 18 of the Act. Such amendment was intended for the reason thatthe right to avail of a reference to the Civil Court under Section 18 of the Act, was notusually taken advantage by inarticulate and poor people and/or was seen to beexercised only by comparatively affluent land owners, which had resulted into anapparent inequality in the payment of compensation, to persons falling under thesame notification for the same or similar quality of land. The object of suchamendment was to bring parity in payment of compensation to persons who aresimilarly situated, however, who otherwise had formed two classes, one who hadapproached the Reference Court and the others who were inherently deprived ofapproaching the Reference Court for want of economic resources. The legislature inits wisdom considered it appropriate to provide an advantage of payment of a highercompensation if so determined by the Reference Court to those who although wereaggrieved by the award of the SLAO, however, due to economic constraints could notapproach the Reference Court, in terms of what was envisaged in Section 28A.16 wp6184-09grp9. Having noted the intervening legislative developments which had taken place,when the Reference proceedings before the Court of learned District Judge, at thebehest of some persons were pending, the further factual developments that tookplace are required to be noted:The Reference applicants being aggrieved by the award/judgment dated 15 February1984 (supra) rendered by the learned District Judge on the land acquisitionreference, preferred Miscellaneous Application No.369 of 1986 praying for reviewand modification of such award/judgment. The learned District Judge by an orderdated 5 September 1994 disposed of the review application by modifying the originalaward/judgment dated 5 February 1984, enhancing the compensation as originallyawarded, by granting benefit of enhanced solatium as per the amended provisionsinserted by the 1984 Amendment Act. The relevant extract of the modified award ofthe learned District Judge is required to be noted, which reads thus:-"5. I have verified that, the Collector has passed an award on 30-11-74, but the courthas passed an award on 15-2-84 i.e. after 30-4-82. I have also seen original judgment(Ex.29) in L.R.No.8/79 which does show that, the applicant has been awardedSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/12enhanced compensation to the tune of Rs.89,934.07 ps.

After the review judgment was pronounced by the Reference Court on 5 September 1994, thepetitioners applied for its certified copy on 28 October 1994. The certified copy was kept ready fordelivery on 14 December 1994. Thereafter, on 6 January 1995 the petitioners filed an applicationunder Section 28A(1) of the Act praying for re- determination of the amount of compensation on thebasis of the award of the Court. By the impugned communication dated 18 September 2008 theCollector rejected such application of the petitioners primarily on two grounds, firstly assigning areason that the original award being dated 15 February 1984, the provisions of 28A could not beavailed by the petitioners as the said provisions would not have a retrospective operation; andsecondly, even if the date of the modified award was considered to be 1 September 1994 (sic 5September 1994), the petitioners' application was barred by the limitation of three months, asprescribed by sub-section (1) of Section 28A.

Mr.Potnis, learned Counsel for the petitioners in assailing the impugned order passed by theCollector would submit that the Collector has failed to take into consideration that the originalAward of the Reference Court dated 15 February 1984 rendered on the reference application stoodmodified by the subsequent judgment and order dated 5 September 1994 passed by the ReferenceCourt on the review application. It is his submission that for the purposes of an application made bythe petitioners under Section 28A(1), the relevant award of the Reference Court was the award dated5 September 1994 (award on review), and not the original award dated 15 February 1984. Accordingto him, for the purposes of the claim as made by the original claimants, the final award in favour ofthe original claimants was the award dated 5 September 1994 rendered on the review application,which gave rise to a cause of action in favour of the petitioners to invoke the beneficial provisions ofSection 28A of the Act. He submits that the impugned order is required to be held illegal on both thereasons it attributes, to reject the petitioners applications. Mr. Potnis submits that the Collectorcould not have overlooked the award made by the Reference Court on the review application. Thus,according to him, there was no question of 21 wp6184-09grp any retrospective application of theprovisions of Section 28A of the Act in the facts of the present case, merely for the reason that theSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/15original award (prior to the review) was dated 15 February, 1984 (i.e. prior to the provisions ofSection 28A were brought into force). Mr.Potnis submits that such reason as set out in theimpugned order, is not only factually erroneous being oblivious to the final award dated 5September 1994 but also overlooks the application of Section 30 of the 1984 Amendment Actnamely the "transitory provisions", which clearly conferred the benefit of the amended provisions ofSection 23(2) and Section 28 of the Principal Act (by virtue of Sections 15 and 18 of the 1984Amendment Act), to matters which were pending adjudication before the reference Court. Insupport of this submission, Mr. Potnis has placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court inUnion of India Vs. Raghubir Singh1.12. The next submission of Mr.Potnis referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in Union ofIndia & Anr. Vs. Pradeep Kumari & Ors. 2 is to the effect that the Supreme Court has construed thewords "an award" used in Section 28-A(1) of the Act, to hold that the object underlying the saidprovision would be better achieved by giving such expression its natural meaning, namely, ameaning that the award that is made by the Court under Part III of the Act. Mr.Potnis submits thatthe Supreme Court 1(1989) 2 SCC. 754 2 (1995)2 SCC 736 22 wp6184-09grp has set out sixconditions which need to be satisfied for a person to be entitled to seek re-determination of theamount of compensation payable to him under Section 28A of the Act which according to him weresatisfied by the petitioners.13. On the second ground on which the petitioners application under Section 28A(1) was rejected bythe Collector, Mr.Potnis would submit that even in calculating the period of limitation, there is anapparent illegality committed by the Collector as, according to him, although the Collector hadnoted with relevance the review award dated 5 September 1994 on the basis of which the petitionershad submitted their application, however, the Collector overlooking "the proviso" below sub- section(1) of Section 28A, which provides that in calculating the period of limitation as prescribed bysub-section (1) the time which was taken from the date of pronouncement of the award (in thepresent case the review award) and obtaining a copy of such award would stand excluded. Mr.Potniswould, hence, contend that the impugned order on both the counts, is rendered illegal and isrequired to be quashed and set aside.14. On the other hand, Mr.Pawar, learned Assistant Government Pleader has supported theimpugned orders. It is his submission that the Collector is correct in his reasoning that theprovisions of Section 28A 23 wp6184-09grp cannot have retrospective operation as according tohim when the reference Court originally decided the reference on 15 February 1984, the amendedSection 28A was not in existence. In support of this contention Mr.Pawar has relied on the decisionof the Supreme Court in Babua Ram & Ors. Vs. State of U.P. & Anr..(1989) 2 SCC. 754 3 to contendthat in such decision the Supreme Court has held that the provisions of Section 28A do not haveretrospective application and that Section 28A was a complete code in itself. Mr.Pawar, however,would have no answer to the petitioners case that for the application as made by the petitionersunder the provisions of Section 28A(1), the proviso to sub-section (1) was relevant and was requiredto be noticed by the Collector in considering such applications, and more particularly when theCollector in the impugned order not only refers but also notices the modified award of the referenceCourt dated 5 September 1994. Mr. Pawar submits that the petitions do not warrant considerationSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/16and deserve to be dismissed.Reasons and conclusions15. There ought not to be any dispute on the proposition that by virtue of the order dated 5September 1994 passed by the Reference Court on the review application of the claimants, theoriginal award/judgment (dated 15 February 1984) on the land acquisition 3 (1995)2 SCC 689 24wp6184-09grp reference stood modified. In other words, the judgment and order dated 15 February1984 stood merged in the review orders/award passed on the review application, by application ofthe doctrine of merger. The principles in this regard are well settled, namely, that when anapplication for review of a decree is allowed, it results in vacating of the decree earlier passed. Thedecree that is subsequently passed on review, whether it modifies, reverses or confirms the decreeoriginally passed, is a new decree superseding the original one. To appreciate the concept of thedoctrine of merger, reference can be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Kunhayammed &Ors. Vs. State of Kerala & Anr. 4 as also the decision in Special Deputy Collector & Ors. Vs. ChakaliLinga & Ors. 516. In Kunhayammed & Ors. (supra) the Supreme Court has held that the doctrine of merger isneither a doctrine of constitutional law nor a doctrine statutorily recognised. It is a common lawdoctrine founded on principles of propriety in the hierarchy of justice delivery system. The logicbehind such doctrine being that there cannot be more than one decree or operative orders governingthe same subject-matter at a given point of time.17. In the context of the Land Acquisition Act such principle has been recognized by the SupremeCourt in Chakali Linga's case (supra). In this case, the Supreme Court was seized with an issue inregard to the benefit being claimed by Chakali Linga under the provisions of Section 4 (2000)6 SCC359 5 (2005)13 SCC 404 25 wp6184-09grp 23(2) of the Act, for award of solatium at 30%. An awardwas made by the land acquisition officer on 29 December 1975 against which a reference was madeby some claimants before the learned District Judge who enhanced the compensation by hisjudgment and order dated 31 March 1979. A review application came to be made in the year 1982praying for further enhancement in respect of the trees which were subject matter of acquisition.The review application was decided in favour of the original claimants by an order dated 31December 1983. In the year 1991, Chakali Linga filed an interlocutory application before thereference Court claiming benefit under Section 23(2) of the Act as amended by the 1984Amendment Act. It was Chakali Linga's case that the judgment and decree passed by the referenceCourt was reviewed by its order dated 31 December 1983 by granting enhanced compensation inrespect of trees. Thus, according to Chakali Linga the decree finally passed by the Reference Courtwas the one passed on 31 December 1983 namely on the review application, which modified theoriginal award/decree dated 31 March 1979. Taking recourse to the doctrine of merger, ChakaliLinga claimed that since the decree was passed by the Reference Court on 31 December 1983,applying the provisions of sub- section (2) of Section 30 of the 1984 Amendment Act, Chakali Lingawas entitled to solatium at the rate of 30% of the market value instead of 15% as earlier awarded.This contention of Chakali Linga was 26 wp6184-09grp accepted by the Reference Court andconfirmed by the High Court. The Special Deputy Collector, however, felt aggrieved by theSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/17concurrent findings namely that of the Reference Court and the High Court, hence, approached theSupreme Court. The Special Deputy Collector contended before the Supreme Court that decree ofthe Reference Court had attained finality so far as compensation payable for the land wasconcerned, and the review order merely modified the compensation for trees, hence according tohim, Chakali Linga could not have claimed higher solatium on compensation payable in respect ofthe land. It is in such context, the Supreme Court reiterating the settled principle of law andreferring to the decision in Sushil Kumar Sen Vs. State of Bihar6 and Kunhayammed & Ors. (supra)held that the law is well settled that the effect of allowing an application for review of a decree is tovacate the decree passed. It was held that the decree that is subsequently passed on review, whetherit modifies, reverses or confirms the decree originally passed, is a new decree superseding theoriginal one. Applying such principles of law, the Court repelled the contention of the SpecialDeputy Collector and dismissed the appeals, upholding Chakali Linga's contention. In my opinion,this decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case, to accept the petitioners'contention that the original award of the Reference Court dated 15 February 1984 had merged withthe modified award dated 5 September 1994.6 (1975)1 SCC 774                                      27                                wp6184-09grp18. In the context of merger, another decision of the Supreme Court in DSR Steel (Private) Ltd. Vs.State of Rajasthan & Ors. 7 needs to be noted. In this decision, the Supreme Court held that when aCourt makes an order allowing a review petition, it results into the decree/orders under reviewbeing reversed or modified. The modified order then become a composite order whereby the Courtnot only vacates the earlier decree or order but simultaneous with such vacation of the earlier decreeor order, passes another decree or order or modifies the one made earlier. It was held that it is onlythe decree so vacated, reversed or modified becomes the decree that is effective for the purposes of afurther appeal, if any, maintainable under law. The relevant extract of the said decision reads thus:-"25.2. The second situation that one can conceive of is where a Court or Tribunalmakes an order in a review petition by which the review petition is allowed and thedecree/order under review reversed or modified. Such an order shall then be acomposite order whereby the Court not only vacates the earlier decree or order butsimultaneous with such vacation of the earlier decree or order, passes another decreeor order or modifies the one made earlier. The decree so vacated reversed or modifiedis then the decree that is effective for purposes of a further appeal, if any,maintainable under law." (emphasis supplied)19. Adverting to the above settled principles of law in their application to the facts of the presentcase, it becomes abundantly clear that by application of the doctrine of merger, it is the judgmentand order of the Reference Court dated 5 September 1994 on the review 7 (2012)6 SCC 782 28wp6184-09grp application, which would be required to be considered as the new award/decree onthe Land Acquisition Reference in question, which superseded the original judgment and awarddated 15 February 1984 rendered by the reference Court. By virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 26 ofSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/18the Act every award made by the Reference Court is deemed to be a decree and the statement ofgrounds of every such award a judgment within the meaning of Section 2, Clause (2), and Section 2,Clause (9), respectively of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908.20. The principle of merger is thus implicitly recognised by the provisions of Section 26(2) of theAct, whereunder an award of the learned District Judge would be deemed to be a decree and suchaward would be a judgment within the meaning of Section 2, Clause (2), and Section 2, Clause (9) ofthe Code of Civil Procedure,1908. Hence, in the facts of the present case, for the purposes of anapplication under Section 28A(1) of the Act, it was the review judgment and award dated 5September 1994 of the Reference Court which was relevant for the petitioners, to take recourse tothe beneficial provisions of Section 28A of the Act.21. In my opinion, the approach of the Collector in rejecting the petitioners' application underSection 28A(1) was thus ex facie illegal for more than one reason. Firstly, the Collector proceeded onan 29 wp6184-09grp assumption that only the original award on the reference application dated 15February 1984 was relevant for the petitioners application to be maintainable under Section 28A(1)of the Act. The Collector referring to the date of the original award observes that the provisions ofSection 28A(1) were not brought into force when such award was made, he hence held that as theprovision is not applicable retrospectively, the petitioners application could not be entertained. Thefallacy in such reasoning can be instantly noted, namely, the Collector completely overlooking thelegal consequence emerging on the reference Court modifying the original award dated 15 February1984 by its orders passed on the review application on 5 September 1994. It is not possible toconceive that once the original award itself stood merged in the review award, the original awardcould still be considered of any relevance and utility without it being read with the modified award,which would be the real award for all relevant purposes even to the original claimants for thebenefits accrued to them for receiving compensation under the Act. In any case, in view of themodified award/orders passed by the Reference Court on the review application, no efficacy couldbe attributed to the original award also by application of the doctrine of merger as discussed above.The Collector, therefore, fell in a patent error in overlooking the legal consequences as broughtabout by the modified award, for the petitioners to maintain their 30 wp6184-09grp applicationsunder Section 28A(1) of the Act.22. The second ground on which the petitioners' application was rejected by the Collector is onlimitation. The Collector held the petitioners application to be time barred when in fact heproceeded to calculate the limitation by referring to the judgment/award of the reference Court onthe review application. According to the Collector as the Reference Court passed its order on thereference application on 1 September 1994 (sic 5 September 1994) and as the petitioners' applicationwas filed on 6 January 1995, the same was time barred being filed beyond the prescribed limitationof three months as provided under sub-section (1) of Section 28A. In attributing such reason, theCollector has fell in an apparent error and an illegality inasmuch as the Collector turned a blind eyeto proviso below Section 28A(1) which ordains that in computing the period of limitation of threemonths as prescribed under sub-section (1), the day on which the award was pronounced and thetime requisite for obtaining a copy of the award, shall be excluded. As noted above the petitionershad made an application for certified copy of the review award on 28 October 1994, and the reviewSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/19award was kept ready for delivery on 14 December 1994. Thus the period between 28 October 1994upto 14 December 1994 stood excluded in calculating the limitation, when the petitioners filed theirSection 28A application on 6 January 1995. Thus there is 31 wp6184-09grp total non-application ofmind by the Collector to the legal requirements as stipulated by the proviso to sub-section (1) ofsection 28A.23. Apart from the above discussion, the principles of law as laid down by the Supreme Court ininterpreting Section 28A(1) needs to be noted. Considering these decisions, what was relevant forapplicability of Section 28A(1) was the award made by the reference Court under Part III, aftercoming into force of Section 28A. A two judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Babua Ram & Ors.(supra) held that the period of three months prescribed for making an application forre-determination of compensation under Section 28A should be computed from the date of makingof the first award. It was held that limitation begins to run from the date, the award was pronouncedby the Court under Section26. It was thus held that re-determination of compensation can be made only on the basis of the firstaward that was made after coming into force of Section 28A of the Act. Such view was reiterated by aco- ordinate Bench of the Supreme Court in Karnail Singh (supra) which again held that the cause ofaction for making an application under section 28-A would arise when an award was made by theCivil Court, on a reference under section 18, enhancing the compensation over and above theamount awarded by the Collector in his award under section 11 and that the earliest of the successiveawards would furnish the starting period of the limitation of three months as provided in the 32wp6184-09grp proviso to section 28- A(l). Such was held to be the interpretation of the provisions ofsub-section (1) of Section 28A. It was reiterated that Section 28A(1) was applicable prospectivelywith effect from 24 September 1984 and hence, it did not furnish any right to the claimants to makeany application after the Act had come into force and when the award of the reference Court wasprior to the commencement of the 1984 Amendment Act. The decisions in Babua Ram & Ors.(supra) and Karnail Singh (supra) were however overruled by a three Judge Bench of the SupremeCourt in Union of India & Anr. Vs. Pradeep Kumari & Ors. (supra). In such decision, the SupremeCourt considering the statement of object and reasons of the 1984 Amendment Act observed thatthe object underlying the enactment of Section 28A was to remove inequality in the payment ofcompensation for same or similar quality of land, arising on account of inarticulate and poor peoplenot being able to take advantage of the right of reference to the civil court under Section 18 of theAct. It was observed that parity was sought to be achieved by providing an opportunity to allaggrieved parties whose land is covered by the said notification to seek re-determination once "anyof them" had obtained orders for payment of higher compensation from the reference Court underSection 18 of the Act. It was observed that Section 28-A was in the nature of a beneficial provisionintended to remove inequality and to give relief to the inarticulate and poor people 33wp6184-09grp who are not able to take advantage of the right of reference to the Civil Court underSection 18 of the Act. Applying the well-settled principles in interpreting beneficial legislations,namely that while construing such legislation, the Court should adopt a construction whichadvances the legislative policy to extend the benefit, rather than a construction which has the effectof curtailing the benefit the provisions would confer. The Supreme Court accordingly held that theright to make the application under Section 28-A arises from the award of the Court on the basis ofSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/20which the person making the application is seeking re-determination of the compensation. It washeld that there is nothing in sub-section (1) of Section 28-A to indicate that this right is confined inrespect of the earliest award that is made by the Court after the coming into force of Section 28-A. Itwas observed that by construing the expression 'where in an award under this Part' appearing insub- section (1) of Section 28- A to mean 'where in the first award made by the court under this Part,the word 'first', which is not found in sub-section (1) of Section 28-A, was being read in the saidprovisions, whereby the amplitude of the said provision was being curtailed so as to restrict thebenefit conferred by it. It is for such reason the Court observed that the view taken in Babua Ram &Ors. (supra) and Karnail Singh (supra) that an application under Section 28A can be made only onthe basis of the first award was not correct and accordingly overruled the said decisions. The Courtfurther 34 wp6184-09grp clarified that the benefit of Section 28A can be availed on the basis of anyone of the award that has been made by the Court after coming into force of Section 28A providedthat an application seeking such benefit was made within the prescribed period of three monthsfrom the making of the award on the basis of which such redetermination of compensation issought. The relevant observations of the Court are required to be noted:-"7. After giving our thoughtful consideration to the aforementioned reasons we areunable to persuade ourselves to take the view that the period of limitation for makingan application under Section 28-A of the Act has to be computed from the date of themaking of the first award after the coming into force of Section 28-A and anysubsequent award has no bearing on the right conferred by Section 28-A. ... .. .. .. .. .. .9. A perusal of the provisions contained in sub-section (1) of Section 28-A of the Actwould show that after an award is made under Part III whereby the court allows tothe applicant any amount of compensation in excess of the amount awarded by theCollector under Section 11, a right accrues to a person interested in the other landcovered by the same notification under sub-section (1) of Section 4 who is alsoaggrieved by the award of the Collector but who had not made an application to theCollector under Section 18, to move an application before the Collector forre-determination of the amount of compensation payable to him on the basis of theamount of compensation awarded by the court. This application for re-determination of compensation is required to be made within three months from thedate of the award of the court. The right to make the application under Section 28-Aarises from the award of the court on the basis of which the person making theapplication is seeking re-determination of the compensation. There is nothing insub-section (1) of Section 28-A to indicate that this right is confined in respect of theearliest award that is made by the Court after the coming into force of Section 28-A.By construing the expression 'where in an award under this Part' in sub- section (1) of Section 28-Ato mean 'where in the first award made by the court under this Part, the word 'first', which is notfound in sub-section (1) of Section 28-A, is being read therein and thereby the amplitude of the saidprovision is being curtailed so as to restrict the benefit conferred by it. In the matter of constructionof a beneficient provision it is not permissible by judicial interpretation to read words which are 35wp6184-09grp not there and thereby restrict the scope of the said provision. [See : Jnan Ranjan SenSambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/21Gupta v. Arun Kumar Bose, [1975] 2 SCC 526,530.]10. It is possible to visualise a situation where in the first award that is made by the court after thecoming into force of Section 28-A the enhancement in the amount of compensation by the saidaward is not very significant for the reason that the person who sought the reference was not able toproduce adequate evidence in support of his claim and in another reference where the award wasmade by the court subsequently such evidence is produced before the court and a much higheramount is awarded as compensation in the said award. By restricting the benefit of Section 28-A tothe first award that is made by the court after the coming into force of Section 28-A the benefit ofhigher amount of compensation on the basis of the subsequent award made by the court would bedenied to the persons invoking Section 28-A and the benefit of the said provision would be confinedto re-determination of compensation on the basis of lesser amount of compensation awarded underthe first award that is made after the coming into force of Section 28-A. There is nothing in thewordings of Section 28- A to indicate that the legislature intended to confer such a limited benefitunder Section 28-A. Similarly, there may be a situation, as in the present case, where thenotification under Section 4(1) of the Act covers lands falling in different villages and a number ofreferences at the instance of persons having lands in different villages were pending in the court onthe date of coming into force of Section 28-A and awards in those references are made by the courton different dates. A person who is entitled to apply under Section 28-A belonging to a particularvillage may come to know of the first award that is made by the court after the coming into force ofSection 28-A in a reference at the instance of a person belonging to another village, after the expiryof the period of three months from the date of the said award but he may come to know of thesubsequent award that is made by the court in the reference at the instance of a person belonging tothe same village before the expiry of the period of three months from the date of the said award. Thisis more likely to happen in the case of inarticulate and poor people who cannot be expected to keeptrack of all the references that were pending in court on the date of coming into force of Section28-A and may not be in a position to know, in time, about the first award that is made by the courtafter the coming into force of Section 28-A. By holding that the award referred to in Section 28-A(l)is the first award made after the coming into force of Section 28-A, such persons would be deprivedof the benefit extended by Section 28-A. Such a construction would thus result in perpetuating theinequality in the payment of compensation which the legislature wanted to remove by enactingSection 28-A. The object underlying Section 28-A would be better achieved by giving the 36wp6184-09grp expression "an award" in Section 28-A its natural meaning as meaning the awardthat is made by the court in Part III of the Act after the coming into force of Section 28-A. If the saidexpression in Section 28-A(l) is thus construed, a person would be able to seek re-determination ofthe amount of compensation payable to him provided the following conditions are satisfied :-(i) An award has been made by the court under Part III after the coming into force of Section 28-A;(ii) By the said award the amount of compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collectorunder Section 11 has been allowed to the applicant in that reference;(iii) The person moving the application under Section 28-A is interested in other land covered by thesame notification under Section 4(1) to which the said award relates;Sambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/22(iv) The person moving the application did not make an application to the Collector under Section18;(v) The application is moved within three months from the date of the award on the basis of whichthe re-determination of amount of compensation is sought; and(vi) Only one application can be moved under Section 28-A for re- determination of compensationby an applicant.11. Since the cause of action for moving the application for re-determination of compensation underSection 28-A arises from the award on the basis of which re-determination of compensation issought, the principle that "once the limitation begins to run, it runs in its full course until its runningis interdicted by an order of the court" can have no application because the limitation for moving theapplication under Section 28-A will begin to run only from the date of the award on the basis ofwhich re-determination of compensation is sought.12. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the view expressed in Babua Ram (supra) and KarnailSingh (supra) that application under Section 28-A for re-determination of compensation can only bemade on the basis of the first award that is made after the coming into force of Section 28-A. In ouropinion, the benefit of re-determination of amount of compensation under Section 28-A can beavailed of on the basis of any one of the awards that has been made by the court after the cominginto force of Section 28-A provided the applicant seeking such benefit makes the application underSection 28-A within the prescribed period of three months from the making of the award on thebasis of which re-determination is sought, The first contention urged by Shri Goswamy in support ofthe Review Petitions is, therefore, rejected.                                     (emphasis supplied)                                   37                            wp6184-09grp24. For the aforesaid reasons, Mr.Pawar is not correct in his contention that the petitions involvedretrospective application of the provisions of Section 28A of the Act, relying on the decision of theSupreme Court in Babua Ram & Ors. (supra) as in the present case the modified award itself isdated 5 September 1994 which formed the basis of the petitioners application under section 28A, byvirtue of which there was no question of any retrospective application of Section 28A of the Act.25. Mr.Potnis would also be correct in his contention relying on the decision of the Supreme Courtin Union of India Vs. Raghubir Singh (supra) that the provisions of Section 30 (Transitoryprovisions) of the 1984 Amendment Act in any case had become applicable even to the pendingreferences.26. As a sequel to the above decision, the Collector could not have rejected the petitionersapplication on both the grounds as recorded in the impugned order, namely, of retrospectiveapplication of Section 28A, when there was none as also on the second ground of the petitionersapplication being time barred. The impugned order is manifestly illegal and is liable to be set aside.Sambhaji Vikram Gutal vs The Special Land Acquisition ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165343367/23It is thus clear to me that the applications under Section 28A(1) as filed by the petitioners, weremaintainable and they ought to have been processed further as per the requirement of sub-section(2) of the Act.38 wp6184-09grp27. In view of the above deliberation, the petitions need to succeed. They are accordingly allowed interms of the following order:-ORDER (I) The impugned orders passed by the Collector rejecting the petitioners'applications under Section 28A(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 stand quashedand set aside.(II) The applications of the petitioners under Section 28A are restored to file of theCollector to be processed further in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2)of Section 28A of the Act.(III) As the acquisition itself is of the year 1969, the Collector is directed to completethe inquiry under sub-section (2) of Section 28A of the Act within a period of sixmonths from today and make appropriate award in re-determining compensationpayable to the petitioners.(IV) All contentions of the parties on merits of their respective claim applications areexpressly kept open.(V) Rule is made absolute in the above terms.
