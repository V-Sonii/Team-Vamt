According to the learned counsel for the accused, they are falsely implicated in the crime inquestion. Learned counsel Shri Daga's submissions can be cataloged as under :-a] There is a delay of three hours in lodging the first information report and that is not explained atall.b] Name of accused no.2 was not figuring in the first information report still subsequently he wasarrayed as accused in the crime.c] Though, from the evidence and the report, the "father" was knowing accused no.2, may be by face,for the reasons best known to the "father", he did not implicate him in the first information report.d] The identification of accused no.2 in evidence by PW3 Shivaji is unsafe to accept inasmuch as inhis evidence he did state that his name was disclosed to him by other Security Guard Shri 24CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Sasane.

Per contra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor Shri S.S. Doifode vehemently supported thereasoning given by the learned Special Judge. He painstakingly pointed out as to how evidence ofthe "victim" is reliable and trustworthy. He pointed out the material from record as to how the"victim" could know accused no.1. He pointed out that evidence of the "victim" and "father" are freefrom any omission and contradiction and their evidence inspires confidence.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that multiple injuries found on the private partof the victim shows the degree of torture on a minor girl, aged about 9 years, by committing rape. Hesubmitted that once it is found that evidence of the "victim" is trustworthy and it can be safelyaccepted, the perpetrators of the crime cannot escape from legal punishment. He also submittedthat 27 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt the learned Special Judge was right in imposing punishment of deathsince both the accused are beasts, who in order to fulfill their sexual lust have committed sexualatrocities on a minor girl. He, therefore, submitted that the reference be answered in affirmative andthe appeals filed by both the accused be dismissed. CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROSECUTIONCASE.A] First Information Report.13. It is a trite law that the first information report does not constitute substantive evidence. It canbe used as a previous statement for the purpose of corroborating either its maker under Section 157of the Indian Evidence Act, or for contradicting him under Section 145 of the said Act. The firstinformation report's importance is that it conveys earliest information regarding the occurrence sothat it cannot be doubted. These are the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex Court.14. In the present case, the criminal law was set into motion by "father" (PW1). He lodged his oralreport dated 27.04.2019 with Police Station, Chikhali, which is at Exh.19. The printed first 28CriConfCs01.20+2.odt information report is at Exh.19-A.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/12In paragraph 9 of this judgment, the contents of the first information report are elaboratelydiscussed. Therefore, in order to avoid repetition and to avoid bulkiness, we are not again discussingthe factual matrix as stated in the first information report at this stage.15. The first submission of the learned counsel for the accused persons, as cataloged above, is thatthere is a delay of three hours in registration of the crime, which is not explained and according tothe learned counsel, it is fatal to the prosecution.16. Let us examine this submission.Sub clause (b) of Column 3 of the printed first information report (Exh.19A) shows that theinformation of the occurrence was received at Police Station early in the morning at 4.00 O'clock on27.04.2019, whereas the date and time of the first information report in the said printed firstinformation report shows as 27.04.2019 at 8.37 a.m. The unchallenged version of "father" (PW1)shows that 29 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt he and his wife were searching for their daughter, the "victim",since 2.00 a.m. on 27.01.2019 when they noticed her absence on the bed and during search theynoticed their daughter coming in frightened condition having blood on her clothes in front ofMounibaba Sansthan. As per the printed first information report (Exh.19A), the distance betweenpolice station and the place of occurrence is 2 kilometers. The learned counsel for the accusedpointed out from evidence of PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh that the distance between police station andthe graveyard is about one kilometer and the distance between police station and APMC market isalso about one kilometer. He, therefore, submitted that though the printed first information reportshows that the information was received at the police station at 4.00 O'clock in the morning, for thereasons best known to the prosecution, the crime was registered at 8.37 a.m.17. The printed first information report shows that the oral report lodged by "father" (PW1) wasreduced into writing by PSI K.K. Khade. Though, PSI Khade was not examined by the prosecution,the contents of the first information report were duly proved by the maker i.e. "father" (PW1).30 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh would state in his evidence that on 27.04.2019at 4.00 a.m. he received information from PSI Khade that two persons have committed sexualassault on a 9 year old girl. Therefore, he immediately rushed to police station where he came toknow that the "victim" and her parents were taken by police to the Rural Hospital, Chikhli. In ourview, this postulates that at 4.00 O'clock in the morning when the "victim" along with her parentshad been to the police station, looking to the physical appearance of the victim, PSI Khade rightlytook them to Rural Hospital, Chikhali and in the meanwhile, he reported the occurrence to hissuperior PW14 Gulabrao Wagh. Of course, it was well open for PSI Khade to reduce into writing theentire narration of the "father" and register the first information report at 4.00 a.m itself, however,in such cases it was a natural reaction of a sensitive person, first to take immediate step to providemedical help to the victim, aged about 9 years by taking her along with her parents to the hospital.Even the evidence of PW6 Dr. Vijaya Kharpas, Medical Officer of Rural Hospital, Chikhli wouldshow that the "victim" was brought to her at 4.00 O'clock in the morning on 27.04.2019 and she wasaccompanied by her parents. In her cross-examination, it was brought on record that she started 31CriConfCs01.20+2.odt examining the victim at 4.15 a.m. The contemporaneous document, theSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/13forensic medical examination report (Exh.43A) of the victim also shows that Dr. Kharpas examinedthe "victim" at 4.15 a.m. From this, it is very clear that PSI Khade had shown sense of urgency andfirst took the girl to the hospital so that she can get the required medical assistance. It must be histhought process that the formality of registration of the crime can be deferred for a little while, butthe first step is to provide immediate medical help. We approve this particular approach on the partof PSI Khade. Some time must have consumed by Dr. Kharpas after she started medicalexamination of the "victim". Exh.42 is the history given by "father" to Dr. Kharpas. It shows that thewriting was started at 4.30 a.m. It appears that after medical examination of the victim, she and herparents came to police station and that time detail statement of "father" was reduced into writing byPSI Khade at 8.37 a.m. and Crime No. 245/2019 came to be registered against accused no.1 and oneunknown person for the offence punishable under Sections 366-A, 376(DB), 506 of the IPC andunder Section 6 of the POCSO Act.32 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt18. One limb of the submissions of learned counsel Shri Daga on this aspect is that the parentsfound the "victim" at 2.00 a.m. The distance, even as per Exh.19A, between the police station andthe spot of occurrence, is two kilometers and still they reached to police station at 4.00 a.m. forwhich there is no explanation and therefore, the possibility of false implication of the accused in thecrime, is not completely ruled out.19. We are afraid that this submission has any merit. When the parents found the "victim" comingfrom Mounibaba sansthan on her foot, she was alone. Not only that, they found their daughter notonly in a frightened condition, but the clothes on her person were smeared with blood. Visualizingthe state of mind of the parents at that time, we are sure that they must have completely shattered intheir mind and were absolutely dumbstruck and their thought process must have completelystopped and the only thought that must be creeping in their mind was to provide immediate help totheir unfortunate daughter. From the first information report, it appears that "father" made anenquiry with the "victim" that time and she disclosed the horrifying act committed on her by theaccused 33 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt persons. Undisputedly, "father" hails from lower strata of thesociety. His unchallenged version shows that he used to do labour work at APMC and in order tosupplement his earning, he used to do work of watchman in the night at Mahesh Traders and alsoused to sleep along with his family members including the victim in a tin-shed in front of MaheshTraders. It clearly shows that he was not having any vehicle with him. Some time must haveconsumed to cover the distance of two kilometers. Therefore, the evidence of unfortunate father thathe reached to police station at 4.00 O'clock cannot be doubted. In our view, the aforesaidcircumstances themselves have explained the fact that though the parents found the victim at about2.00 am, why they reached to the Police Station at 4.00 a.m. and the crime was registered at 8.37a.m. In our view the justice will be the victim if the prosecution case is thrown merely because thecrime was registered at 8.37 a.m. though the information was received at 4.00 O'clock in themorning. In view of above discussion, we have no hesitation in our mind to reject the submissionmade by the learned counsel for the accused that the prosecution case must fall because ofunexplained delay of three hours in registration of crime.                                  34                      CriConfCs01.20+2.odtSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/14 B]        AGE AND CASTE OF THE VICTIM :-20. AGE :- As per the oral report (Exh.19), "father" is having three daughters. The eldest is thevictim, whose age is shown as 9 years and his other daughters at the relevant time were aged about 6years and 5 years. The date of birth of the "victim" is not disclosed in the first information report.21. During examination-in-chief of the "victim", she has specifically stated her date of birth as27.01.2009 and in her cross- examination it was brought on record that at the relevant time she wasstudying in 5th standard. The "father" also gave date of birth of the victim as 27.01.2009 and statedthat her birth took place in a Government Hospital. This particular evidence was not challenged byany of the accused when "father" was cross-examined by two different learned counsel.The date of birth is duly proved by the prosecution during the course of trial by examining RajuWamanrao Deshmukh (PW9). This prosecution witness was discharging his duties as Senior Clerkat Nagar Parishad, Chikhli and he was in-charge of maintaining the Birth and Death Records. As perthe evidence of 35 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Dy.S.P. Mahamuni (PW15), when he took investigation tohimself, he issued a letter (Exh.54) to Municipal Council, Chikhli for obtaining birth certificate ofthe "victim". In pursuance to the said, he received birth certificate from the Municipal Councilmentioning the date of birth as 27.01.2009. When PW9 Raju Deshmukh was in the Court, he washaving original record with him pertaining to the date of birth of the "victim". He proved the birthcertificate (Exh.55).22. PW6 Dr. Kharpas, who examined the victim firstly on 27.04.2019 early in the morning at 4.15am, found that there were no hairs over pubic area of the victim and therefore, she could not obtainthe samples. The learned counsel for the accused persons have fairly admitted that the victim was"child" within the meaning of section 2(d) of the POCSO Act and even during trial the claim of the"victim" that she was born on 27.01.2009 was never challenged. The date of the incident is27.04.2019. Therefore, though in the report the age of the victim was stated as 9 years, she was agedabout 10 years and 3 months, but of course, the victim was "child" at the relevant time.36 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt23. CASTE - In the report (Exh.19) itself and also in the evidence, "father" (PW1) gave name of thecaste to which he belongs and the said is 'Scheduled Caste".PW15 Dy.S.P. Mahamuni gave a letter to "father" for producing his caste certificate. He received thesame from "father", which was produced on record. The caste certificate which was produced onrecord along with the charge-sheet is duly proved by the prosecution by examining Ravi Dinkar Tale(PW7). As per the evidence of PW7 Ravi Tale, S.D.O., by issuing order to him, had authorized him toadduce evidence in the trial. The said order is at Exh.49. It is clear from the evidence of this witnessthat at the time of adducing his evidence, he had brought original records with him. He had alsobrought certified copy of the caste certificate (Exh.21), which was produced on record by "father".Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/15The certified copy of the caste certificate brought in the Court by PW7 Ravi Tale is at Exh.21A. Hisevidence shows that the contents of Exh.21 were as per the record. Though, in hiscross-examination, the defence tried to challenge his evidence by giving him suggestion that he hasnot personally verified whether the victim belong to a particular caste or not, he denied the same.37 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Once it was found that the contents of Exh.21, the caste certificate,produced on record by "father" were in consonance with the original record and when this official(PW7) produced certified copy of Exh.21 and which was taken on record by the learned Judge asExh.21A, we have no doubt in our mind to record a finding that the family of the victim and the"victim" belong to a caste, which is a 'Scheduled Caste'.C] MEDICAL EVIDENCE24. From the first information report, it is clear that during search of the victim by her parents, theynoticed the "victim" was coming towards her house on foot. When they noticed her, they found thatshe was in frightened condition and her clothes were smeared with blood. From the firstinformation report, it is clear that at 4.00 O'clock in the morning, "father" along with the "victim"reached to police station.25. From the evidence of PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh, it is clear that at 4.00 O'clock in the morning, hereceived information from PSI Khade about commission of sexual assault on a minor girl. He, 38CriConfCs01.20+2.odt therefore, immediately rushed to the police station where he was informedthat the "victim" is already taken to the hospital.26. Dr. Vijaya Kharpas (PW6) was posted at Rural Hospital, Chikhli on 27.4.2019. At 4.00 O'clock inthe morning Lady Police Constable brought the "victim" to her for examination in relation to sexualassault. Exh.41 is the communication given to the Medical Officer, Rural Hospital, Chikhli by PSIKhade requesting the Medical Officer to conduct medical examination of the "victim". Accordingly,Dr. Kharpas started examination of the "victim". PW6 Dr. Kharpas also obtained consent from theparents of the "victim" she being minor for her examination. Obviously, the "victim" being minor,she obtained history from the parents about the incident. "Father" narrated the history, which wasnoted down on paper by Dr. Kharpas and she also obtained signature of the "father". The saiddocument is at Exh.42.27. It appears that after doing these preliminary things, Dr. Kharpas started medical examination ofthe "victim". Dr. Kharpas, on victim's genital examination, found following injuries -39 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt 1] Bleeding was present over inner side of thigh, inner side labia majora,labia minora, bleeding per vagina present.2] Tear is present over posterior part of vagina extending towards anus just anterior to anus openinginvolving skin deep.3] Some secretions thin, whitish in colour mixed with blood is seen just below this tear.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr.

PW6 Dr. Kharpas also obtained nail sample, blood sample both plain and EDTA of the victim,however since there were no hairs over pubic area, hair sample could not be taken. She also tooksamples of vaginal swab, urethral swab. She found that the clothes of the victim were stained withblood. Dr. Kharpas thereafter sealed the samples and handed over the same to a Lady PoliceConstable, who was on duty.29. Evidence of PW6 Dr. Kharpas would further show that sexual assault was on a minor i.e. 'child'and it was a matter under POCSO, she gave certificate in the format (Exh.43A). She also issuedcertificate after giving treatment to the victim. Certificate (Exh.43A) 40 CriConfCs01.20+2.odtcontains victim's medical examination, injuries noticed by the Doctor, samples taken by the Doctorand the treatment advise.30. According to the opinion of Dr. Kharpas (PW6), the injuries found on the person of the "victim"were approximately 4-6 hours old and she examined the victim after 2-3 hours of the incident.31. The record would show that Dr. Kharpas (PW6) by giving referral card (Exh.46) referred the"victim" to Buldhana Civil Hospital for gynec opinion.32. The prosecution has examined Dr. Manisha Chavan (PW11), who was posted as Gynecologist atCivil Hospital, Buldhana on 27.04.2019. Her evidence would show that the "victim" was brought tothe hospital by a Lady Police Constable. The Casualty Medical Officer recorded history of thepatient, which was of sexual assault. Thereafter, Dr. Manisha Chavan was called. She went incasualty and examined the victim. She found that there was active bleeding. Therefore, the victimwas taken to Operation Theater (OT) As per the evidence of PW11 Dr. Manisha, she explored the"victim"41 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt under spinal anesthesia. She found laceration injury over right and leftlateral vaginal wall. On further examination, she found posterior pouch of douglas was open, bowelswere also seen from vagina. Evidence of Dr. Manisha would reveal that as condition of the "victim"was very serious and could not alone handle her, she called Dr. Bhusari as well as two Gynecologists.These Doctors were called for proper management of the "victim".In order to stop active bleeding, stitches were applied. Dr. Manisha further states from the witnessbox that she put mop for prevention of infection to the bowel. It would be useful to mention herethat before the patient was taken to OT, Dr. Manisha did not forget to obtain consent from theparents, the "victim" being minor. Dr. Manisha proved the medical case papers, which were in herSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/17own handwriting and which bear her signature. When she was in witness box, her attention wasdrawn to the medical papers which were running form page 46 to 57. She proved the same. Thosewere collectively marked as Exh.59.33. It was decided by Dr. Manisha to refer the "victim" to the Government Medical Collage andHospital, Aurangabad and for that 42 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt she gave referral form under hersignature. The said referral form is at Exh.60. Perusal of the said proved document would show thata request was made to the authorities of the Government Medical College, Aurangabad foradmission of the victim. The summary of diagnosis as shown in Exh.60 , is as under :"PV - 30 perennial tear, anal sphincter injury, all vaginal wall laceration, open, pouchof douglas for exploratory laparotomy and further treatment."34. After the victim was referred to Aurangabad, she was taken there. Insofar as victim'sexamination at Aurangabad is concerned, the victim was examined by two Doctors, they were Dr.Vijay Yashwant Kalyankar (PW10) and Dr. Sanjay Bhaskarrao Pagare (PW12). On oath, PW10 Dr.Kalyankar deposed that on 27.04.2019 he was Associate Professor at Government Medical College,Aurangabad and he was discharging emergency duty of a Unit, which he was leading. At 9.45 p.m.,the "victim" was brought to him. She was in emergency. Dr. Kalyankar would state that she wasreferred from Buldhana Civil Hospital. As per evidence of Dr. Kalyankar. The notes of BuldhanaCivil Hospital would show that the "victim" was examined under spinal anesthesia. He found thatpouch of douglas torn for 3 to 4 cms and bowel loops could be seen through it.43 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt35. Evidence of PW10 Dr. Kalyankar further shows that the "victim" was examined and thereaftershe was taken to Operation Theater for exploration and vaginal tear repair. Under his directions, the"victim" was taken for surgery. Operating surgeons were Dr. Sanjay Pagare (PW12), Dr. PawanBendale and Dr. Aulia Nasreen.Evidence of PW10 Dr. Kalyankar would state that on operation table, the findings were as under :1] There was III rd degree perennial tear with open pouch of douglas. The pouch ofdouglas was sutured after taking Surgeon's opinion. 2] IIIrd degree perennial tearwas repaired. There was no bleeding now. Post operatively the patient recoveredhealth. She was observed for five days thereafter in the ward."36. Dr. Sanjay Pagare (PW12) had operated the victim. His evidence would show that he found thatthe victim was having injuries on vaginal part. He noticed that there was third degree perennial tear.Therefore, pouch of douglas was opened. He operated on those injuries and repaired it. According tooperating Doctor, PW12 Pagare, these injuries were serious and grievous. According to the Doctor,those injuries were because of forceful sexual intercourse. He found the injuries fresh and madewithin 24 hours.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr.

Her signature was identified by PW10 Dr. Kanyankar, Head of the Department andAssociate Professor. So also the discharge card was signed by Dr. Priyanka Kesarwani, whosesignature was also identified by PW10 Dr. Kanyankar. Total 15 pages running from page nos.65 to80 were collectively marked as Exh.57.38. The noting at Buldhana hospital on 27.04.2019 at 9.30 a.m, which is a part of Exh.59, showsthat Dr. Manisha Chavan (PW11) gave an understanding to the "father" that health of the victim wascritical. The same was acknowledged by the "father". Thus, it is clear that the Doctors at Buldhanatook right step by referring the victim to Aurangabad Government Medical College for bettermanagement of the victim, who was in critical condition. From the evidence of PW10 Dr. Kanyankarand PW12 Dr. Pagare and from contemporaneous document (Exh.57), it is clear that in the wisdomof the team of Doctors, operation was required to be done and therefore, the victim was taken in theOperation Theater and the 45 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt operation was done from 12.00 to 12.30 am on28.04.2019, as it could be seen from the noting made under head "Operative Details" of dischargecard.39. During trial, the line of cross-examination of all the Doctors, who examined the "victim" at threedifferent places, was that the injuries received by the "victim" on her vaginal part was due to shefalling on a pointed thing.40. Even before this Court, the learned counsel for the accused tried to make capital out of thestatement made by Dr. Kharpas (PW6) in her cross-examination that such type of injury is possibleif somebody falls on pointed thing.Though, same type of suggestion was given to Dr. Manisha (PW11), she stoutly denied the same.Similar suggestions were given to Dr. Pagare (PW12). During cross-examination conducted onbehalf of accused no.2 Nikhil, following was brought on record :"It is not true to say that such type of injuries are not possible due to sexual assault.Witness volunteers that except severe sexual assault, those injuries are not possible."46 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt PW10 Dr. Kalyankar, Associate Professor also deniedstoutly the suggestions put to him regarding cause of injuries, which according to thedefence was due to falling on hard and blunt object.Doctors also denied stoutly the suggestion given that the injuries found could be due to repairingpouch of douglas. From the cross- examination of Dr. Kalyankar (PW10), following was brougnt onrecord :Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/19"It is not true to say that this injury was done while repairing pouch of douglas.Witness volunteers that this type of injury only occurs due to sexual intercourse. It isnot true to say that such type of injury is not possible due to sexual intercourse.Injury was so serious that bowel loops could be seen through the vagina andtherefore, patient was referred to us."41. While appreciating the prosecution case, it is the duty of the Court to appreciate the entireevidence as a whole. It is not expected from the Court to give undue importance to the straystatements found in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Evidence of a particular witnessincluding Doctors cannot be read in bits and pieces. The entire evidence of the witnesses has to beread as whole and much importance cannot be attributed to the stray admission made in suchevidence.47 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt42. In this case, the suggestion given to the Doctors by the learned defence counsel that the injuriesas noticed on genital part of the victim were caused due to fall on a pointed object, were given by thelearned defence counsel out of cough. No scientific data or material in that behalf in the nature ofany research paper, books by well known authors were pressed into service at the time of cross-examination of those Doctors. Another reason for discarding the said defence is that the provedevents show that the "victim" received injuries on her person in between 1.00 am to 2.00 am at aplace which is more than 1 kilometer away from the tin shed where she was sleeping along with herparents. It is impossible even to visualize that the "victim" at such time will go away to that placealone even for answering natures call and will receive injuries. In such a situation, we reject thesubmission made in that behalf by the learned counsel for the accused and accept the entire medicalevidence oral as well as documentory, which were contemporary of each stage when the victim wasmedically examined.43. We, therefore, agree that the prosecution case that was proved and disclosed before the Courtthrough the Doctors, who 48 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt examined the "victim", that the injuries foundon the genital part of the "victim" were caused to her due to forcible sexual intercourse and due tothe said, she received bleeding injuries on her private part and the injuries were critical requiringthe "victim" to transfer firstly to Buldhana and from there to Aurangabad.44. Here, we would like to appreciate the Doctors at Chikhli, Buldhana and Aurangabad, who shownsense of urgency to provide immediate medical help. At Buldhana, Doctor sutured to control activebleeding and at Aurangabad, ultimately the "victim" was required to undergo an operation. In ourview, due to the timely intervention by the Doctors, precious life of the "victim" was saved.45. Another submission of the learned counsel for the accused persons was that except injuries ongenital part, there were no injuries on other part of the body of the "victim".On this aspect, Exh.43A would show that apart from injuries on genital parts, the victim was havingredness over lower back. This aspect goes in conformity with the prosecution case that on a cementSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/20ota, sexual assault was made on the victim.49 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt46. Learned counsel for the accused also submitted by reading out notes of evidence of PW8 Dr.Nutan Kale and PW5 Dr. Sachin Kadam and their medical certificates that no nail scratches werefound on person of any of the accused. He submitted that it would be impossible that forcible sexualassault was made on a woman and there were no marks of resistance on the person of the accused.47. Firstly, accused no.1 was arrested. He was referred for his medical examination at RuralHospital, Chikhli on 27.4.2019. After examining him, Dr. Kale (PW8) issued a certificate (Exh.52).Similarly, after arrest of accused no.2, he was brought for his medical examination at Civil Hospital,Buldhana on 29.04.2019 and he was examined by Dr. Sachin Kadam (PW5). His medical certificateis at Exh.39.48. True it is that on a perusal of respective medical certificates of the accused persons, no nailmarks or scratches were found on their body, however, merely because of that, we are not ready toaccept the submission made on behalf of the accused persons that it is a pointer for their innocence.50 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt49. We cannot forget that the "victim" in this case is hardly 10 years of age. She was subjected tosexual assault by two fully grown male persons. The victim, therefore, was easily overpowered bythese two accused persons, who were like beasts at the relevant time. It would be too far expectationfrom this little girl to assault on these two beasts when they were in the process of ghastly sexualassault on her. We, therefore, have no hesitation in our mind to reject this contention on behalf ofthe accused persons.50. To complete on this aspect, we would like to consider one of the submissions of the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor that in fact both the accused persons have admitted before the Doctorsthat they have committed sexual assault on the victim and therefore, according to the learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor, it is an extra judicial confession. For that, he invited our attention tothe history noted down by Dr. Nutan Kale (PW8) given by accused no.1 Sagar. He invited ourattention to document Exh.51A under head 'Medical and Surgical History' and submitted thataccused no.1 himself has admitted that he has performed forcible sexual intercourse. Similarly, foraccused no.2 Nikhil, he invited our 51 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt attention to such noting in Exh.39.51. In our view, the submission as advanced by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor must fall onthe ground.52. After the arrest, both the accused persons were brought before two different Doctors for theirmedical examination. They were brought under custody before the Medical Officers. Therefore, weare of the view that even if such history was narrated by them, it was not voluntary, rather it wasmade when they were in custody. Therefore, in our view, the portion of both the documents to thatSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/21extent is inadmissible in evidence.D] IDENTIFICATION :-53. During the course of the arguments, Mr. Daga, learned counsel for accused no.2 Nikhilstraneously urged before the Court about identification of the said accused. In fact substantial partof his argument was covering this issue only. It was his submission that there was no properidentification of accused no.2 to show that he had participation in the offence.52 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt54. Mr. Daga opened his arguments with a submission that name of accused no.2 did not figure inthe first information report. He also submitted that his name cropped up only when, according tothe prosecution, accused no.1 Sagar during his interrogation disclosed his name and thereafter hewas arrayed as accused in the crime in question. He also submitted that though "father" wasknowing him still he did not disclose his name in the first information report. Another limb of hissubmissions was that it would be unsafe to accept evidence of PW3 Shivaji because he was notknowing accused no.2, but his identity was disclosed to him by co-watchman one Shri Sasane andsaid Sasane was not examined during the course of the trial. The learned counsel also submitted thatPW3 Shivaji did state in his cross-examination that he had not seen clearly the faces of the personswho were on Scooty. His further submission was that it would be really unsafe to accept the evidenceof PW3 Shivaji because it was night time and in absence of source of light, he could see accusedno.2. Insofar as identification by the "victim" is concerned, the learned counsel submitted that evenas per the prosecution case, the victim was taken to a secluded place where rape was committed onher and looking to the spot of the incident, it 53 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt is clear that there was nosource of light at that place.Another submission of the learned counsel was that there is omission of word "fat" person in thefirst information report.55. The learned counsel further submitted that though during the course of investigation, testidentification parade was held, it was held belatedly. He also submitted that no steps were taken bythe Investigating Officer for holding test identification parade in respect of accused no.2 either from"father" or PW3 Shivaji. He also submitted that both the panch witnesses regarding identificationparade were not examined. He submitted that even though during the course of identificationparade, the victim has identified accused no.2, she has not stated about his role in the identificationparade. In order to buttress his submission, the learned counsel has relied upon the following cases :1] 1995 Supp (4) SCC 448 (Shatrughana @ Satrughana Parida and others .vs. State ofOrissa) 2] (1972) 4 SCC 773 (Sheikh Hasib @ Tabarak .vs. State of Bihar) 3] (2015) 6SCC 623 (Iqbal and another .vs. State of Uttar Pradesh) 54 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt56. Mr. Daga, learned counsel also submitted that even during trial the victim has identified accusedno.2 Nikhil only through his photograph. He also questions as to how the victim could disclose hisSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/22name from the witness box.57. By making aforesaid submissions regarding identity, the learned counsel sum up that there wasno admissible evidence against accused no.2 Nikhil available in the entire prosecution case andtherefore, that itself is sufficient to discard the prosecution case against him.58. Mr. Dhawas, learned counsel for accused no.1 Sagar submitted that he will not offer anysubmission about the identity since name of accused no.1 not only was figuring in the firstinformation report, but he was known to the victim.59. Learned counsel also submitted that on the question of seizure of Scooty, the prosecution hasnot examined Vijay Gadekar, from in front of whose house it was seized. Therefore, according tohim, seizure of Scooty is also suspicious.55 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt60. Per contra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor Mr. Doifode submitted that the prosecutionwas successful in establishing the identify of accused no.2 as one of the culprits. He submitted that ifevidence of PW3 Shivaji is evaluated in the whole background of the prosecution case, then therewill be no other way but to accept his evidence in respect of identity of accused no.2. On the aspectof source of light, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that this Court can takejudicial notice of certain facts. He submitted that the incident in question had occurred on27.04.2019. He, with the assistance of calender "Kalnirnay", has pointed out that 18.04.2019 was afull moon night ( Pornima) and 04.05.2019 was the night of no moon (Amavasya). He, therefore,submitted that there was sufficient moon light on the day of the incident and therefore, "victim"could recognize accused no.2 while committing rape on her.61. We have given our anxious thought and consideration to the submissions made by both thelearned counsel.62. On the point of delay in holding test identification parade of accused no.2, Mr. Daga, learnedcounsel has pressed into 56 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt service judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court inShatrughna Parida's case (supra). In this case, test identification parade was held after 1½ monthsafter the occurrence in question. The learned counsel for the appellant therein, therefore, submittedthat the Apex Court should set aside the conviction and sentence. Admittedly, in the case at hand,test identification parade was conducted on 15.06.2019 i.e. after 50 days of the occurrence.Therefore, according to the learned counsel for accused no.2, test identification parade has to bediscarded in view of Shatrughna Parida's case (supra).63. Each prosecution case has to be evaluated as per the facts brought on record. A careful readingof the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Shatrughna Parida's case would show that except testidentification parade, there was no other corroborative evidence. In the case at hand, theprosecution is not only relying on test identification parade of accused no.2 alone, but theprosecution is also heavily relying on proved facts through scientific evidence to corroborate its case.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/23Therefore, we have no difficulty to record here with respect that the judgment in ShatrughnaParida's case (supra) cannot be made applicable in the present matter.57 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt64. Insofar as the rulings in Sheikh Hasib and Iqbal's cases (supra) are concerned, the facts involvedin these reported cases are entirely different than the case at hand and therefore, in our view, thelearned counsel for accused no.2 was not right in placing reliance on the said two judgments.65. By catena of decisions including Sheikh Hasib's case (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court has ruledthat substantive evidence is the statement of witnesses in the Court. The test identification parade isheld to lend assurance that the investigation is on right path. The Hon'ble Apex Court in SheikhHasib's case has ruled that if there is no substantive evidence about the person having been one ofthe accused persons when the witness saw them at the time of occurrence of the offence, then testidentification parade against him cannot be of any assistance to the prosecution. Keeping thisprinciple in mind, let us scrutinize the evidence brought on record about identification.66. Firstly, we would like to appreciate the submission of the learned counsel as to whetheridentification of both the accused by 58 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt the "victim" was properidentification or not because they were identified by the "victim" in the Court from theirphotographs.67. The first information report would show that apart from penal provisions of the Indian PenalCode, the Investigation Officer also registered the offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012.Similarly, the charge was also framed against both the accused for the offence punishable underSection 6 of the POCSO Act. Clause(d) of Section 2 of the POCSO Act defines "child" and according to the said provision, the "child"means - "any person below the age of eighteen years."68. In the earlier part of this judgment, we have already dealt with the issue of age and has recordeda finding that the victim was a "child" under the provisions of the POCSO Act. The trial wasconducted in the Court of learned Special Judge, Buldhana as Special (POCSO) Case No. 27/2019.69. The POCSO Act was enacted to protect the children from the offence of sexual assault, sexualharassment and pornography 59 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt and provide for establishment of SpecialCourts for trial of such offences and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. ChapterV of the POCSO Act deals with the procedure for reporting of cases. Chapter VI of the said Act dealswith the procedure for recording the statement of the child ; and Chapter VIII of the Act deals withthe procedure and powers of the Special Courts of recording of evidence.70. Section 36 of the POCSO Act is reproduced hereunder :"Section 36 - Child not to see at the time of testifying -Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/24(1) The Special Court shall ensure that the Child is not exposed in any way to theaccused at the time of recording of the evidence, while at the same time ensuring thatthe accused is in a position to hear the statement of the child and communicate withhis advocate.(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the Special Court may record the statement ofa child through video conferencing or by utilizing single visibility mirrors or curtainsor any other device."Sub-section 1 of Section 36 mandates the Special Court that the said Court shall ensure that thechild is not exposed in any way to the accused at the time of recording of evidence, while at the 60CriConfCs01.20+2.odt same time ensuring that the accused is in a position to hear the statement ofthe child and communicate with his advocate. Sub- section 2 of Section 36 also permits the SpecialCourt to record statement of the child through video conferencing.71. In our view, in order to give complete meaning to sub- section 1 of Section 36 of the POCSO Act,the learned Special Judge was absolutely right in recording evidence of the "victim" in respect ofidentification of accused persons by allowing the learned prosecutor to show their photographs.Further it was never the case of any of the accused either during trial or even before this Court thatthe photographs of the accused were not shown to the victim. Even it was not their case eitherduring trial or even before this Court that the accused persons were not having opportunity to hearthe statement of the child i.e. "victim" and they were unable to communicate with their advocate inthat behalf. In view of this, we have no hesitation in our mind to reject the submission made by thelearned counsel that the identification of accused persons in the Court by the "victim" is vitiatedbecause they were identified by the "victim" through photographs.61 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt72. The submission of the learned counsel for the accused was that though "father" was knowingaccused no.2, his name was not disclosed in the first information report. In the first informationreport (Exh.19), it was stated by "father" that - "on 26.04.2019 at 10.00 O'clock in the night, aftertaking dinner when he along with his family were sleeping, at about 11.00 O'clock in the night, Sagar(accused No.1) along with one boy to whom he knows very well but not knowing his name, came onScooty." This particular assertion in the first information report itself is sufficient to discard thesubmission of the learned counsel in that behalf since the first informant himself has stated that hewas not knowing the name. If that be so, it is a very adventurous submission by the learned counselthat the informant did not disclose the name of accused no.2 though he was knowing him.73. Another submission of the learned counsel for the accused was that PW3 Shivaji was notknowing any of the accused and identity of accused no.1 was disclosed by one Prakash Sasane andstill Prakash Sasane was not examined. During cross- examination of PW3 Shivaji, it was brought onrecord that at the 62 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt time of recording of the evidence said Sasane waspassed away. In the cross-examination of PW3 Shivaji, it was brought on record that Prakash Sasanehad disclosed only name of accused no.1 to him.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/2574. PW3 Shivaji was a Security Guard at APMC market, Chikhli with Kashinath Appa Bondre. Hisevidence would show that he was knowing "father" of the "victim", who was also doing labour workat APMC. As per evidence of PW3 Shivaji, on 26.04.2019, his duty started at 9.00 p.m. and oneSasane was also doing security duty. His evidence would show that at 11.30 p.m., two persons cameon red Scooty. He stopped them and made enquiry as to why they were moving in the night. He alsotold them not to move in that area during night time and asked them to leave that area. That time,as per evidence of Shivaji, Shri Sasane disclosed that one of them was Sagar Borkar (accused no.1).Evidence of PW3 Shivaji further discloses that at about 1.00 p.m., he saw three persons travelling onsame Scooty, one was Sagar and another person's name he was not knowing and in between themthere was a girl, aged about 7-8 years and when he tried to stop them, they did not stop. Hisevidence further reveals that after some time, "father" of the girl came and 63 CriConfCs01.20+2.odtmade enquiry about his daughter. That time, as per the evidence of PW3 Shivaji, he disclosed to the"father" that his daughter was taken away on Scooty by two persons. From the witness box, he didstate that he can identify those two persons, who had taken away the girl. Relevant portion of theevidence is as under :"I can identify those two persons who have taken away the girl. Accused personsshown to me are same. Witness has pointed out his finger saying that, one is Sagar."75. According to the learned counsel for accused no.2, therefore, PW3 Shivaji has not identifiedaccused no.2 as he only pointed his finger towards Sagar.We are afraid to accept this submission of the learned counsel. Evidence of PW3 Shivaji would showthat another watchman Shri Sasane only disclosed the name of accused no.1 to him. If that be so, hehas rightly pointed out the finger by taking name of Sagar, but at the same time he did state and hedid identify accused no.2 also because he deposed that "accused persons shown to me are same."(emphasis supplied)76. From the cross-examination of PW3 Shivaji, it is brought 64 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt on recordthat even during night time villagers used to come with four wheelers and used to park their vehiclesin the ground. From the evidence of PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh, it is clear that APMC was under CCTVsurveillance. During the course of hearing, this aspect was not disputed.As per evidence of PW14 Gulabrao Wagh, seven CCTV cameras were fixed in APMC Market. Camerano.2 was covering area near Mahesh Traders and Camera no.10 was covering the area near maingate. CCTV footage was also seen by the Investigating Officer in presence of the panchas. Fixing ofseven cameras clearly show that in APMC area, there was no darkness. Therefore, PW3 Shivaji couldsee the faces of both the accused persons on two occasions, firstly at 11.30 pm when they wereroaming on red Scooty and they were stopped by this prosecution witness, made enquiry with themand asked them to leave the place, which portion was not at all challenged during hiscross-examination ; and secondly, at about 1.00 p.m. when he saw three persons travelling on sameScooty, one was Sagar and another person's name he was not knowing and in between them therewas a girl, aged about 7-8 years and when he tried to stop them, they did not stop. Therefore, 65CriConfCs01.20+2.odt though PW3 Shivaji was not knowing the name of accused no.2, he hadSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/26sufficient opportunity to watch the face of accused no.2 and only because he was not called in testidentification parade, his substantive evidence identifying accused no.2 cannot be discarded.Though, in the cross-examination, an attempt was made to seek his admission that he had not seenclearly the faces of the persons on Scooty, that does not mean that he had not seen the faces at all.Therefore, in our view, there was proper identification of accused no.2 by PW3 Shivaji from thewitness box.77. As per evidence of the "victim", when she was sleeping , she was lifted from her house. Though atthat time she was sleeping, her unchallenged evidence would show that she woke up when she wasmade to sit on Scooty. From APMC, she was taken about one kilometer away where rape wascommitted on her. So during this travel, there was sufficient opportunity for her to see and watchthe faces of both the accused persons. Of course, out of those two, she was knowing accused no.1 asit is clear that he was resident of very same area where victim's family used to reside.66 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt78. True it is that at the place of occurrence, there was no source of light, however, learnedAdditional Public Prosecutor with the assistance of the calender has pointed out rightly in our viewthat the intervening night of 26th and 27th April, 2019 on which the incident had occurred, was nota night of no moon. There is nothing on record to show that clouds were hovering in the sky andmoon was not visible. Further, both the accused committed rape on a small girl that postulates thattheir faces were very near to her and it is not that their faces were covered In our view, the little girlwill never forget the faces of the persons who subjected her to brutal rape and she will alwaysremember their faces forever. We have already seen the medical evidence, which shows how brutallyboth the accused persons have fulfilled their carnal lust. In our view, it will be really impossible forthe girl to forget the faces of those beasts. She identified accused no.2 not only in test identificationparade, but also from the witness box.79. The prosecution case cannot be faulted for not examining the panch witnesses during testidentification parade. The prosecution has examined Kunal Zalte (PW13), Naib Tahsildar, whoconducted test identification parade. Before conducting test 67 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt identificationparade, PW15 Dy.S.P. Mahamuni sought permission from learned Special Judge for holding andconducting test identification parade by giving request letter (Exh.109). It is dated 09.05.2019. On10.05.2019, the said was allowed. Accordingly, test identification parade was held on 15.06.2019, inwhich the victim identified accused no.2. It is to be mentioned here that except that theidentification parade was held after 50 days, the learned counsel for accused no.2 could not pointout any lacunae in the test identification parade.At the cost of repetition, we again point out that test identification parade is not a substantive pieceof evidence. Substantive piece of evidence is the identification of the accused by the witness fromwitness box and in this case, the "victim" has very firmly identified both the accused. If that be so,even if there is some lacunae in holding test identification parade, only on that, the important pieceof evidence of the victim identifying the culprit who committed rape on her, is not and cannot beallowed to be washed away. Therefore, we have no hesitation in our mind to reject the submissionsSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/27made on behalf of learned counsel for the accused persons about identification.68 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt80. In so far as Scooty is concerned, evidence of "father" (PW1) as well as PW3 Shivaji would showthat two persons came on the spot on Scooty. "Father" witnessed them in between 11.00 to 11.30p.m. as noticed by PW3 Shivaji, whereas at 1.00 O'clock in the night obviously PW3 Shivaji noticedboth the accused persons along with the victim in between them on Scooty.81. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that two wheeler Scooty was used forcarrying the victim from her place to the place of occurrence. PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh seized Scootybearing registration No. MH-28/AM-1298 under seizure panchanama (Exh.29). SeizurePanchanama (Exh.29) is duly proved by PW2 Subhash Bhalerao.After the investigation was handed over to PW15 Dy.S.P. Mahamuni, on 08.06.2019, he gave letter(Exh.114) to the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) for obtaining the documents of the Scooty.Accordingly, on 10.06.2019, he received the documents along with letter of the RTO (Exh.115),whereas the vehicle particulars are at Exh.116. Vehicle particulars (Exh.116) would show thataccused 69 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt no.2 Nikhil is the owner of two wheeler i.e. M-cycle/scooter.Further accused no.2 has not disputed that he is not the owner of the two wheeler, which iscommonly used by word "Scooty" by the prosecution witnesses. From the evidence of PW2, Scootywas seized from Pundlik Nagar. The charge as well as the memo of appeal filed by accused no.2Nikhil show the place of his residence as Pundlik Nagar. If that be so, merely because Mr. Gadekar,in front of whose house the Scooty was parked and seized, was not examined, is not sufficient todiscard the evidence of the prosecution regarding seizure and identification of the Scooty.E] VICTIM'S VERSION :82. "Victim" (PW4) was examined by the prosecution during trial. Rape was committed on her andaccording to the prosecution, the accused persons committed the same.83. From the evidence of the prosecution, it is clear that her date of birth is 27.01.2019, which is inconformity with Birth Certificate (Exh.55). Her evidence shows that she was taking education in aschool run by Municipal Council, Chikhli. The learned 70 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Judge before whomtrial was conducted found that the "victim" though minor, knows sanctity of oath. Therefore, oathwas administered to her. It is also seen from the record that in view of the provisions of the POCSOAct, her father was also present while recording her evidence.84. Her evidence would show that on the date of the incident, after taking dinner, she and herparents slept. When she was asleep, accused no.1 and according to the "victim's" version, one fat boycame and they lifted her and took away to the vehicle i.e. Scooty. She did state that when she waskept on Scooty, she woke up. She was kept in between them. Thereafter they took her near graveyard, where there was a cement ota. There they removed her clothes i.e. her pant, thereafter accusedno.1 Sagar and fat person also removed their pants, then accused no.1 inserted his urinary organSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr.

She also deposed that due to these acts of both the accused,her private part started bleeding. Also her stomach started aching. After fulfillment of their sexuallust, as per the "victim" both the 71 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt accused asked her to sit on Scooty andthen they dropped her near Mounibaba math, where she met with her parents.85. During trial, learned Prosecutor invited attention of the "victim" by showing the clothes to herwhich were on her person at the time of incident, which she identified as very same.86. The version of the "victim" that both the accused persons kept her in between them when theywere proceeding on Scooty from tin shed to the actual spot of incident, is duly corroborated by PW3Shivaji, who did state that at about 1.00 am he noticed three persons travelling on Scooty, one wasSagar (accused no.1) and one another person, whose name said witness was not knowing and inbetween them, there was a girl.87. The victim was knowing accused no.1 Sagar. From her cross-examination conducted by thelearned counsel for accused no.1, it was brought on record that she resides in Gorakshan wadi andaccused no.1 used to reside in other lane. During her cross- examination, a suggestion was given tothe "victim" that due to 72 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt darkness she was unable to state as to who hadtaken her to the cricket ground. Said suggestion was stoutly denied by the "victim". In the earlierpart of this judgment we have already discussed about the source of light.88. Suffice to say that from the suggestion given to her, it appears that there was no completedarkness in the APMC area.Though, the "victim" was not knowing by name accused no.2, during her cross-examination at thehands of learned counsel for accused no.2, she stated that :-"I have seen fat boy prior to the incident.".Nothing could be brought on record during her cross-examination that her evidence suffers fromimprovements and omissions when her police statement was recorded under Section 161 of the Codeof Criminal Procedure.89. After reading the notes of evidence of the "victim", at three places the learned Judge beforewhom the trial was conducted, has noted that the "victim" was weeping when the questions were putto her to suggest that she was lying. In fact at one place she 73 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt volunteered tothe Advocate conducting cross-examination for accused no.1 that he is lying. The demeanor of thewitness, especially the victim during the course of the trial, which was noted by the learned Judgehas its own importance.90. In this case, rape was committed on the girl in between 1.00 am to 2.00 a.m. at a secluded place.Therefore, nobody can expect that the act of the accused could be witnessed by anybody.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/2991. Evidence of the victim, in our view, is free from improvements. There is nothing on record toshow that the victim was having any motive to implicate any of the accused falsely. We are of theview that evidence of the victim is trustworthy and reliable. Further she suffered injuries on herprivate part which corroborates her version, though corroboration to the version of the "victim" inrape cases through medical evidence is not rule. Once it is found by Court that evidence of "victim"in rape cases is found to be trustworthy and it inspires confidence then the solitary evidence of such"victim" is sufficient to record conviction. In the present case, not only the evidence of "victim" isfound to be trustworthy, but 74 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt in addition to that it is proved that due to therape, she suffered life threatening injuries.F] SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE :-92. In this case, the prosecution is relying upon Chemical Analyser's reports as well as DNA reportto show complicity of both the accused in relation to the rape committed by them on "victim".93. Learned counsel for the accUsed submitted that for certain lacunae, DNA report (Exh.10) needsto be discarded. According to the learned counsel for the accused, prosecuting agency has failed toexamine the Assistant Chemical Analyser, who gave C.A. report as well as DNA report. To buttressthe said submission, the learned counsel relied upon the decision of Single Judge of this Court(Coram : V.M.Deshpande, J.) in Nagesh Samayya Made .vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in 2019All M.R. (Cri) 2224. So also, he relied upon the decision in Ganesh Laxman Madne .vs. State ofMaharashtra, reported in 2019 (5) Mh.L.J.(Cri) 314.94. In the earlier part of this judgment, we have already discussed that the victim was brought in theearly morning hours at 75 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Rural Hospital, Chikhli and she was examined byDr. Vijaya Kharpas (PW6) and her evidence is elaborately discussed.Evidence of Dr. Kharpas (PW6) would show that after examination of the victim, she obtained nailsamples, blood samples i.e. plain and EDTA, vaginal swab, urethral swab etc. Her unchallengedevidence shows that after obtaining samples, she sealed the samples and handed over it to a LadyPolice Constable, who was on duty. At the same time, she did state that she could not obtain pubichair sample of the "victim" because of its absence.Evidence of the victim also shows that the clothes of the victim were smeared with blood.95. PW14 PI Gulabrao Wagh was in-charge of the investigation from 27.04.2019 till it was handedover to Dy.S.P. Mahamuni (PW15) on 29.04.2019 as per the orders of the Superintendent of Police,Buldhana (Exh.95) because of invocation of the provisions of penal sections under the AtrocitiesAct. On 27.04.2019, as per the evidence of PW14 PI Wagh, Lady Police Constable brought samplesof the victim from hospital in sealed condition. Those were seized by him in presence of panchwitness 76 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Subhash Bhalerao (PW2). Seizure panchanama is at Exh.26.

Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/3096. Similarly, on very same date, the clothes of the "victim" were also seized in presence of PW2Bhalerao, which were produced by LPC. The clothes, consisting of full lower pant (Salwar) and top,were seized under seizure panchanama (Exh.25) and those were sealed. These clothes were dulyidentified as Article-A and Article-B by panch witness Subhash Bhalerao (PW2) from the witnessbox.From the cross-examination of PW14 PI Wagh and PW2 Bhalerao, it is clear that there was noserious challenge at all on the aspect of "sealing" of the clothes and samples of the "victim".97. PI Gulabrao Wagh (PW14) arrested accused no.1 Sagar Borkar on 27.04.2019 itself at about11.32 hours under arrest panchanama (Exh.79). After arrest, his clothes i.e. one white colour shirt,light blue colour jeans pant and light blue colour underwear having blood stains, were seized inpresence of panch witness Subhash Bhalerao (PW2). Those were seized under seizure memo(Exh.27).77 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt98. The Investigating Officer also sent accused no.1 Sagar to the Rural Hospital, Chikhli for hismedical examination by issuing communication dated 27.04.2019 (Exh.51) addressed to MedicalOfficer, Rural Hospital, Chikhli requesting him to conduct medical examination of accused no.1.Accordingly, Dr. Nutan Kale (PW8), who was discharging his duty at Rural Hospital, Chikhli on27.4.2019, conducted medical examination of accused no.1 when he was brought to him. Evidence ofDr. Kale (PW8) would show that before medical examination, he obtained consent of accused no.1.99. Evidence of Dr. Kale (PW8) would show that he collected blood samples, pubic hair sample, nailclipping and semen sample of accused no.1, as it could be seen from Exh.52. His evidence furthershows that after collection of the samples, he sealed it and handed over the same to the Constable.When those samples were brought in the police station, the Investigating Officer seized the sameunder seizure memo (Exh.28).100. Investigating Officer PI Wagh (PW14) arrested accused no.2 Nikhil under arrest memo(Exh.85) on 28.04.2019. After his arrest, he was also sent for medical examination at RuralHospital, 78 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Chikhli and he was examined by Dr. Sachin Kadam (PW5) on29.04.2019 when accused no.2 was brought to him with a letter (Exh.38) from the InvestigatingOfficer requesting him to conduct medical examination of accused no.2. Accordingly, PW5 Dr.Kadam examined accused no.2 and after examination, he collected samples of blood, pubic hair,nails and nail clippings, preferential swab, coronal swab and urotrol swab for chemical analysis andthose were sealed and handed over to the Police Constable on duty. He also identified from thewitness box accused no.2 as the same person, whose samples were taken by him. Similarly, clothesof accused no.2 were also seized under seizure panchanama (Exh.30) and under seizure memo(Exh.31). The samples collected and sealed by Dr. Kadam (PW5) were seized by the InvestigatingOfficer in presence of panch witness Subhash Bhalerao (PW2).Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/31101. Worth to mention here that from witness box, both, the Investigating Officer and panchwitness, have identified the clothes of accused nos.1 and 2 when those were shown to them.102. Muddemal was sent to the Regional Forensic Science 79 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Laboratory(RFSL), Amravati by Dy.S.P. Mahamuni (PW15) under letter (Exh.99) dated 02.05.2019. Exh.99shows an endorsement that those were received on 03.05.2019 in the said laboratory.103. The Chemical Analyser's reports are at Exh.135 collectively. It show that the samples and theclothes of the "victim" were registered as M.L. Case No. BAM-1310/19, in respect of accused no.1 itwas registered as M.L. Case No. BAM-1311/19, and in respect of accused no.2 it was registered asM.L. Case No. BAM- 1312/19.104. Perusal of C.A. reports (Exh.135) would show that the muddemal in respect of "victim" andboth the accused was received in sealed condition.105. Examination of M.L. Case No. BAM-1310/19 would show that blood group of the "victim" wasdetermined as "B". As per M.L. Case No. BAM-1311/1, blood group of accused no.1 Sagar wasdetermined as "A", whereas as per M.L. Case No. 1312/19, blood group of accused no.2 Nikhil wasdetermined as "AB".Ex.A1 and A2 were the clothes of the victim i.e. top and 80 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt full lower pant(stated to be salwar) ; Ex.B1 to B3 were the clothes of accused no.1 Sagar i.e. full shirt, full jeans pantand underwear ; and Exh.C1 to C3 were the clothes of accused no.2 Nikhil i.e. full jeans pant, fullT-shirt and underwear (torn).106. C.A. Report (Exh.135), which is available in this paper book running from page nos.130 to 131,would show that blood was detected on the clothes of the "victim". Similarly, underwear of accusedno.1 Sagar was also found to be stained with blood. So also, clothes of accused no.2 Nikhil i.e. fullpant, full T-shirt and underwear were found to be stained with blood. C.A. report shows that clothesof the "victim" were stained with blood of group 'B', obviously because of the fact that her bloodgroup was determined as "B". Though, on the clothes of the accused blood was found, as notedabove, its group could not be determined, however, importantly, the blood found on their clotheswas human blood.107. C.A. Report also shows that full lower pant (salwar) of the "victim" was having four semenstains, two semen stains each of about 1 cm in diameter on back middle portion, one semen stain of81 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt about 2 cm in diameter and one semen stain of 3 cm in diameter on frontright middle portion of the said Salwar. The Chemical Analyser found that said semen detected is ofhuman.108. C.A. Report (Exh.135) would further show that exhibits (1), (2) i.e. clothes of the victim andexhibits (5), (6), (7) and (8) i.e. clothes of accused no.1 Sagar and accused no.2 Nikhil, wereforwarded for DNA analysis as M.L.

From the interpretation, it is clear that DNA profile 83 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt obtained fromthe blood detected on top, full lower pant (salwar) of the "victim: and full T-shirt and underwear ofaccused no.2 was identical and from one and the same source of female origin and matched.Similarly, blood detected on underwear of accused no.1 Sagar matched with the DNA profileobtained and prepared from blood detected on Ex.1 Top of the "victim". So also it was found thatsemen on the cloths after DNA examination from the blood stain of accused no.2 Nikhil was hissemen.111. At this stage, it would be useful to note that, both C.A. examination as well as DNA examinationwere done by Dr. Santosh R. Kote, Assistant Chemical Analyser, RFSL, Amravati. In view of thisfact, the reliance placed on Nagesh Somayya Made's case (supra) is clearly distinguished on the factsitself because in that case, CA report and the DNA report were prepared by two different AssistantChemical Analysers. In that context and in view of other facts as appearing, the Court was of theview that in order to remove the ambiguity, examination of scientific expert ought to have been donethough it was not mandatory. Insofar as reliance placed on Ganesh 84 CriConfCs01.20+2.odtLaxman Madane's case (supra), the said case is of little help to the learned counsel because inparagraph 38 of the said report, it was specifically observed that though there is DNA report, thenicker of the victim was all the time exposed and therefore, contamination is not completely ruledout.In the present case, right from obtaining samples, their seizure and seizing of the clothes of the"victim" as well as both the accused persons, those were properly sealed. During the trial alsonothing could be brought on record by the defence that there was any chance of tampering with thesamples and the clothes of the "victim" as well as accused nos.1 & 2.112. DNA is predominant forensic technique for identifying criminals with the help of biologicaltissues. Importance and authenticity of DNA report is already well settled by the Hon'ble Apex Courtin the case of Mukesh and another .vs. State , reported at 2019(2) Mh.L.J. (Cri.)(SC) 52. In thisauthoritative pronouncement, the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that -"From the aforesaid authorities, it is quite clear that DNA report deserves to beaccepted unless it is absolutely dented and for non-85 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt acceptance of the same, it is to be established that therehad been no quality control or quality assurance. If the sampling is proper and ifthere is no evidence as to tampering of the samples, the DNA test report is to beaccepted."113. In absence of any contrary, we have no hesitation in our mind to record a finding that theprosecution has proved about the quality control and quality assurance in respect of examination ofsamples. We are of the view, which can be deduced from the available evidence itself that the clothesSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/34and samples of the victim as well as both the accused persons were properly sealed and those werenot tampered at any point of time. In our view, therefore, the learned Special Judge, before whomthe trial was conducted, has rightly accepted both C.A. report and DNA report.114. It would be useful to make a reference here that during the course of submissions, both thelearned counsel for the accused pointed out that though CA report and DNA report were used by thelearned Special Judge while holding the accused guilty and awarding punishment, specific questionsin that behalf were not put to them when they were examined under Section 313 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure and thus an opportunity was not given to them to offer 86CriConfCs01.20+2.odt their explanation. They submitted that the questions were put to themgenerally. Even the learned Additional Public Prosecutor Mr. Doifode fairly submitted that thespecific questions were not put to them.115. The question whether at the appellate stage incriminating material can be brought to the noticeof the convicts in order to give them an opportunity to offer their explanation is not in res integra inview of the authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Nar Singh .vs. State ofHaryana , reported in (2015) 1 SCC 496 and more specifically it is settled in paragraph 23 of the saidjudgment. Paragraph 23 from the said report is reproduced herein below :"23. When such objection as to omission to put the question under Section 313 CrPCis raised by the accused in the appellate court and prejudice is also shown to havebeen caused to the accused, then what are the courses available to the appellate Court? The appellate court may examine the convict or call upon the counsel for theaccused to show that what explanation the accused has as regards the circumstancesestablished against him but not put to him under Section 313 CrPC and the saidanswer can be taken into consideration."87 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt116. In view of this authoritative pronouncement, on 05.8.2021, this Court proposedto examine both the accused persons under Section 313 of the Code of CriminalProcedure by recording their further statement in order to given them an opportunityto offer explanation, if they wish, to the incriminating evidence used against them intrial.117. Both the accused persons used to be brought before this Court right from the first day of hearingfrom jail custody, it being the confirmation of their death sentence. On 05.8.2021, in presence oftheir respective counsel, this Court brought to the notice of both the accused the incriminatingevidence appearing against them in C.A. report (Exh.135) and DNA report (Exh.10) by putting themquestions in 'Marathi'. This Court also gave an understanding to them that it is not compulsory onthem to answer the questions in a particular fashion or manner.118. Neither of the accused offered any explanation to the question put to them. On the contrary,their replies were that the CA report (Exh.135) and DNA report (Exh.10) are false. Their 88Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/35CriConfCs01.20+2.odt vernacular answers were taken in the handwriting of one of us and both theaccused replied only "[kksVs vkgs-" Thus, though an opportunity was given to both of them, they didnot offer any explanation, but state that everything is false.119. In our view, oral evidence of the "victim", which is otherwise also found to be trustworthy andinspiring confidence about the sexual assault made on her by to the accused, found corroborationfrom the scientific evidence i.e. CA report (Exh.135) and DNA report (Exh.10) and therefore, we arerecording finding to that effect accordingly.G] ADMISSIBILITY OF ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE :-120. Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, 1872 deal with the admissibility and contents ofevidence of information contained in electronic records. The Apex Court in the case of Anwar P. V.vs P. K. Basheer, reported in (2014) 10 SCC 473 has held that these two sections are a complete Codein themselves on the admissibility of evidence of information contained in electronic records.89 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt121. Section 65B(1) differentiates between -i) the "original document" - the electronic record on the device in which the originalinformation is first stored (qualifying it as primary evidence), andii) the output from such device which contains information originating from theoriginal document, i.e. a copy made therefrom (being secondary evidence) [ArjunPanditrao Khotkar vs Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal, (2020) 7 SCC 1].122. The Hon'ble Apex Court has in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar (supra), in para 73.2, expounded thelaw on admissibility of primary and secondary evidence in electronic form in the following words-"73.2. The clarification referred to above is that the required certificate under Section65B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced. This can be done bythe owner of a laptop computer, computer tablet or even a mobile phone, by steppinginto the witness box and proving that the concerned device, on which the originalinformation is first stored, is owned and/or operated by him. In cases where the"computer" happens to be a part of a "computer system" or "computer network" andit becomes impossible to physically bring such system or network to the Court, thenthe only means of providing information contained in such electronic record can bein accordance with Section 65B(1), together with the requisite certificate underSection 65B(4). The last sentence in Anvar P.V. (supra) which reads as "...if anelectronic record as such is used as primary evidence under Section 62 90CriConfCs01.20+2.odt of the Evidence Act..." is thus clarified; it is to be read withoutthe words "under Section 62 of the Evidence Act..." With this clarification, the lawstated in paragraph 24 of Anvar P.V. (supra) does not need to be revisited."Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/36[Emphasis supplied]123. It is necessary to note that the Hon'ble Apex Court in Anwar P. V. (supra) hasclarified its position on primary evidence holding that if an electronic record is usedas primary evidence under Section 62 of the Evidence Act, it may be admissible inevidence without any compliance of conditions under S. 65B. Arjun PanditraoKhotkar (supra) held this position to be good law when read without the words,"under Section 62 of the Evidence Act" , while placing its derivation in S.65B(1). TheHon'ble Apex Court held that the certificate under S. 65B(4) is unnecessary if the"original document"itself is produced, since it is being used as primary evidence of the information contained in theelectronic record. This can be done by the owner of the device (on which the original electronicrecord is first stored) by proving that it is owned and/or operated by him.124. Commonly, the original electronic record of a CCTV footage is stored on a memorychip/CD/DVD/hard drive or any 91 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt similar device on a computer, DVR orNVR wherein the footage is recorded. The original electronic record stored on a memorychip/CD/DVD/hard drive, being the place where the electronic record is first stored, is said to be theoriginal document, qualifying it as primary evidence. Such information can be led as evidence byproducing the hard drive, wherein the original document is first stored, before the Court. In order toprove the information contained in such electronic record, the memory chip/CD/DVD/hard driveon which the electronic record was first stored can be produced before the Court. Similarly, in caseswhere the device happens to be a part of a "computer system" or "computer network", such systemor network or server can be produced before the Court, if it is possible. In case where the devicehappens to be a part of a "computer system" or "computer network" and it becomes impossible tophysically bring such system or network to the Court, then the only means of proving informationcontained therein can be, as specified above is, "in accordance with Section 65B(1), together with therequisite certificate under Section 65B(4)."125. The prosecution has relied upon the CCTV footage from 92 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt camera no. 2covering the area of the main gate of the office of APMC Market, Chikhli. The prosecution hasexamined PI Gulabrao Wagh (PW14) and Dy.S.P. Baburao Mahamuni (PW15) in order to prove thesaid CCTV footage. From the evidence of Dy.S.P. Mahamuni (PW15), it appears that the prosecutionhas brought on record the CCTV footage copied in pendrive (Article-M). It is stated by Dy.S.P.Mahamuni (PW15), that its Hash value was taken by NPC Sharad Giri and accordingly certificateunder Section 65B of the Evidence Act (Exhibit 112) was taken. Though evidence of PI Wagh (PW14)and Dy.S.P. Mahamuni (PW15) has been corroborated by panch witness Subhash Bhalerao (PW2)regarding CCTV footage, it appears that the prosecution has failed to adduce evidence of a personoccupying responsible official position in relation to the operation or the management of theactivities in relation to CCTV in the APMC Market, Chikhli. Since the prosecution has failed to bringon record the primary evidence in relation to CCTV footage in the form of hard disc of the said CCTVfootage wherein the footage was stored, it was necessary for the prosecution to satisfy theingredients of Sub-Section (4) of Section 65B of the Evidence Act. Merely because the CCTV footageSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/37has been exhibited by the trial Court and no objection was 93 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt raised onbehalf of the accused, the CCTV footage cannot be read in evidence. The said issue is no longerres-integra in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar (supra).We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that in absence of compliance of Sub-Section (4) ofSection 65B of the Evidence Act, the CCTV footage from camera no.2 covering the area of main gateof the office of APMC Market, Chikhli cannot be relied upon as admissible evidence of theprosecution.126. In addition to the evidence of CCTV footage, the prosecution sought to rely upon SDR, CDR andtower location of the accused. Mahamuni (PW15) has stated in his evidence that as per his letterissued to Superintendent of Police, Buldhana, he received four papers which were marked as Exh.125. He stated in his evidence that from CDR and SDR, he came to know about the location of theaccused at the time of incident. He identified the contents of the said letter which were marked asExhs. 126 and 127. Learned trial Court refused to place reliance upon SDR, CDR and tower locationof the accused as the said electronic evidence were not supported by certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. In our opinion, 94 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt the learned trial Court has rightlyrefused to rely upon the electronic evidence placed on record by the prosecution in the form of CCTVfootage, CDR, SDR and tower location of the accused for non- compliance of Section 65B (4) of theEvidence Act.H] FINDINGS :-127. In the preceding paragraphs in the body of this judgment, we have elaborately not onlydiscussed the prosecution case, but also evaluated the same. We have also considered variousdefences raised by the learned counsel for both the accused not only during trial but also before us.128. On re-appreciation of entire prosecution case, we reached to the conclusion independently thatthe learned Judge before whom trial was conducted has rightly convicted both the accused underSection 363 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code inasmuch as both the accused personshad removed the victim, a minor girl from the lawful guardianship of her parents and without theirconsent, one of whom i.e. "father" was examined during trial.We have elaborately discussed the evidence of four Doctors, who examined the victim at threedifferent places i.e. Rural 95 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Hospital, Chikhli, Civil Hospital, Buldhana andGovernment Medical College, Aurangabad which is also known as Ghati Hospital commonly. Underhead "Medical Evidence", we have discussed in detail the evidence of each of the Doctors, whounequivocally stated that the minor girl (victim) suffered as many as six injuries on her private part.Not only that, she was required to be removed from Chikhli to Buldhana and from Buldhana toAurangabad for her proper health management. Evidence also shows that at private part stitcheswere applied at Buldhana and ultimately she was required to be operated upon at Aurangabad.129. Evidence of the "victim" according to us is trustworthy. It inspires confidence in our mindabout the sexual atrocities committed on her. We have no hesitation in our mind to record ourfinding that both the accused persons are responsible for committing rape on her. We firmly acceptSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/38and believe the testimony of the victim in view of she identifying accused no.2 Nikhil during thecourse of investigation i.e. test identification parade. We also fully accept the evidence of the victimas trustworthy regarding she identifying both the accused from the witness box during hersubstantive evidence.96 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Therefore, there is no iota of doubt in our mind that both the accusedhave committed offence punishable under Section 376(2)(m) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.130. The victim had given her date of birth when she was examined in the Court as 27.01.2009. Theprosecution has also independently proved the said date of birth through PW9 Raju Deshmukh, whoproved birth certificate (Exh.55) of the "victim" to show that her date of birth is 27.01.2009. Theincident in question is dated 27.04.2019. Thus, on the date of the incident, her age was 10 years and3 months. Section 376-DB deals with the punishment for gang rape on a woman under 12 years ofage. Since, it is proved that at the time of occurrence, age of the victim was below 12 years, surely theaccused persons who were two in numbers will be liable for punishment under Section 376-DB andthe learned Special Judge has rightly convicted them and we affirm their conviction. We also affirmthe conviction recorded by the learned Special Judge for the offence punisahble under Sec. 506 readwith Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code considering the evidence of the victim that threats wereextended to her by both the accused after committing rape on her.97 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt131. Only accused No.2 Nikhil was convicted for the penal provisions under the Atrocities Act i.e.Section 3(1)(w)(1) and 3(1) (w)(ii). A plain reading of said penal provisions show that accused mustknow that the woman belong to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. He is also convicted for theoffence punishable under Section 3(2)(v) of the Atrocities Act.These two penal provisions show that at the time of commission of the offence, the accused musthave knowledge that the victim belongs to either Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe and in spite ofthe knowledge, he commits the acts which are punishable.132. As per the Caste Certificate (Exh.21) of the victim, she belong to the caste which is a ScheduledCaste. Similarly, it is proved on record that accused no.2 is not belonging to Scheduled Caste.Accused no.1 was belonging to Scheduled Caste.133. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence of the "victim" as well as "father", there is noting onrecord to show that accused no.2 was knowing and/or having knowledge that family of the victimbelong to Scheduled Caste. Even learned Additional Public 98 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt Prosecutor forthe State could not point out to us that aspect. If that be so, we are of the view that the learnedSpecial Judge ought not to have convicted accused no.2 Nikhil for the penal provisions under theAtrocities Act.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/39I] PUNISHMENT :-134. The learned Judge of the trial Court imposed various punishments. Though, the learned Judgehas convicted both the accused for the offence punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act, boththe accused were sentenced under Section 376-DB read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Codeand imposed death punishment. In view of imposition of death penalty, the learned Judge made areference to this Court for its confirmation.135. Section 376-DB of the IPC reads as under :"376-DB - Punishment for gang rape on woman under twelve years of age :-Where a woman under twelve years of age is raped by one or more personsconstituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of thosepersons shall be deemed to have committed the offence of rape and shall be punishedwith imprisonment for life, which shall mean 99 CriConfCs01.20+2.odtimprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and with fine, or withdeath: Provided that such fine shall be just and reasonable to meet the medicalexpenses and rehabilitation of the victim:Provided further that any fine imposed under this section shall be paid to the victim."136. Plain reading of this Section would show that after being found guilty for committing gang rapeon a woman under twelve years of age, the punishment is provided i.e. imprisonment for life whichshall mean imprisonment for remainder of that person's natural life and with fine or with death.Thus, it is clear that death sentence is not the only punishment provided for the offence punishableunder Section 376- DB of IPC.137. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh .vs. State of Punjab ,reported in (1980) 2 SCC 684 in paragraph 202 has ruled as under :"202. Drawing upon the penal statutes of the States in U.S.A. framed after Furman v,Georgia, in general, and Clauses 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Indian Penal Code(Amendment) Bill passed in 100 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt 1978 by the Rajya Sabha, inparticular, Dr. Chitale has suggested these "aggravating circumstances": Aggravatingcircumstances : A Court may, however, in the following cases impose the penalty ofdeath in its discretion:(a) if the murder has been committed after previous planning and involves extremebrutality; or(b) if the murder involves exceptional depravity; orSagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/40(c) if the murder is of a member of any of the armed forces of the Union or of amember of any police force or of any public servant and was committed -(i) while such member or public servant was on duty; or(ii) in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such member orpublic servant in the lawful discharge of his duty as such member or public servantwhether at the time of murder he was such member or public servant, as the casemay be, or had ceased to be such member or public servant; or(d) if the murder is of a person who had acted in the lawful discharge of his dutyunder Section 43 of the CrPC, 1973, or who had rendered assistance to a Magistrateor a police officer demanding his aid or requiring his assistance under Section 37 andSection 129 of the said Code."Similarly, paragraph 206 of the said report reads as under :"206. Dr. Chitaley has suggested these mitigating factors:Mitigating circumstances:- In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases, theCourt shall take 101 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt into account the following circumstances:(1) That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental oremotional disturbance.(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he shall not be sentenced todeath. (3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts ofviolence as would constitute a continuing threat to society. (4) The probability thatthe accused can be reformed and rehabilitated.The State shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions 3and 4 above.(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he wasmorally justified in committing the offence.(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person.(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and thatthe said defect unpaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct."138. In this case, from the Roznama it is clear that on 11.08.2020. the learned Special Judge foundboth the accused guilty of serious offences and therefore, the Court found it necessary to hearlearned Prosecutor and the learned Advocate for the accused in view of the mandate of Section 235of the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore, the judgment was suspended to hear the 102Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/41CriConfCs01.20+2.odt accused persons on the point of sentence. Roznama of the said trial wouldshow that the case was then posted on 13.08.2020. In paragraph 132 of the judgment delivered bythe learned Special Judge, it is mentioned that accused no.1 said nothing on the point of sentence,whereas accused no.2 prayed for minimum sentence. Learned Advocate for accused no.1 made asubmission before trial Court that accused no.1 is married having small daughter as well as his sickmother.139. The learned Special Judge, after considering the plea of both the accused and considering thesubmission of the learned learned Prosecutor, imposed the extreme penalty of death, of course, bygiving reasons.140. In paragraph 206 of Bachan Singh's case (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down that itis for the State to adduce evidence to prove that the case does not satisfy condition nos.3 and4. In the present case, no such evidence was adduced on behalf of the State.141. In one of the recent decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court 103 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt in Dattatray@ Datta Ambo Rokade .vs. State of Maharashtra , reported in 2020 All M.R. (Cri.) 36 (SC), theHon'ble Apex Court has taken survey of this issue by considering various decisions including BachanSingh .vs. State of Punjab (supra) ; Macchi Singh and others .vs. State of Punjab [(1983) 3 SCC 470]etc. It would be useful to reproduce herein below relevant paragraph of the Judgment inDattatraya's case (supra)."100. In Rajesh Kumar vs. State (through Govt. of NCT of Delhi), (2011) 13 SCC 706 :[2011 ALL SCR 2670] this Court observed:-"83. The ratio in Bachan Singh has received approval by the international legalcommunity and has been very favourably referred to by David Pannick in JudicialReview of the Death Penalty: Duckworth (see pp. 104-05). Roger Hood and CarolynHoyle in their treatise on The Death Penalty, 4th Edn. (Oxford) have also very muchappreciated the Bachan Singh ratio (see p. 285). The concept of "rarest of rare" whichhas been evolved in Bachan Singh by this Court is also the internationally acceptedstandard in cases of death penalty.84. Reference in this connection may also be made to the right based approach inexercising discretion in death penalty as suggested by Edward Fitzgerald, the BritishBarrister. [Edward Fitzgerald: The Mitigating Exercise in Capital Cases in DeathPenalty Conference (3-5 June), Barbados: Conference Papers andRecommendations.] It has been suggested therein that right approach towardsexercising discretion in capital cases is to start from a strong presumption against thedeath penalty. It is argued that "the presence of any significant mitigating 104CriConfCs01.20+2.odt factor justifies exemption from the death penalty even in themost gruesome cases" and Fitzgerald argues:Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr. Pso Ps ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173322176/42"Such a restrictive approach can be summarised as follows: The normal sentenceshould be life imprisonment. The death sentence should only be imposed instead ofthe life sentence in the 'rarest of rare' cases where the crime or crimes are ofexceptional heinousness and the individual has no significant mitigation and isconsidered beyond reformation."(Quoted in The Death Penalty, Roger Hood and Hoyle, 4th Edna., Oxford, p. 285.)86. Taking an overall view of the facts in these appeals and for the reasons discussedabove, we hold that death sentence cannot be inflicted on the appellant since thedictum of the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh is that the legislative policy inSection 354 (3) of the 1973 Code is that for a person convicted of murder, lifeimprisonment is the rule and death sentence, an exception, and the mitigatingcircumstances must be given due consideration. Bachan Singh further mandates thatin considering the question of sentence the court must show a real and abidingconcern for the dignity of human life which must postulate resistance to taking lifethrough law's instrumentality. Except in the "rarest of rare cases" and for "specialreasons" death sentence cannot be imposed as an alternative option to the impositionof life sentence".142. On going through this, Hon'ble Apex Court has ruled that Bachan Singh (supra)mandates that in considering the question of sentence the court must show a real andabiding concern for the dignity of human life which must postulate resistance totaking life through law's instrumentality. (emphasis supplied).105 CriConfCs01.20+2.odt143. We are of the opinion that in view of the aforesaid law laid down by the Hon'bleApex Court death sentence is not the only penalty for the offence under Section376(DB) of IPC. The law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court states that onprevious occasion also the accused must be convicted for the heinous offence, whichis not the present case. Further, as we have already noted that no evidence isrecorded by the State to show that the accused persons are menace to the society, wefind ourselves disagreeing with the said punishment imposed by the learned SpecialJudge. The conspectus of all the discussion in this judgment, allows us to pass thefollowing order :ORDER1. Reference made by the learned Special Judge, Buldhana for confirmation of deathsentence of accused No.1 - Sagar Vishwanath Borkar and accused no.2 Nikhil ShivajiGolait for the offence punishable under Section 376DB read with Section 34 of theIndian Penal Code, as awarded to them in Special POCSO Case No. 27 of 2019,decided on 13.08.2020, is answered in negative.Sagar Vishwanath Borkar vs State Of Maharashtra Thr.
