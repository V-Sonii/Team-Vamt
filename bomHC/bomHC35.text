Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) guidelines with regard to the carrying/lifting of differently abled person – Guidelines regarding ‘Carriage by Air of Persons with Disability and/or Persons with Reduced Mobility’ – Directions.No differently abled person should be manually lifted without his consent. We find that the suggestion is worth considering, as lifting of a person manually is inhumane. How, the differently abled person should be treated with dignity is left to the DGCA.Some of the differently abled person use prosthetic limbs/calipers. Some time, they are directed to remove their prosthetic limbs/calipers as a part of the security check. In the draft guidelines circulated, it has been mentioned that scanning of prosthetic limbs/calipers though full body scanner but to what extent differently abled persons with prosthetic limbs/calipers are required to be checked for the purpose of security should be in a manner where, no such person is asked to remove prosthetic limbs/calipers to maintain human dignity while ensuring the requirement of security checks.The present writ petition was filed by petitioner no. 1- who is suffering from cerebral palsy along with petitioner no. 2 (Abled, Differently Abled, All People Together, formerly known as the Spastics Society of India).
