The Appellant was having a shop for recharging of mobile phones. Thedeceased used to come to his shop for recharging her phone. Slowly their friendship grew into loveaffair. Earlier both of them had eloped together. On that occasion they had returned. But again thedeceased left her house. The deceased was residing at Kongaon, Taluka Panvel, District Raigad. TheAppellant used to visit her. There was a quarrel between them on 03/10/2012 in the evening. On thenext date on 04/10/2012 at about 04.30 p.m. 3 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt there was again quarrelbetween them and on this occasion, the Appellant committed her murder by throttling her. Theneighbours had reached the room, where the murder was committed, on hearing noise. They sawthe Appellant jumping out of the window and running away. The deceased was lying dead. Thereforethe landlord Janardan Gharat lodged his FIR. The investigation was conducted and the Appellantwas arrested on 05/10/2012. After completion of the investigation, the charge-sheet was filed andthe case was committed to the Court of Sessions. At the conclusion of the trial the Appellant wasconvicted and sentenced as mentioned earlier.4. During trial the prosecution examined in all 10 witnesses;P.W.1 - Janardan Janu Gharat and P.W.3 Harish Tejab Shetty, had seen the Appellant jumping outof the window and running away after commission of crime. P.W.2 - Faik Nijam Patel, had seen theAppellant going away towards high way in a frightened condition at about 04.30 p.m. on04/10/2012.4 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt P.W.4 - Deepak Sarkar, is the father of the deceased and he has givenhistory of relationship between the Appellant and the deceased.P.W.5 - Dr. Basavraj Sangnath Lohare, had conducted the post-mortem examination.P.W.6 - Jayavanti Janardhan Gharat was Pancha for Inquest Panchanama.P.W.7 - Ashok Narayan Patil, was a Pancha for recovery of clothes of the Appellant.P.W.8 - Vinayak Ramchandra Patil, was a Pancha for Spot Panchanama.P.W.9 - Jagdish Namdeo Patil, was a Pancha for arrest of the Appellant.P.W.10 - PI Adhikrao Mahadeo Pol, was the Investigating Officer.The prosecution has also produced C.A. certificates on record.5. The defence of the Appellant was of total denial. He has not taken any specific defence.6. Learned counsel Mr.Aniket Vagal submitted that the incident is a result of sudden quarrel and inthe heat of passion the Appellant has committed this act. His subsequent conduct 5 / 19APPEAL-344-15.odt and his repentance of the act before P.W.3 saying that he had committed amistake; shows that he had not intended to commit murder of the deceased.Sameer Khan Alias Vasim Azgar ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169052203/27. Mr.Vagal emphasized on his submissions that this is not a case of murder, but the offence is oflesser degree and it falls within the exceptions mentioned in section 300 of the IPC defining murder.8. On the other hand, learned APP Mr. S. S. Hulke submitted that the prosecution has proved all thenecessary facts. The prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was a case of homicideand the Appellant had committed this crime.9. According to the learned APP, if the Appellant was taking up a defence that the offene was a lesserdegree, it was for him to prove that his act fell in one of the exceptions mentioned in section 300 ofthe IPC. In this case the Appellant has failed to discharge his burden. The Appellant cannot take 6 /19 APPEAL-344-15.odt advantage of the prosecution evidence on record in this case to discharge theburden. There is nothing to support the theory that the incident had taken place in a sudden quarreland the Appellant has not taken any undue advantage or has not acted in a cruel manner. LearnedAPP therefore submits that the offence squarely fell within the meaning of murder as defined u/s300 of the IPC.10. We have considered these submissions.P.W.5 Dr. Basavraj Lohare had conducted the post- mortem examination. He had found followinginjuries;A) Finger nail marks (crescentic)(curve shape of nail) mark abrasions on the front ofneck ((S) shape) 0.5 cm in length each.B) Irregularly distributed finger marks (Bruises) over anterior aspect of neck,multiple 3 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm and 2 cm.C) Bruises on right side neck 4 cm x 2 cm diffused swelling noted.D) Bruises on left side of neck 3.5 cm x 2 cm. E) Fracture hyoid bone noted.7 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt11. According to him the cause of death was 'asphyxia due to throttling'. He has statedthat the deceased had died because of the compression of trachea. There was nocross-examination of this witness. The evidence of this witness leaves no manner ofdoubt to conclude that the deceased had died because of throttling.12. As far as complicity of the Appellant is concerned, the prosecution has relied on the evidence ofP.W.1 and P.W.3. The P.W.1 was the landlord in whose room the deceased was residing. It wasRoom No.2, on the second floor. He has stated that the Appellant used to meet the deceased. He hasidentified the Appellant before the Court. He has further deposed that on 03/10/2012, he had seenthe deceased and the Appellant going to the market. That time P.W.1 had enquired with thedeceased about the Appellant. The deceased had told him that he was her husband. After theySameer Khan Alias Vasim Azgar ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169052203/3returned home, there was a quarrel between the deceased and the Appellant. P.W.1 went there. Afterthe 8 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt quarrel had stopped, he came back. On 04/10/2012 at about 04.30p.m. when he was in his house, again he heard the quarrel between the Appellant and the deceased.He went to the room. He called them, but they did not respond. P.W.1 then came down and got fourmore persons with him, as he suspected some serious problem. All of them again went to the roomNo.2. They pushed the door. It is his case that he saw the Appellant running away through thewindow of that room. The window was near the kitchen. It was not having any grill. The P.W.1 askedthe Appellant to stop, but he did not stop and ran away. All of them entered the room. They saw thatthe deceased was lying on the bed. She was not responding. There was no movement. P.W.1 couldsee the signs of throttling and marks on the throat. According to him, the deceased was lying deadthere. P.W.1 then went to the police station and lodged his FIR against the Appellant. The FIR isproduced on record at Ex.17. He showed the spot to the police. He identified the Appellant's clotheswhen produced during the trial. In his cross-examination he has stated that the height of each floorwas 12 ft. They knocked on the 9 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt door for about 5 minutes. There was somecontradictions in his FIR and deposition before the Court as to whether he had seen the Appellantand the deceased going to the market on the previous day of the incident or about 8 days prior to theincident. In our opinion these contradictions do not go to the root of the case. Beyond this, nothingmuch was elicited from his cross-examination. The record shows that the FIR was lodgedimmediately at about 06.15 p.m. at New Panvel police station.13. P.W.3 Harish Tejab Shetty was residing in the same building on the first floor. He was knowingthe deceased as well as the Appellant. According to him, he had seen the Appellant on one or twooccasions, while the Appellant was going to the room of the deceased. The Appellant was native ofZarkhand and whenever he went to Zarkhand he used to call the deceased telephonically and sometimes if her phone was not reachable, he used to call this witness. He has stated that, on03/10/2012, he had heard quarrel between the Appellant and the deceased at about 07.00 p.m. On04/10/2012, when he was in the house, at 10 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt about 4 to 4.30 p.m., heheard shouts from the deceased. He went there. P.W.1 and his son were present there. The door wasshut from inside. All of them opened the door with some force. P.W.3 has stated that he had seen theAppellant running from the window of the room. They asked him to stop, but he did not stop. Hewas wearing a blue coloured T shirt. They saw that the deceased was lying on the ground. Therewere signs of throttling. P.W.1 then called the police. The police came there and made enquiries.P.W.3 gave phone number of the Appellant to the police. P.W.3 was taken to Pune as the location ofthe Appellant's phone was showing that he was in Pune. After some time, the location was shown atLonawala and then at Panvel. P.W.3 was taken to Panvel. During that time, P.W.3 received a phonecall from the Appellant. It is his case that the Appellant said that he had committed a mistake. Onthe instructions of the police P.W.3 told the Appellant that the deceased was still alive and was inthe hospital. The Appellant came to the S.T. stand at Panvel. The police arrested him there. In thecross-examination, P.W.3 has accepted that his statement was recorded on 11 / 19APPEAL-344-15.odt 12/10/2012. The deceased had started residing in that building since onemonth prior to the incident. According to him, the Appellant was staying with her. He wasconfronted with some omissions from his police statement. He could not explain as to why thoseomissions occurred. The police statement did not mention that he had heard shouts from Deepti. Inthe police statement it was not mentioned that the Appellant had called him and had admitted to hisSameer Khan Alias Vasim Azgar ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169052203/4mistake and that the police had instructed the P.W.3 to tell the Appellant that the deceased was stillalive.14. P.W.2 Faik Nijam Patel is another witness examined by the prosecution to show the Appellant'spresence near the spot. He had stated that on 04/10/2012 at about 04.30 p.m. he had seen a boywearing blue coloured T shirt and having sack on his back going towards high way in a frightenedcondition. This witness had seen the deceased with that boy on some occasions. The deceased andthe Appellant had come to his shop on one or two occasions. But this witness did not know theAppellant's 12 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt name. On 08/10/2012, P.W.2 was called to the policestation and there he identified the Appellant as the boy who was accompanying the deceased. Hecould not explain as to why his police statement did not mention that the Appellant and thedeceased had come to his shop in the past.15. P.W.4 Deepak Sarkar is the father of the deceased. He has deposed as to how the Appellant andthe deceased got acquainted. He has stated that both of them had eloped in the past, but they wereapprehended by the police. That incident had taken place in January 2011. In the same year 2011 thedeceased left their house under some pretext. He called the Appellant to make enquiries, but theAppellant gave evasive replies. On 04/10/2012 the deceased made a telephonic call and told thiswitness's wife i.e. mother of the deceased that she was going to marry a boy by name Rajesh and wasnot planning to marry the Applicant. She also informed that the Appellant used to come to her fortaking money. She further told that on that day also the Appellant was to come for taking money.This 13 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt conversation had taken place at about 01.30 p.m. His cross-examination does not reveal anything of significance.16. Consideration of this evidence shows that P.W.1 and P.W.3 are important witnesses. Theprosecution case rests on their evidence. Both have consistently deposed that at the time of theincident they and others had gone to the room of the deceased. They had opened the door withforce. They had seen the Appellant jumping out of the window and then running away. The deceasedwas lying dead in that room. There were signs of throttling. All this is consistently deposed. There isno serious challenge to this evidence. There are some omissions from the police statement of P.W.3.His statement is also recorded a little belatedly. However, P.W.1's evidence does not suffer from anyinfirmity. He is a natural witness. He was residing on the ground floor. He had deposed about thequarrel that had taken place in the previous evening and also about the incident on 04/10/2012. TheFIR is lodged immediately at 06.15 p.m. on 04/10/2012. There was no reason for him to 14 / 19APPEAL-344-15.odt concoct a false story. There was no enmity between this witness and theAppellant. This witness had regularly seen the Appellant with the deceased.17. P.W.2 also gives some corroboration to evidence of these two witnesses. He had not gone to thespot of incident, but he had seen the Appellant going towards high way in a frightened condition. Hehas identified the Appellant in the police station. The Investigating Officer could have takenprecaution to conduct the identification parade for P.W.2 to enable him to identify the Appellant.But in any case his evidence is not the main evidence in this case. The incriminating evidence is thatof P.W.1 and P.W.3 and in particularly that of P.W.1. Father of the deceased has given a historybetween the couple. Significantly he has deposed that on the date of incident the deceased had calledSameer Khan Alias Vasim Azgar ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169052203/5them and had expressed her desire not to marry the Appellant, but to marry some other person. Theevidence of this witness is not seriously challenged by the defence.15 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt18. Though, the CA report does not exactly help the prosecution case, the Spot Panchanama andother investigation carried out, does support the evidence of these main witnesses.19. The Appellant has not offered any explanation whatsoever. The prosecution has definitelyproved its case that the Appellant was inside the room when the incident had taken place and whenthe witnesses entered the room, he ran away by jumping from the window. The deceased was lyingdead. It was incumbent upon the Appellant to explain the situation which was within his exclusiveknowledge as per the requirement of section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act. Apart from that, asclaimed by Mr.Vagal, if his case fell within any of the exceptions to the definition of murder u/s 300of IPC, it was for the Appellant to have discharged his burden to prove that his case fell in any of theexceptions. In this case either on his own or on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution; theAppellant has not discharged his burden.16 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt20. Mr.Vagal relied on a few judgments as follows:(i) Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. Vs Lakhmi, asreported in AIR 1998 SUPREME COURT CASES 1007.Mr.Vagal relied on the observations in paragraph No.16 of this judgment, wherein it is observedthat;The law is that burden of proving such an exception is on the accused. But the merefact that accused adopted another alternative defence during his examination underSection 313 of the Cr.P.C. without referring to Exception No.1 of Section 300 of IPC isnot enough to deny him of the benefit of the Exception, if the Court can cull outmaterials from evidence pointing to the existence of circumstances leading to thatexception. It is not the law that failure to set up such a defence would foreclose theright to rely on the exception once and for all. It is axiomatic that burden on theaccused to prove any fact can be discharged either through defence evidence or eventhrough prosecution evidence by showing a preponderance of probability."17 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt In this case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, thedeposition of witnesses positively suggested that the accused would have seensomething lascivious between his wife and P.W.2 in that case, when he entered thehouse from the field.Sameer Khan Alias Vasim Azgar ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169052203/6Thus there was some positive indications in that case. However, in the present case before us, thereis no such evidence direct or indirect in favour of the Appellant.(ii) Mr.Vagal then relied on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the case of ShivpujanHarishankar Yadav, Vs. State of Maharashtra, dated 06/01/2021 passed in Criminal Appeal No.1035of 2015.In that case, the accused had sustained bleeding injury and in the same transaction he hadcommitted murder of his wife by strangulating her with a nylon rope. In that situation, his defencewas held to be probable. However, in the present case, there is not a single indication of similarnature, which could have helped the Appellant.18 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt(iii) Mr.Vagal then relied on the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court dated 15/02/2022passed in Criminal Appeal No.978 of 2012 in the case of Pravin Khimji Chauhan, Vs. The State ofMaharashtra.In that case, the conviction of the Appellant was converted from section 302 of IPC to section 304(Part-I) of the IPC. Mr.Vagal submitted that in that case the deceased wife of the accused hadsuffered 26 incised wounds and stab wounds and yet it was held by the Division Bench that it was acase of culpable homicide, not amounting to murder.The discussion in paragraph Nos.12 and 15 of that judgment shows that the Division Bench hadreferred to the statement of the accused in that case recorded by the police which showed that hewas left with a feeling of mortification. According to him he was left with a wounded pride, whichresulted in the brutal death of his wife.19 / 19 APPEAL-344-15.odt It appears from this discussion that the Division Bench had referred tothe statement given by the accused to the police, which was in the nature of confession. Mr. Vagalcould not point out how that confession was admissible for any purpose and therefore the Appellantcannot take advantage of those observations made in that case.21. Considering this discussion it is clear that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonabledoubt. On the other hand, the Appellant has not even probablised his defence. No specific defenceunder sections 105 and 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, was taken and it cannot be said thatthe burden on him could be discharged on the evidence of the prosecution itself. The prosecutionhas thus proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no scope to hold that this is not a case ofmurder, but is that of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Therefore we do not find anyreason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order. Hence the Appeal is dismissed. (SARANG V. KOTWAL, J.)                         (S. S.
