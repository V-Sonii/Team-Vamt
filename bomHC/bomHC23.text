Representation of People Act, 1951 – Whether an election petition can be thrown out at the threshold on a plea of the respondent/elected candidate that the petition is not supported by an affidavit in Form 25, as prescribed under Rule 94A of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, even though the petition is based on allegations of corrupt practices ? Held, Once there is an affidavit, albeit not in Form 25, the appropriate course would be to permit an affidavit to be filed in Form 25 – Whether the violation is made out or not would be a matter of trial but certainly not a matter to be shut out at the threshold.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Order VII Rule 11 read with Section 151 – Representation of People Act, 1951 – Ss. 33A, 83, 86 (1) proviso & (3), 100 – Conduct of Election Rules, 1962 – Section 94A – Election Petition – Form 25 – Presentation of Petitions – Contents of Petition – Trial of Election Petitions – Right to Information – Grounds for declaring election to be void – Election law is technical in nature.CORAM : HON’BLE MR.
