As far as the type of disability is concerned, i.e. column No. 11, it has been stated thatPetitioner is deaf and hard of hearing to the extent of 100%.The contention of the Respondents is that Petitioner without fulfilling the eligibility criteria appliedfor the said post and he misrepresented that he passed in Marathi subject.(viii) Petitioner was appointed by M.C.G.M. as Labour vide appointment order dated 29thSeptember, 2017 in the pay scale of Rs.5200-20200+GP Rs. 1800.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/3(ix) Petitioner as per the said appointment letter joined service in the establishment of RespondentNo.1 on the post of Labour on 9th October, 2017.(x) Petitioner received letter dated 15 th April, 2019 of Administrative Officer (MarketingDepartment) of M.C.G.M. informing him that one Mangesh Krushna Ghadi had sought copy of hisS.S.C. marksheet under the Right to Sonali 6/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc Information Act, 2005 andasking his consent for furnishing copy of the same to said Mangesh Ghadi.(xi) On 30th April, 2019, Petitioner gave consent for furnishing photocopy of his S.C.C. marksheet tosaid Mangesh Krushna Ghadi.(xii) On 18th March, 2021, Petitioner was terminated from the services of MCGM in said post ofLabour by order passed by Respondent No. 3- Assistant Commissioner (Market Department), M.

Ms. Manjiri Parasnis, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner submitted that the impugnedorder is totally illegal. The same is passed without giving any opportunity of hearing to the Sonali7/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc Petitioner. She submitted that the impugned order is violative of theprinciples of nature justice. According to her, Petitioner has not made any misrepresentation.Petitioner passed H.S.C. examination with Marathi subject of 100 marks in examination conductedin February-2017. As per the terms and conditions of the said advertisement the candidate has toobtain minimum 40% marks out of 100 marks in Marathi in 10th (S.S.C.) or equivalentexamination. She submitted that 12th standard examination (H.S.C.) is higher than 10th standardexamination (S.S.C.) and therefore, the Petitioner fulfills the condition for appointment. Shesubmitted that in any case said condition will not be applicable to the Petitioner as he is 100% deafand hard of hearing.6. In the course of hearing we put a query to learned counsel appearing for the parties whetheracquiring of eligibility criteria post advertisement and selection but prior to appointment can savesuch appointment.

Chander Shekar & Ors.(1997) 4 Supreme Court Cases 18.7. Ms. Rupali Adhate, learned counsel appearing for the Respondents submitted that Petitioner wasnot fulfilling the eligibility criteria and therefore, he should not have applied pursuant to the saidadvertisement. She submitted that Petitioner had not opted for Marathi as special subject of 100marks in S.S.C. examination and without noticing said aspect Petitioner was appointed. Said aspectwas brought to the notice of the authorities by said Mangesh Ghadi who had obtained theinformation under the Right to Information Act and thereafter, it was realized that Petitioner hadsuppressed said fact from the Respondents-MCGM. Therefore, his services were rightly terminatedon 18 th March, 2021. She relied on above mentioned condition No. 5 and condition No. 15 of thesaid advertisement to support her contention that no notice was necessary before terminatingPetitioner's service. She submitted that Petitioner was appointed through inadvertent error althoughhe was not eligible; therefore he was rightly terminated. To support her contention, Ms. Adhate,learned counsel appearing for the Respondents has relied on following judgments:-1. District Collector & Chairman, Vizianagaram Social Welfare Residential School Society,Vizianagaram & Anr. (1990) 3 Supreme Court Cases 6552. Preetesh Raman Singh Vs.

Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of theCourt.9. In the present case following points arise for determination by this Court:-(i) Whether the impugned order violates the principles of natural justice?(ii) Whether Petitioner is not eligible as per the terms and conditions of the said advertisement?10. It is admitted position that the impugned order dated 18 th March, 2021 terminating the servicesof the Petitioner was passed without issuing any show cause notice to the Petitioner and withoutgiving any opportunity to the Petitioner.11. Ms. Adhate, learned counsel for the MCGM has relied on abovereferred condition Nos. 5 and 15of the said advertisement to support her contention that principles of natural justice are notrequired to be followed while terminating the service of the Petitioner. As per the condition No. 5 ifany candidate is not fulfilling the prescribed eligibility criteria, then his candidature can be cancelledat any point of time and if such candidate is appointed in service, then he can be removed fromservice at any time. As per condition No. 15, if it is found that if candidate has submitted falseinformation/certificate/documents or suppressed any information then, his candidature can becancelled at any point of time and if such candidate has been appointed then, without giving anyprior notice to him his appointment can be cancelled.12. However, it is to be noted that Respondents are statutory Sonali 10/36 WPL.12994.2021.docauthorities constituted under the provisions of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888. It issettled position that State authorities are under an obligation to act in just, fair and reasonablemanner. A person who has been appointed in the service of MCGM cannot be terminated withoutgiving any opportunity. It is also settled legal position that doctrine of natural justice consistsprincipally of two rules, (i) nemo debet esse judex propria causa i.e. no one shall be a judge in hisown cause and (ii) audi alteram partem i.e. no decision shall be given against a party withoutaffording him a reasonable hearing. In the present case there is violation of the second rule.13. Supreme Court in Canara Bank Vs. Shri Debasis Das reported in AIR 2003 Supreme Court 2041inter alia observed that notice is the first limb of the principles of audi alteram partem. Noticeshould apprise the party the case he has to meet, and adequate time be given to the affected party tosubmit his reply. The discussion in paragraph Nos. 15 and 16 of said Canara Bank judgment issignificant and relevant portion of the same is reproduced hereinbelow:-"15. The adherence to principles of natural justice as recognized by all civilized Statesis of supreme importance when a quasi-judicial body embarks on determiningdisputes between the parties, or any administrative action involving civilconsequences is in issue. These principles are well settled. The first and foremostprinciple is what is commonly known as audi alteram partem rule. It says that no oneshould be condemned unheard. Notice is the first limb of this principle.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/6It must be precise and unambiguous. It should appraise the party determinatively the case he has tomeet. Time given for the purpose should be adequate so as to enable him to make hisrepresentation. In the absence of a notice of the kind and such reasonable opportunity, the orderpassed becomes wholly Sonali 11/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc vitiated. Thus, it is but essential that aparty should be put on notice of the case before any adverse order is passed against him. This is oneof the most important principles of natural justice. It is after all an approved rule of fair play......"(Emphasis Supplied)16. Principles of natural justice are those rules which have been laid down by the Courts as being theminimum protection of the rights of the individual against the arbitrary procedure that may beadopted by a judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative authority while making an order affectingthose rights. These rules are intended to prevent such authority from doing injustice."In paragraph 19 of said Canara Bank judgment it has been observed as follows:-"19. Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years.Rules of natural justice are not rules embodied always expressly in a statute or inrules framed thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to beperformed under a statute. What particular rule of natural justice should be impliedand what its context should be in a given case must depend to a great extent on thefacts and circumstances of that case and the frame-work of the statute under whichthe enquiry is held. The old distinction between a judicial act and an administrativeact has withered away. Even an administrative order which involves civilconsequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. Expression 'civilconsequences' encompasses infraction of not merely property or personal rights butof civil liberties, material deprivations, and non-pecuniary damages. In its wideumbrella comes everything that affects a citizen in his civil life." (Emphasis Supplied)13.1. Thus, on the touchstone of above principles if impugned order is examined then,it is clear that the same is totally illegal and bad-in-law. Petitioner who is in service ofa statutory body namely Sonali 12/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc M.C.G.M., cannot beterminated from service without giving him any notice and without giving himadequate opportunity of hearing.14. In recent judgment of Supreme Court reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 847 as also in AIR 2020Supreme Court 5215 State of U.P. Vs. Sudhir Kumar Singh and Ors., after analyzing variousjudgments on the concept of natural justice, it has been observed in paragraph 39 as follows:-"39. An analysis of the aforesaid judgments thus reveals: (1)Natural justice is aflexible tool in the hands of the judiciary to reach out in fit cases to remedy injustice.The breach of the audi alteram partem rule cannot by itself, without more, lead to theconclusion that prejudice is thereby caused.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/7(2)Where procedural and/or substantive provisions of law embody the principles ofnatural justice, their infraction per se does not lead to invalidity of the orders passed.Here again, prejudice must be caused to the litigant, except in the case of amandatory provision of law which is conceived not only in individual interest, butalso in public interest. (3)No prejudice is caused to the person complaining of thebreach of natural justice where such person does not dispute the case against him orit. This can happen by reason of estoppel, acquiescence, waiver and by way ofnon-challenge or non-denial or admission of facts, in cases in which the Court findson facts that no real prejudice can therefore be said to have been caused to the personcomplaining of the breach of natural justice.(4)In cases where facts can be stated to be admitted or indisputable, and only oneconclusion is possible, the Court does not pass futile orders of setting aside orremand when there is, in fact, no prejudice caused. This conclusion must be drawn bythe Court on an appraisal of the facts of a case, and not by the authority who deniesnatural justice to a person.(5)The "prejudice" exception must be more than a mere apprehension or even a reasonablesuspicion of a litigant. It Sonali 13/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc should exist as a matter of fact, or bebased upon a definite inference of likelihood of prejudice flowing from the non- observance ofnatural justice." (Emphasis Supplied)15. In the present case, although factual position is largely admitted there is dispute about twoissues. The dispute is only to the extent that as per the contention of the Respondents, Petitionerwithout fulfilling the eligibility criteria applied for the said post and he misrepresented that he hadpassed in Marathi subject in S.S.C. examination. However, the factual position on record clearlyshows that the Petitioner had not misrepresented and authorities have wrongly assumed thatPetitioner misrepresented M.C.G.M. Petitioner had kept the column relating to marks in Marathiblank; therefore there was no false disclosure or suppression of facts leading to misrepresentation.The authorities have also failed to take into consideration the aspect whether eligibility conditions asset out in said advertisement are applicable to Petitioner's case. By impugned order drastic action oftermination of service of Petitioner was taken. Thus, serious prejudice is caused to the Petitioner asRespondents authorities failed to issue show case notice to him before termination of service,leading to loss of job and livelihood.16. It is absolutely essential that a person who has been appointed in the employment of a publicbody like M.C.G.M. cannot be terminated without affording adequate opportunity at least in thefacts and circumstances of the present case. Terminating services of an employee by public authoritylike M.C.G.M. without affording any opportunity will be violative of Articles 14 and 21 of theConstitution of India and also contrary to the principles of natural Sonali 14/36WPL.12994.2021.doc justice. The factual position on record clearly show that grave prejudice iscaused to Petitioner. Therefore, there is substance in the contention of Ms. Parasnis, learned counselappearing for the Petitioner that the impugned order of termination of service is illegal as same iscontrary to the principles of natural justice.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/817. As regards second point, whether Petitioner fulfills eligibility criteria, it is significant to note thathe is suffering from hearing impairment in both ears and the said disability is 100%. It is alsomentioned in the disability certificate of the Petitioner issued by Government of Maharashtra thatthe said condition is permanent, non-progressive but not likely to improve.18. The said advertisement was issued as a special recruitment campaign for specially abled persons.It was a special recruitment drive under the mandate of the Persons with Disabilities (EqualOpportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as"1995 Act" ). The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016(hereinafter referred to as " 2016 Act") came into force on 27th December, 2016. By Section 102 of the said 2016 Act, the 1995 Act wasrepealed. However, sub-Section (2) of Section 102 of 2016 Act provides that notwithstanding therepeal of the said 1995 Act anything done or any action taken under the said 1995 Act shall bedeemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of the 2016 Act. Thusprovisions of both these enactments will be crucial for deciding the question involved in the presentcase. We may also mention that the said recruitment process was dehors any recruitment rules as itwas meant to recruit Sonali 15/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc only persons with disabilities in terms of the1995 Act, which was the dominant purpose of the special recruitment campaign. Before consideringthe eligibility criteria set out in the said advertisement and applicability of the same to Petitioner, itis necessary to set out hereinbelow the important aspects of "1995 Act" and "2016 Act"19. Hereinafter we will consider relevant provisions of "1995 Act."(a) Preamble of the said 1995 Act is as follows:-"An Act to give effect to the Proclamation on the Full Participation and Equality ofthe People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region.WHEREAS the Meeting to Launch the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons1993-2002 convened by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacificheld at Beijing on 1st to 5th December,1992, adopted the Proclamation on the FullParticipation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region;AND WHEREAS India is a signatory to the said Proclamation;AND WHEREAS it is considered necessary to implement the Proclamationaforesaid."

Thus the following are the important aspects of "1995 Act" and "2016 Act" as culled out from theabovereferred relevant provisions of both the enactments. The said important aspects are asfollows:-(i) The main objects behind said two enactments are:-(a) To ensure full and effective participation of differently abled persons and their inclusion insociety.Sonali                                  25/36               WPL.12994.2021.doc         (b)    To ensure equality in treating differently abled persons.         (c)    To create barrier free environment for differently abled                person.         (d)    To remove any discrimination against differently abledpersons in sharing of development benefits.(e) To ensure integration of differently abled person into the social mainstream.         (f)    To ensure equality of opportunity.         (g)    To ensure accessibility.(ii)     It is the statutory duty of State authorities to take varioussteps to further the objectives of said enactments.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/18(iii) It is the duty of the State authorities to identify posts in the establishments which can bereserved for specially abled persons.(iv) Once posts are identified by the State authorities for appointing differently abled persons, theState authorities should ensure that criteria prescribed for recruitment to said posts shall notthemselves become a barrier thereby hampering full and effective participation of specially abledperson to apply for said post. Such action would amount to discrimination of specially abled person.(v) It is the statutory responsibility of State authorities to take steps to utilize the capacity of personswith special ability by providing appropriate environment.Sonali                                   26/36              WPL.12994.2021.doc(vi)     It is the statutory responsibility of State authorities to provideappropriate barrier-free and conducive environment to employees with special ability.22. It is very clear that both "1995 Act" and "2016 Act" are enacted for protection of rights ofspecially abled persons and to create barrier-free environment for specially abled persons. One ofthe object of said enactments is to remove discrimination against specially abled persons in thesharing of development benefits vis-a- vis, non-disabled persons. Another object of both these Actsis to make special provisions for the integration of specially abled persons into the socialmainstream. These Acts are enacted for empowerment of specially abled persons. They are enactedfor protection of inherent dignity and individual autonomy of specially abled persons. They areenacted to ensure their free and effective participation and inclusion in society with the object ofacceptance of specially abled persons as part of human diversity and humanity. They are enacted forthe purpose of ensuring that due opportunity is provided to specially abled persons and forrespecting their acceptance.23. In (2010) 7 S.C.C. 626 in the case of Government of India through Secretary and Anr. Vs. RaviPrakash Gupta and Another in paragraph 22 following observations are made with respect to "1995Act"."22.We have examined the matter with great care having regard to the nature of theissues involved in relation to the intention of the legislature to provide for integrationof persons with disabilities into the social main stream and to lay down a strategy forcomprehensive development and Sonali 27/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc programmesDharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/19and services and equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities and fortheir education, training, employment and rehabilitation amongst otherresponsibilities. We have considered the matter from the said angle to ensure that theobject of the Disabilities Act, 1995, which is to give effect to the proclamation on thefull participation and equality of the people with disabilities in the Asian and PacificRegion, is fulfilled." (Emphasis Supplied)24. In (2014) 14 S.C.C. 383 in the case of Justice Sunanda Bhandare Foundation Vs. Union of Indiaand Another , Supreme Court made observations regarding approach to be adopted by theGovernment authorities while implementing the provisions of "1995 Act". Paragraph 9 of saidjudgment is as follows:-"9. Be that as it may, the beneficial provisions of the 1995 Act cannot be allowed toremain only on paper for years and thereby defeating the very purpose of such lawand legislative policy. The Union, States, Union Territories and all those upon whomobligation has been cast under the 1995 Act have to effectively implement it. As amatter of fact, the role of the governments in the matter such as this has to beproactive. In the matters of providing relief to those who are differently abled, theapproach and attitude of the executive must be liberal and relief oriented and notobstructive or lethargic. A little concern for this class who are differently abled can dowonders in their life and help them stand on their own and not remain on mercy ofothers. A welfare State, that India is, must accord its best and special attention to asection of our society which comprises of differently abled citizens. This is trueequality and effective conferment of equal opportunity."(Emphasis Supplied)25. In (2013) 10 S.C.C. 772 Union of India and Another Vs. National Federation of theBlind and Others , the Supreme Court in paragraph Nos. 23 and 50 observed asfollows:-"23. India as a welfare State is committed to promote overall development of itscitizens including those who are differently Sonali 28/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc abledin order to enable them to lead a life of dignity, equality, freedom and justice asmandated by the Constitution of India. The roots of statutory provisions for ensuringequality and equalization of opportunities to the differently abled citizens in ourcountry could be traced in Part III and Part IV of the Constitution. For the personswith disabilities, the changing world offers more new opportunities owing totechnological advancement, however, the actual limitation surfaces only when theyare not provided with equal opportunities. Therefore, bringing them in the societybased on their capabilities is the need of the hour."(Emphasis Supplied) "50. Employment is a key factor in the empowerment andinclusion of people with disabilities. It is an alarming reality that the disabled peopleDharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/20are out of job not because their disability comes in the way of their functioning ratherit is social and practical barriers that prevent them from joining the workforce. As aresult, many disabled people live in poverty and in deplorable conditions. They aredenied the right to make a useful contribution to their own lives and to the lives oftheir families and community."26. We will hereinafter examine facts of the present case on the touchstone of the relevant aspects ofthe said enactments set out in earlier part of this judgment and the principles set out in the abovereferred judgments of the Supreme Court. It is significant to note that both these enactments aresocial welfare legislations enacted for the benefit of persons with disabilities and its provisions mustbe so interpreted in order to fulfill its objective. The Supreme Court has observed that the role of theState authorities should be proactive and approach and attitude of the executive must be liberal andrelief oriented and not obstructive.27. The important terms and conditions of said advertisement relevant for the present discussionare as follows:-Sonali                                  29/36           WPL.12994.2021.doc(i)      passing of 10th standard (S.S.C.) or equivalent examination byobtaining minimum 40% marks with Marathi subject of 100 marks.(ii) candidate should be able to read, write and speak in Marathi language.(iii) Candidate should have necessary knowledge of Marathi, Hindi languages as per therequirement of the post. (Condition No.20)(iv) Candidate should be a resident of Maharashtra. (Condition No.24)28. Petitioner is suffering from 100% hearing impairment of both ears. Admittedly, Petitioner ishaving 100% disability. He is suffering from said disability since his birth. Section 2(c) of the 2016Act inter alia defines "barrier" to mean any factor including communicational which hampers thefull and effective participation of specially abled persons in society. Section 2(f) inter alia defines"communication" as including means and formats of communication, languages etc. Thus,identifying post of "Labour" for specially abled candidates and thereafter putting eligibilityconditions which will act as barrier is totally contrary to the provisions of the said enactments.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/21Section 3 of the "2016 Act" is regarding equality and non-discrimination. Sub- section (2) of section3 of 2016 Act provides that State shall take steps to utilize the capacity of persons with disabilities byproviding appropriate environment. Sub-section (3) of section 3 of 2016 Act provides that speciallyabled person shall not be discriminated on the ground of disability, unless it is shown that theimpugned act or omission is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. In Sonali 30/36WPL.12994.2021.doc the light of these provisions it is also to be noted that Petitioner was in theservice of the M.C.G.M. on the post of Labour since 29 th September, 2017 till his termination on 18th March, 2021 i.e. for about 3 years and 6 months. It is not the contention of M.C.G.M. that thePetitioner had failed to perform his duties as Labour during the said 3 years and 6 months in view oflack of said eligibility criteria i.e., in not having Marathi subject of 100 marks in S.S.C. examination.Thus, applicability of the above eligibility requirements are required to be considered keeping inmind various provisions of the said enactments, object behind the same and the disability which heis suffering.29. While considering the question of applicability of said eligibility condition to Petitioner's case, itis absolutely essential to adopt a pragmatic approach which will further the object behind "1995 Act"and "2016 Act". Thus, the terms and conditions of the said advertisement are required to beunderstood and interpreted in a manner which will ensure full and effective participation ofspecially abled persons and their inclusion in society. The said advertisement also reserves certainseats for persons who suffer from blindness. Person who suffers from 100% blindness may not beable to write Marathi (except in braille)and will not be able to read Marathi (except in braille). Thus,to fulfill objective behind enacting "1995 Act" and "2016 Act" in full and effective manner in thepresent case it is absolutely necessary that the terms and conditions of the said advertisement arerequired to be interpreted and applied in a sensible manner by taking a practical and reasonableapproach. It is also very necessary to show flexibility as per the requirements of Sonali 31/36WPL.12994.2021.doc individual cases. Thus, while considering the applicability of said terms andconditions it is also required to keep in mind nature of disability suffered by a particular speciallyabled person who has applied for posts identified for specially abled person. All the specially abledpersons can not be judged by applying the same yardstick.30. One of the essential qualification as set out in the said advertisement is that a candidate shouldbe able to write, read and speak Marathi language. Condition No. 20 stipulates that candidateshould have necessary knowledge of Marathi and Hindi languages as per the requirements of thepost. In fact, eligibility condition of passing of S.S.C. or equivalent examination by obtainingminimum 40% marks in Marathi subject is to ensure that candidate should be able to write, readand speak Marathi language. Admittedly, Petitioner is suffering from 100% hearing impairment.Therefore, he may not be able to speak Marathi or for that matter any spoken language. Thus, it isabsolutely essential to adopt liberal approach which will further the object behind "1995 Act" and"2016 Act" while considering the question of applicability of said eligibility condition to Petitioner'scase.31. In a recruitment of this nature dealing with persons with disabilities, authorities should adoptpragmatic and sensitive approach and not hypertechnical approach. Otherwise identification ofposts in establishments by State authorities for specially abled persons will become redundant byDharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/22prescribing eligibility criteria which will act as barrier, rather than facilitating the object of the twoActs. Such actions will be discriminatory and contrary to the Sonali 32/36 WPL.12994.2021.docprovisions of "1995 Act" as well as "2016 Act".32. Thus, it is clear that the qualifications as contained in said advertisement are to be understoodand interpreted in pragmatic manner, in the light of object of the aforesaid enactments which are tobe fulfilled and for furthering the said object. The eligibility conditions are also required to beunderstood and interpreted from the point of view of the disability which the particular speciallyabled person is suffering.33. It has been mentioned in the petition that Petitioner is a resident of Kalwa, District-Thane andhas taken education in Maharashtra. It is further stated in the petition that Petitioner is brought upin the State of Maharashtra, specially around Mumbai and Thane, and therefore, he is wellacquainted with Marathi language from childhood.34. It is also significant to note that Petitioner has not made any misrepresentation to the M.C.G.M.He has produced his marksheet of 10th standard and in the column regarding marks obtained inMarathi subject, the same is kept blank. It is clear that there is no misrepresentation or suppressionby Petitioner. Thus, there is no substance in the contention of Respondents that Petitioner hasmisrepresented or suppressed certain information.35. We find that the authorities have adopted very hyper-technical approach and has completelyignored the object to be achieved under both the enactments. If the qualification which is set out inSonali 33/36 WPL.12994.2021.doc the advertisement is very strictly construed, then that will violatethe object of both the enactments and will act as barrier and will be discriminatory. Thus, the saidqualification as set out in the advertisement will not apply to the Petitioner who is suffering from100% disability of hearing impairment.36. Ms. Manjiri Parasnis, learned counsel for the Petitioner and Ms. Rupali Adhate, learned counselfor the Respondents relied on several authorities on the aspect of relevant date of application ofeligibility criteria to be considered for selection. In fact we had put up a query as to whethersubsequent acquisition of qualification or higher qualification would save the selection orappointment as Petitioner had Marathi as a subject in the H.S.C. examination securing 43% marks.Almost all the judgments which are cited by both the sides takes the view that the cut off date byreference to which the eligibility requirement must be satisfied by the candidate seeking a publicemployment is the date appointed by the relevant service rules and if there be no cut off dateappointed by the rules then such date as may be appointed for the purpose in the advertisementcalling for applications. It is further held that if there be no such date appointed then the eligibilitycriteria shall be applied by reference to the last date appointed by which the applications have to bereceived by the competent authority. It has been held that in the absence of fixed date indicated inthe advertisement/notification inviting applications with reference to which the requisitequalifications should be judged, the only certain date for scrutiny of the qualifications will be the lastdate for making the applications.Dharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/23Sonali                                  34/36            WPL.12994.2021.doc37. Ms. Rupali Adhate, learned counsel for the Respondents also relied on the case reported inPreetesh Raman Singh (supra) and particularly on paragraph 14 of the same. The said paragraph isas follows:-"14. This Court lately in State of Gujarat v. Arvind Kumar T. Tiwari AIR 2012 SC 3281held: A person who docs not possess the requisite qualification cannot even apply forrecruitment for the reason that his appointment would be contrary to the statutoryrules, and would therefore, he void in law. Lacking eligibility for the post cannot becured at any stage and appointing such a person would amount to serious illegalityand not mere irregularity. Such a person cannot approach the court for any relief forthe reason that he does not have a right which can be enforced through court. (Sec.Prit Singh v. S. K. Mangal 1993 Supp (1) SCC 714 and Pramod Kumar v. U. P.Secondary Education Services Commission (2008) 7 SCC153.)".38. There is no dispute about the abovereferred legal position. However, the same is not relevant forthe present case, as we have come to the conclusion that the above referred qualifying conditions arenot applicable to the Petitioner having regard to the fact that it was a special recruitment drive forproviding employment to persons with disabilities in terms of the two enactments. As we have seenthe dominant object is to recruit persons with disabilities. The focus therefore should be to fulfill thedominant objective by facilitating such recruitment and not by erecting barrier. We may remindourselves that disability knows no barrier. As Supreme Court has said employment is a key factor inthe empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities. This must always be borne in mind bythe employer while conducting such recruitment.Sonali                                    35/36            WPL.12994.2021.docDharmendra Ravipratap Singh vs Municipal Corporation For ... on 7 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150333321/2439. Ms. Rupali Adhate, learned counsel for Respondents also relied on the judgment in the case ofDistrict Collector & Chairman, Vizianagaram Social Welfare Residential School Society,Vizianagaram and Another (supra) and particularly on paragraph No.6 of the same. The saidparagraph 6 is set out hereinbelow:-"6. It must further be realised by all concerned that when an advertisement mentionsa particular qualification and an appointment is made in disregard of the same, it isnot a matter only between the appointing authority and the appointee concerned. Theaggrieved are all those who had similar or even better qualifications than theappointee or appointees but who had applied for the post because they did notpossess the qualifications mentioned in the advertise- ment. It amounts to a fraud onpublic to appoint persons with inferior qualifications in such circumstances unless itis clearly stated that the qualifications are relaxable. No court should be a party to theperpetuation of the fraudu- lent practice. We are afraid that the Tribunal lost sight ofthis fact."39.1. However, in the present case, as we have already discussed, Petitioner was appointed on thebasis of his 100% disability and marks obtained by him in 10 th standard examination, question ofany misrepresentation or practicing fraud does not arise. Thus the above observations are notapplicable in the facts and circumstances of this case.40.
