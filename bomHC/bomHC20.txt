CORAM: BHARATI DANGRE, J.RESERVED ON : 23RD SEPTEMBER, 2021 PRONOUNCED ON : 28TH SEPTEMBER, 2021ORDER:-1. The four applications are instituted by the Applicants, seeking their release on bail on beingcharge-sheeted. Barring the Applicant-Roshini Kapoor, all the three other Applicants arecharge-sheeted in the second charge-sheet vide 13/07/2021.All the four Applicants are represented by the respective senior counsel, who have vehementlypressed into service the most cherished principle, which forms integral part of the Constitution andthe arguments revolve around the Applicants being deprived of their liberty, without following thedue process of law. It is asseverated that liberty of a citizen is of paramount importance and itcannot be incised and the investigating agency should be conscious of the well settled principle thatthe power to arrest is altogether different than M.M.Salgaonkar 4/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc the needfor arrest. Denying a person his liberty is argued to be a serious matter and the collective submissionis to the effect that the CBI did not deem it ft to seek the custody of the Applicants, during the courseof investigation nor were they brought into custody when the charge-sheet was instituted, but whenthe Applicants put an appearance before the learned Special Judge, on issuance of summons andmoved an application for bail, they ought to have been released on bail.The fulcrum of the arguments of the respective learned senior counsel is the latest decision of theHon'ble Apex Court in case of Aman Preet Singh V. CBI through Director 1 dated 02/09/2021,where the Hon'ble Supreme Court granted imprimatur to the judgment of the Delhi High Court inCourt on its own motion V. Central Bureau of Investigation 2 and has settled the principles for aMagistrate while exercising the powers under Section 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short,"The Code"). The parameters laid down in the aforesaid decision, which are argued to be based on arationale that if a person has been enlarged and free for many years and when he was not arrestedduring investigation, to suddenly direct his arrest and to keep him incarcerated merely because the2 2004(72) DRJ 629 M.M.Salgaonkar 5/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc charge-sheet has been fled, has beenheld to be contrary to the governing principles of grant of bail.2. Drawing an analogy from the authoritative pronouncement in case of Aman Preet Singh (supra)and an earlier decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Case of Siddharth V. State of U.P.3, it is arguedthat as far as the present Applicants are concerned, during investigation their custody was notsought by the investigating agency and when the cognizance of the offence was taken, on20/08/2021, the Court deemed it ft to issue summons and to obey the dictate, the Applicants puttheir appearance before the Special Judge and moved distinct applications seeking release on bail, inlight of the well discerned principles in case of Aman Preet Singh (supra). It is argued that thefactum of they not having been arrested during investigation or not being produced in custody itselfentitle them to be released on bail, without probing into the gravity of accusations. It is urged thatother relevant considerations for being released on bail; fight risk and likelihood of tampering withthe prosecution case neither existed during the course of investigation nor have been 3 Cri.AppealRoshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/3No.832 of 2021 decided on 16/08/2021 M.M.Salgaonkar 6/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc expressed beforethe Trial Court. In these peculiar facts, the impugned order rejecting the bail applications, issubjected to heavy criticism as not adhering to the procedure established by law. It is also argued bythe learned senior counsel that sometimes wrong practices, which are mechanically followed, mayresult into an inconvenient situation, but ultimately since the procedure can only be considered ashandmaid of justice, substantive justice itself cannot be avoided. A decision of Allahabad High Courtin case of Vishwa Nathi Jiloka & Ors. V. Ist Munsif Lower Criminal Court, Baharaich & Ors. 4 anddecision of the Kerala High Court in case of Sreekumar V. State of Kerala5, is pressed into service.Learned senior counsel would submit that such an approach would result in travesty of justice,which at any cost, cannot be tolerated. The hype created in case of economic offences in which thepresent case falls into is delusion is another submission and to that effect, decision of the Hon'bleApex Court in case of Sushila Aggarwal & Ors. V. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr. 6 is cited. The pivotalpoint on which the release of the Applicants is sought to be propagated is the principle of 'Bail is therule and jail is an exception'.4 1989 SCC Online All 2285 2008 SCC OnLine Ker 3186 (2020) 5 SCC 1M.M.Salgaonkar                                       7/27                 BA-3323-21+3.doc3.      I        have   heard        Mr.Venegaonkar,   learned         counselrepresenting the CBI.               He admit that the CBI did not seekcustody of the Applicants during investigation, but he would urge that when the Applicants movedan application for being released on bail, on appearance before the Special Judge, by referring to thematerial compiled in the charge-sheet, the CBI opposed the application for release on bail, byinviting attention of the Court to the gravity of accusations and also expressing the chance oftampering with the case of the prosecution. He placed reliance on the decision of the Single Judge ofDelhi High Court in case of Sharad Kumar V. CBI 7 and his submission is to the effect that once theApplicants had surrendered to the jurisdiction of the Special Court, the learned Judge was dutybound to consider the application for release on bail on the parameters recognized by the Code andin any case, merely because they were not arrested during investigation, will not solely make thementitled for being released on bail. Learned counsel would submit that the Applicants by arguingtheir applications on merit and having invited the order, now cannot make a grievance.Roshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/47 2011(125) DRJ 200M.M.Salgaonkar                                       8/27                     BA-3323-21+3.doc4.

On20/09/2021, the Application is rejected and the submission of Mr. Ponda is to the effect that therejection is in derogation of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in case of Aman Preet Singh(supra).8. The Code, which governs the procedure applicable to all the criminal proceedings succinctly setsRoshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/8out the distinction M.M.Salgaonkar 16/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc between an 'inquiry', 'investigation'and 'judicial proceedings'. The Code provides not merely for judicial proceedings or trial of allegedoffence, but contains exhaustive provisions for investigation thereof. Chapter XII of the Code setsout the provision for investigation into cognizable and non-cognizable offence, which include aspecifc provision for report to be submitted by the police offcer on completion of investigation.Section 169 in the said Chapter provides for release of an accused when the evidence is defcientwhereas Section 170 sets out the procedure, where there is suffcient evidence or reasonable groundto forward the accused to Magistrate, which would include forwarding of the accused under custody.Chapter XVI deals with commencement of proceedings before the Magistrate and includes Section204, which provides for issuance of process, if in the opinion of the Magistrate taking cognizance ofthe offence, there is suffcient ground for proceedings against him. As per the Scheme contained inthe Code, the investigation is a normal preliminary to an accused being put up for trial for acognizable offence. Investigation thus commences on receipt of information relating to an offencecommitted, by an offcer in charge of the police station and culminates on submission of the reportunder Section 173.M.M.Salgaonkar                                   17/27                    BA-3323-21+3.docWhen the process is issued, the Magistrate may dispense with the personal attendance of theaccused. Chapter XVIII enlists the procedure pertaining to trial to be conducted before the Court ofSessions. The investigation at the hands of the police, which stands crystallized in the form ofcharg-sheet when placed before the Court, the cognizance of the offence is taken if the materialcompiled in the charge-sheet disclose suffcient material to proceed with the trial. Once thecognizance is taken by the Court of competent jurisdiction, the accused comes under the control ofthe said court and would abide by the direction of the court and it is thereafter that he shall besubjected to trial. Taking cognizance, though not defned in the Code, it is understood as applicationof mind to the suspected commission of an offence.9. When the accused, who is now charge-sheeted appears before the Court, he can be stated to be injudicial custody and submit to the directions of the Court. In case of Nirmal Jeet Kaur v. State ofM.P.8, the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as under:"16. The crucial question is when a person is in custody, within the meaning ofSection 439 Criminal Procedure Code? When he is in 8 (2004) 7 SCC 558M.M.Salgaonkar 18/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc duress either because he is held by theinvestigating agency or other police or allied authority or is under the control of theRoshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/9court having been remanded by judicial order, or having offered himself to the court'sjurisdiction and submitted to its orders by physical presence. No lexical dexterity norprecedential profusion is needed to come to the realistic conclusion that he who isunder the control of the court or is in the physical hold to an offcer with coercivepower is in custody for the purpose of Section 439. The word is of elastic semanticsbut its core meaning is that the law has taken control of the person."10. It is imperative to state that the powers under Section 170 of the Code are to be exercised by theMagistrate as per the contingency emerging from the factual matrix qua each of the criminalproceeding being brought to the Courts' jurisdiction. It would be worth while, to observe thatSection 170 in the Code is a procedural provision depending upon the facts and circumstances,emerging before the Court and cannot be in any case, classifed as a mere formality, as sought to beadvanced. Further, Section 170 contemplates grant of bail looking to the nature of formality if theoffence is bailable. There is, however, no indication or mandate culled out in Section 170 as regardsthe power of the Magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction for grant of bail in cases where the offencesare non-bailable.M.M.Salgaonkar                                  19/27                BA-3323-21+3.docIn any case, the Magistrate or any Court, who is bestowed with the power to grant bail, will alwayshave to follow the parameters and rigours enveloping the discretion for grant of bail. Nowhere in theCode there is a mandate for grant of bail in nature of formality, as is sought to be canvassed beforeme based on the provision contained in Section 170. It is crystal clear that the power and discretionto grant bail by any Court is envisaged in Sections 437 and 439 of the Code. It only in the case ofbailable offences, the Court of Magistrate will release the person on bail, but that too after procuringsecurity for his appearance on a fxed date as well as for his attendance before the Court, unlessotherwise directed.11. In absence of any provision or procedure for releasing an accused on bail in a non-bailableoffence, as adumbrated in Section 170 of the Code, the powers available therein can be sought to bemade applicable in every contingency, as buttressed in the present facts and circumstances.For the aforesaid reasons, concededly the Applicants appeared before the Court and sought bail, bypreferring an application under Section 439 of the Code and this assumes insurmountablesignifcance in the present circumstances for M.M.Salgaonkar 20/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc the obviousreason that the application for grant of regular bail before any Court would give rise to apresumption that the accused is in custody and that particular Court is duty bound to apply its mindRoshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/10to the material set forth before it, moreso for the reason that fling of charge-sheet ipso factoindicates commission of offences, as per the prosecution and the material collated is compiled in thecharge-sheet. In any case, if material brought on record indicates the gravity of the offence andculpability as well as complicity of the accused persons then in that case, the Court is duty bound toexercise its power, which have been invoked by preferring an application as per Sections 437 and439 of the Code.12. The Court of the Magistrate or the Sessions Court cannot be held bereft of power and jurisdictionto grant bail or decline bail, once an application is preferred before it and in such a contingency, thesaid Court is duty bound to take into account the evident material, emerging from the charge-sheet.In cases where the offences alleged indicate that they are grave, heinous, barbaric, seditious oraimed at damaging the fnancial health of the State, then in that case the concerned Court is expectedto take into consideration various factors M.M.Salgaonkar 21/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc andparameters, including the gravity of the accusations which by this time are crystallized in form of thecharge-sheet while deciding the entitlement of the accused as to whether to admit him to bail orotherwise.13. Minute perusal of the judgments cited at the bar and also the recent decision of the Hon'ble ApexCourt in case of Aman Preet Singh (supra) makes it abundantly clear that it is not the ratio for theproposition that any accused guilty of serious, heinous or a crime of high magnitude can be releasedon bail by operation of Section 170 of the Code. The Court in fact, is duty bound to apply its mind tovariable factors, embalming the criminal proceedings before exercising its power for grant of bail orotherwise. In any case, total reliance placed on the judgment of the Apex Court cited supra, cannotcome to the aid of the present Applicants obviously for the reason that going by their own act of theyapplying for bail indicates that they are in custody of the Court and, therefore, reliance placed uponSections 87 and 88 of the Code, cannot be of much help in order to canvass automatic bail. Thescrutiny of the judgments in case of Siddharth (supra) and Aman Preet Singh (supra), ipso factoreveal that the said decisions are not M.M.Salgaonkar 22/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc authority of law asregards grant of bail in grave and heinous offence as a matter of procedure or formality by merelyinvoking Section 170 of the Code. Parameters or yardsticks as laid down by the Delhi High Court inCourt on its own motion (supra) itself indicate that the person who is not in custody can only seekbeneft of Section 170. Moreover, para 22 of the decision of the Delhi High Court, which precedes theissuance of directions to the police/investigating agencies as well as the directions to CriminalCourt, when carefully read, would reveal that while dealing with a situation, where the Special Courthad returned the charge-sheet by forcing the CBI to arrest the accused, which otherwise never feltthe necessity of arresting him even for the purpose of investigation and apprehension of the accusedbeing denied beneft of bail in-spite of offence being devoid of high magnitude and severepunishments, the learned Judge (His Lordship Justice J. Kapoor) referred to his earlier judgmentsissuing directions based on the legal position. While charting out the procedure to be adopted by theinvestigating agency, it is held that unless arrest is necessary for the purpose of investigation orcustodial interrogation, it shall not be adopted as a routine course, but with a clarifcation that arrestmay be necessary if the offence is of grave nature and M.M.Salgaonkar 23/27 BA-3323-21+3.docprescribes severe punishment. The directions for the Criminal Courts fnd its genesis in the wellsettled principle in case of Joginder Kumar V. State of U.P.9 that arrest cannot be made in a routineRoshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/11manner as it amounts to deprivation of a person's liberty. The illustration given is in regard to theoffences under Section 498A, where though the accused is not arrested during investigation, he isdirected to be arrested at the stage of fling of charge-sheet.14. The fact, therefore, remains that the accused who has been allegedly involved in commission ofheinous and grave offence, should be investigated and in view of the fact that if the incriminatingmaterial is to be seized or fruitful information is to be elicited then arrest can be adverted to. Arrestcan also become necessary if the offence is of grave nature and there is likelihood of the offenderabsconding or feeing away from justice. This would all depend upon the facts and circumstances ofeach case as in every case, full co- operation from a suspect would convert him to an accused andfrom an accused to a convict and to bring the investigation to its logical end. When on completion ofinvestigation, the fnal report is tendered before the Court, the Court is duty bound to 9 1994 SCC (4)260 M.M.Salgaonkar 24/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc aid and assist the cause of the prosecution and thepower and discretion to grant bail would always depend upon the claim and demand raised by theprosecution for custody of the offender lest police or magisterial for having the profoundinvestigation, deep probe and arrival of the conclusion, indicating total involvement of the accused.15. In the instant case, it is apparent that all the Applicants are alleged to have indulged incommission of offences, which have resulted in serious dent to the fnancial health of the State aswell as defrauding the public at large. Such offences are occurring in plenty and have resulted instultifying overall growth of the nation and also have caused tremendous impairment to theeconomy of the nation. These crimes are more heinous in nature as they intend to destroy theeconomic fabric and fnancial edifce of the State. Such crimes have the tendency to degrade and defythe faith of the public in law and order situation as it tantamount to a serious blow to itseconomic/fnancial condition.In view of the above, it is incumbent upon the Court, who deals with the application for grant of bail,to exercise its power and discretion on the basis of the material put forth by M.M.Salgaonkar 25/27BA-3323-21+3.doc the prosecution and would also be subject to the necessity shown by theprosecution for seeking custody as per the culpability and complicity of the particular accused forproving the deep involvement of each accused and unfold and unearth the modus operandi in theembezzlement in order to drive a conclusion about the involvement of each of the accused person.On the application for bail being fled, the CBI has opposed the release of the Applicants on theground that the Applicants are infuential and affuent persons and the probable witnesses are theemployees and grave apprehension is expressed that if the Applicants are released on bail, they mayinfuence the witnesses and tamper the evidence. It was urged before the Court that keeping in mindthe grave offence, discretionary power to grant bail shall not be exercised. In State v. Jaspal SinghGill10, the Hon'ble Apex Court expressed the view that the court before granting bail in casesinvolving non-bailable offences, particularly where the trial has not yet commenced should take intoconsideration various factors such as the nature and seriousness of the offence, character of theevidence, circumstances peculiar to the accused, a reasonable possibility of the accused notpresenting himself during trial and reasonable apprehension of witnesses being 10 (1984) 3 SCC555: AIR 1984 SC 1503 M.M.Salgaonkar 26/27 BA-3323-21+3.doc tampered with and the largerinterest of the society or the State.Roshini Kapoor D/O Rana Kapoor vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106387515/1216. In any case, considering the three anterior stages, before converting a suspect to a convict, whichinvolves a stage of actual interrogation when an accused is taken in police custody, followed by thestage of judicial custody, which ensure completion of investigation and collection of the material inform of the fnal report to be placed before the Magistrate/Competent Court, which is duty bound toensure a fair trial. It is only upon the presentation of the charge-sheet, where the full material iscompiled together, the gravity of the offence could be judged and, the possibility of conviction of anaccused being surfaced on the basis of the material coming before the Court in a crystallized form,prompted the learned Special Judge to reject the application for bail. Dispensation of arrest at thestage of investigation need not continue throughout and in particular, when the offence made outagainst the Applicants has now clearly emerged in the charge-sheet as a grave economic offence and,the witnesses who will participate in the trial apparently surfacing, the Applicants do not deservetheir release on bail.M.M.Salgaonkar                                  27/27                    BA-3323-21+3.docAll the applications, therefore, deserve a rejection and are accordingly rejected.[SMT.
