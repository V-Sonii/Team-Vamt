The facts in the matter are briefly set out hereunder :BANNING ORDER AGAINST RESPONDENT NO.26. The subject tenders issued by BARC all contain identical eligibility clauses requiring that:"3. The bidder should have the following:(m) Contractor shall furnish declaration that he has not been debarred fromtendering by any authority/agency""7. ..Even though any bidder may satisfy the above requirements, he should be liableto disqualification, if he has- Made any misleading or false representation or deliberately suppressed theinformation in the forms, statements and enclosures required in the eligibility criteriadocument,- Record of poor performance such as abandoning work, not properly completing thecontract or financial failures/ weaknesses etc.9.

The controversy at hand arises from the fact that Respondent No.2 was admittedly 'banned' byNPCIL. In this behalf, the relevant facts are that in or about 2019, Respondent No.2 had participatedin and was declared as a successful bidder in a tender floated by the NPCIL for hiring of materialhandling equipment. A Work Order was issued by NPCIL in the name of Respondent No.2.However, Respondent No.2 refused to accept the Work Order, apparently on the ground that it wasno longer commercially viable.8. On 7th October 2019, NPCIL issued a Show Cause Notice to Respondent No.2, asking RespondentNo.2 to show cause why it should not be banned from participating in any tender of NPCIL for aperiod 2 years. Respondent No.2 filed a detailed reply dated 19th October 2019 to the Show CauseNotice issued by NPCIL. Respondent no.2 inter alia submitted that that the Work Order which ithad refused on the grounds that it was commercially unviable, was being re-tendered for Rs.94,01,750/-. This was a significant revision upwards from the earlier estimation of Rs.51,81,436/-.In fact, according to Respondent No.2, this was evidence of un-viability.M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/59.

Ltd is hereby 'Banfor making any kinds of business with the Corporation in future for the period of 02(two) years at Tarapur, Maharashtra Site and all other entire Units-Sites as well as allprojects of NPCIL across the country, w.e.f receipt of this order of 'Banning'11. One of the enumerated effects of the Banning Order was that Respondent No.2 would not beallowed to submit a bid. Another effect was that Respondent No.2 would not be allowed toparticipate in any business in its own name or as a sub-vendor or sub-contractor and any bidsalready submitted would be rejected. The ban imposed under this Order appears to have beenlimited to NPCIL. However, a copy of this Order was marked, inter alia to the BARC.12. Respondent No.2 submitted its bid in response to the 1 st Tender, after the Banning Order waspassed. As aforesaid, Clause 3(m) of the Notice inviting the 1 st tender required Respondent No.2 tosubmit a declaration to the effect that it "not been debarred from tendering by anyauthority/agency". Respondent No.2 submitted a declaration to BARC stating that they have notbeen debarred by any authority/ agency of BARC-NRB. It however, also stated that:"However, recently, M/s NPCIL-Tarapur has issued notice for banning of business with NPCILunilaterally. Hence, we have initiated procedure for Kanchan P Dhuri 9 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odtrevoking the said notice".13. Two things are therefore immediately apparent: First, Respondent No.2 added the words "ofBARC-NRB" in its declaration. This, to our mind, is because it was aware that it could not make thedeclaration as required under the tender. Second, the word "Notice" for banning was clearlyincorrect, there was an Order of Banning.14. Respondent No.2 challenged the Banning Order by filing a Suit before the Ld. Civil judge, SeniorJudge, Palghar. As the following paragraphs will show, the motion filed seeking interim reliefseventually came to be dismissed. CREATION OF A FRESH PROFILE ON THE TENDER WIZARDPORTAL15. Pursuant to the Banning Order, Respondent No.2 was reflected as "blacklisted" on the TenderWizard portal, a centralised portal through which bids were to be submitted.M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/616. Ordinarily, the reflection of its status as "blacklisted" would have prevented Respondent No.2from placing its bid for any tender floated by the BARC through the Tender Wizard Portal. However,Respondent No.2 participated in the 1 st Tender by creating a fresh profile on the Tender WizardPortal. Respondent No.2 created a new User ID, linked to a different email ID, and DSC Serialnumber etc on the Portal. Respondent No.2 also reflected its status as an "individual" despite beinga company.Kanchan P Dhuri 10 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt17. Respondent No.2 does not dispute the fact that it created such a fresh profile. However,Respondent No. 2 has submitted before us that it was justified in creating a fresh profile.Respondent No.2 claims that although the Banning Order applied only to tenders issued by NPCIL,the Tender Wizard Portal incorrectly blocked Respondent No.2 from placing its bid in respect of anyand every tender issued through the Portal. It appears that Respondent No.2 wrote to NPCIL on 26th August, 2020, expressing its grievance that the Tender Wizard portal had blacklisted them fromall other tenders, apart from those issued by NPCIL. Respondent No.2 sought that their User ID beunblocked in respect of all other agencies. NPCIL addressed letters dated 28th August, 2020 and15th September 2020 to the Tender Wizard Portal, asking them to introduce the necessary featurefor unit-wise banning.18. Respondent No.2 claims that on 16th September 2020, the DAE Helpdesk/ Support Desk of theTender Wizard Portal wrote to Respondent No.2, noting that they had created a new ID and stating"Please note that you can participate in the tender called by other DAE Departments with newcredentials, except NPCIL". It is in light of the correspondence exchanged that, on or about 15 thSeptember 2020, Respondent No.2 created a new profile and submitted its bid.19. The Petitioner submits that a week later, on or about 22 nd September 2020, it found out aboutthe Banning Order against Respondent No.2. The Petitioner accordingly filed a complaint withBARC, claiming that Respondent No.2 had Kanchan P Dhuri 11 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt defraudedBARC.20. Roughly two months later, on 5 th November 2020, Respondent No.2 moved an interimapplication for injunction before the Ld. Civil Judge, Senior Division, Palghar, seeking an injunctionon the Banning Order. By an Order dated 12 th November 2020, the Ld. Civil Judge, SeniorDivision, Palghar directed NPCIL and Respondent No.2 to maintain "status quo".21. In the meantime, the Tender Evaluation Committee of the BARC examined the bids submitted inresponse to the 1 st tender. A letter of offer was issued to Respondent No.2 on 5th February, 2021and a Work Order followed on 5 th March 2021. Respondent No.2 is now on site and carrying outwork.22. It appears that the BARC took up the Petitioner's Complaint dated 22 nd September 2020 onlyon 9th March 2021, pursuant to an email from the office of the Secretary of the Department ofAtomic Energy. The Complaint was disposed off with the remark "No further Action" on the groundsM/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/7that the Banning Order is restricted only to NPCIL Tenders.23. In the meantime, BARC called for the 2nd Tender dated 3rd February, 2021 in respect of work ofmaintenance of lawns, shrubs, hedges and plant installations at the BARC Plant Site, Tarapur, forthe year 2021-2023. The Petitioner and Respondent No.2 participated in the 2nd Tender.24. The Tender Evaluation Committee, by its Report dated 13 th July, 2021 Kanchan P Dhuri 12 / 25WP-6373-2021.odt once again found Respondent No.2 to be qualified in respect of the 2 nd Tender.Although the Report makes no express reference to the Notice Inviting Tender or the BanningOrder, it observes that Respondent No.2 is qualified for participation in opening Financial Bid"subject to acceptance of debar document by Competent Authority".25. The Committee recommended that a Work Order be issued to Respondent No.2. Such a WorkOrder is yet to be issued.26. In these circumstances on 2nd September, 2021, the Petitioner filed this Writ Petition. Thematter was heard including on 11 th October 2021, when we were informed that the Banning Orderwas impugned before the Ld. Civil Judge, Senior Division, Palghar, who had by Order dated 12 thNovember, 2020, directed parties to maintain "status quo".27. We were informed that the Ld. Judge had heard the Interim Application and had listed thematter for orders. Accordingly, the matter was kept on 21 st October, 2021 when the Order wasforwarded to us in a sealed cover.28. By an Order dated 20th October 2021, the Ld. Civil Judge, Senior Division, Palghar rejectedRespondent No.2's Application for interim relief against the Banning Order. Respondent No.2 filedan appeal against the aforesaid Order before the Learned Additional District Judge, Palghar, whoalso dismissed the appeal. Thus, the said Banning Order is effective and in force till today.Kanchan P Dhuri 13 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt29. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 4 have filed detailed Affidavits dated 25 th October 2021, 16thNovember 2021 and 22nd November 2021. On our direction, Respondent No.1 also filed anAdditional Affidavit dated 22 nd November 2021 placing on record the Reports of the TenderEvaluation Committee.30. On 10th December 2021, Mr. Venkatesh Dhond, Senior Advocate was appointed as AmicusCuriae in the matter. The Ld. Amicus Curiae has submitted a Note to assist this Court in the matter.31. The Petitioner and Respondent Nos. 3 also filed Written Submissions. The Advocate appearingfor Respondent No.2 stated that since he has filed a detailed reply, he is not desirous of filing anywritten submissions.32. We have heard the parties and the Amicus Curiae and perused the written submissions.M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/8PETITIONER'S SUBMISSIONS33. The Petitioner submits that the eligibility criteria in all subject tenders are clear. The subjecttenders clearly require the bidder to "furnish declaration that he has not been debarred fromtendering by any authority/agency". The criteria is general and not limited to any authority/ agency"of BARC". Petitioner submits that Respondent No.2 having been banned by NPCIL by its BanningOrder, could not have submitted such a declaration or participated in the subject tenders.Kanchan P Dhuri 14 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt34. The Petitioner contends that Respondent No.2 participated in the tender by playing a fraudupon Respondent No.1. It attempted to illegally circumvent the criteria by a clever use of words. Thedeclaration submitted by the Respondent No.2 to the effect that NPCIL had issued "notice forbanning business unilaterally" when, in fact, a Banning Order was passed, is false. By virtue ofsubmitting a false declaration, the Petitioner submits that Respondent No.2 is in violation of theconditions of the NIT.35. As to the correspondence exchanged by NPCIL with the Tender Portal, the Petitioner points outthat as on the date Respondent No.2 submitted its bid, the unit wise banning feature on the TenderWizard Portal was not in place. It is only after creating a fresh profile to bypass the restrictions onthe Tender Wizard Portal, that Respondent No.2 obtained a clarification from the Tender WizardPortal permitting it to do so. The Petitioner contends this is also a fraud.RESPONDENTS' SUBMISSIONS36. Respondent No.1 initially filed a detailed Affidavit, submitting that :(a) While the NIT requires that bidders submit a declaration to the effect that s/he has not beendebarred by any authority/ Agency, "there was no specified pre- bid condition or pre-qualificationcriteria regarding that, Firm-Company black-listed/ debarred/ or banned from any othergovernment establishment or institutions may having Kanchan P Dhuri 15 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odtdisqualification from submitting of bid."(b) Banning Order of NCPIL is not applicable to BARC.(c) Respondent No.2 has submitted the "desired declaration" in compliance of the NIT.37. Respondent No.1 also relied upon an office order issued by the Central Vigilance Commissionstating that banning of a business is an administrative matter to be decided by the management ofthe organisation. Respondent No.1 has produced the Department of Atomic Energy's own internalprocedure to ban/ debar contractors.38. The Advocate for Respondent No.2 submitted as follows:M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/9(a) That entire Petition suffers from grave delay and laches and therefore, ought not be allowed.(b) That Banning Order does not prevent Respondent No.2 from doing business with units otherthan NPCIL. Therefore, he submitted that the Banning Order does not render Respondent No.2ineligible to participate in the subject tenders.(c) That the Banning Order is not an order of "debarment". According to Respondent No.2, thetender criteria required a declaration to the effect that " he has not been debarred from tendering byany authority/agency". An Order of Banning is on a different footing and is not covered by thedeclaration.           (d)    As to the Petitioner's contention that a false declaration had been Kanchan P Dhuri                            16   / 25                         WP-6373-2021.odtsubmitted, Respondent No.2 submits that the use of the word "notice" instead of "order" in itsaforesaid declaration was inadvertent.(e) Advocate for Respondent No.2 also placed reliance upon the entire chronology of facts which ledto Respondent No.2 creating a fresh profile on the Tender Wizard Portal. The Ld. Advocate drew ourattention to the correspondence exchanged between NPCIL and the Tender Wizard Portal. Hesubmitted that the Banning Order applied only to NPCL. However, the Tender Wizard Portalwrongly blocked Respondent No.2 from bidding for any tender whatsoever. Respondent No.2 thuscontended that when this was pointed out, NPCIL itself wrote to the Tender Wizard Portalrequesting them to introduce a unit-wise banning feature. As such a feature was not yet available, bythe email dated 16 th September 2020, "DAE Support Desk" permitted it to create a fresh profile inorder participate in the subject tenders. According to Respondent No.2, this means that theDepartment of Atomic Energy (Respondent No.4) and NPCIL have itself permitted RespondentNo.2 to participate in the subject tenders.(f ) That Respondent No.2 is challenging the Banning Order, which is even otherwise malafide andbad in law. Respondent No.2 claims that the Banning Order is motivated by independent arbitralproceedings pending between NPCIL and Respondent No.2, where NPCIL has been directed todeposit monies.Kanchan P Dhuri 17 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt39. Apart from the above, Respondent No.2 took issue with the Petitioner's attempt to impugnvarious tenders that the Petitioner had not even bid for/ participated in. He contended that thePetitioner had no "locus" to do so.40. The Advocate for NPCIL, in response to Respondent No.2's contention that the Banning order isin substance different from an order of debarment, drew our attention to Clause 3.6 of NPCIL'sM/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/10policy, which clearly states that,-"3.6 Banning of Business Dealing- An Administrative penalty disqualifying a personor an entity from participating in any business process for a given period and shallinclude suspension, withholding, debarring, delisting, cooling periods, blacklisting ofbusiness dealings, holidaying or any other word/attribute inferring todiscontinuation of business relation in any form."41. The Advocate for Respondent No.3 therefore submitted that its Banning Order was in substancean order of debarment. Therefore, Respondent No.3 submitted that by virtue of the Banning Order,Respondent No.2 was "debarred from tendering by any authority/agency", and consequently, wasdisqualified from participating in the subject tenders.42. The Learned Addl. Solicitor General, who appeared for the Department of Atomic Energy(Respondent No.4, which is also the nodal agency of Respondent No.1) drew our attention to theAffidavit tendered by the Department of Atomic Energy. He clarified that an email from "DAESupport Desk" authorising Respondent Kanchan P Dhuri 18 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt No.2 to create afresh profile on the Tender Wizard Portal should not be viewed as an authorisation/ permissiongranted by the Department of Atomic Energy to Respondent No.2 to participate in the subjecttenders. "DAE Support Desk" is distinct from the Department of Atomic Energy. It is a helpdeskdeveloped by the Tender Wizard Portal, operated and maintained by Indian Telephone IndustriesLtd. "DAE Support Desk" is therefore a third party that monitors tenders issued by the Departmentof Atomic Energy on the Tender Wizard Portal and is not the same as the Department.43. At a subsequent hearing dated 24th January 2022, we recorded his fair statement that "the BriefNote prepared by the learned Senior Advocate Shri Dhond, appears to be fair and therefore, he relieson the same and is submitting to the orders of the Court."SUBMISSIONS OF THE AMICUS CURIAE44. The Amicus Curiae submitted that the Banning Order, for all intents and purposes was an Orderof 'debarment' and was required to be disclosed under the Tender. Thus, in light of the BanningOrder, Respondent No.2 had been "debarred from tendering by any authority/agency" andaccording to Clause 3(m) of the subject tenders, was ineligible to participate in the subject tenders.45. He submitted that Respondent No.2 in its declaration only stated that Kanchan P Dhuri 19 / 25WP-6373-2021.odt there was a "notice for banning of business with NPCIL", when, in fact, it wasaware that there was an "Order of" Banning. Further, Respondent No.2 had carefully avoidedmaking a declaration to the effect that it had "not been debarred from tendering by anyauthority/agency". Instead, Respondent No.2 added words of qualification and stated that it had notbeen debarred by "any authority/ agency of BARC-NRB". These words are absent in the tender.Thus, he submitted that not only was Respondent No.2's bid in violation of the eligibility criteriaunder Clause 3(m) of the tender, but the declaration submitted by Respondent No.2 was alsomisleading.M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/1146. He, therefore, submitted that Clause 7 of the eligibility criteria, which stated that a bidder wasliable for disqualification if he submitted a false declaration, was also attracted.47. He further submitted that Respondent No.2's submission that it was authorised to create a freshprofile on the Tender Wizard Portal, even if correct, would have no real bearing at all on the issue athand, which is whether or not Respondent No.2 is eligible to participate in the subject tenders. Theissue has to be determined solely with reference to Respondent No.1's own eligibility criteria andwhether they allowed a bidder who was banned/debarred by another agency to participate in thesubject tenders. Thus Mr. Dhond submitted that (i) the fact the terms of the Banning Orderrestricted the ban on Respondent No.2 solely to NPCIL tenders and (ii) that Kanchan P Dhuri 20 /25 WP-6373-2021.odt NPCIL accordingly requested the Tender Wizard Portal not to impose ablanket ban on Respondent No.2 from participating in government tenders, have no bearing on theissue at hand.REASONS AND FINDINGS:48. The requirements in a tender notice can be classified into two categories--those which lay down the essential conditions of eligibility and the others which are merelyancillary or subsidiary with the main object to be achieved by the condition. In the first case theauthority issuing the tender may be required to enforce them rigidly. In the other cases it may beopen to the authority to deviate from and not to insist upon the strict literal compliance of thecondition in appropriate cases.49. First and foremost, Clause 3(m) of the subject tender requires Respondent No.2 to submit adeclaration to the effect that it has "not been debarred from tendering by any authority/agency".Clause 3(m) is one amongst a list of 'Initial Eligibility Criteria" which open with the phrase "thebidder should have the following". Clause 9 of the tender states the documents relating to theeligibility criteria will be evaluated, and the financial bid of only those bidders whose documentsrelating to the eligibility criteria are found to be satisfactory will be opened. Clause 34 reiterates that"documents related to the eligibility criteria will be evaluated and accordingly tenderers will bequalified".Kanchan P Dhuri 21 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt50. From a reading of the subject tenders therefore, we find that Clause 3(m) of the tender is anessential condition of the tender which goes to root of the eligibility of persons who make offersunder the tender.51. It is well settled in law that an essential condition of a tender has to be strictly complied with. Wefind that the natural and obvious corollary of Clause 3(m) of the tender is that a bidder who hasbeen "debarred from tendering by any authority/agency" is liable to be rejected straightaway.M/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/1252. The only question that arises, therefore, is whether Respondent No.2 is in violation of Clause3(m) of the subject tenders.53. We reject the contention taken by Respondent No.1 in its Reply Affidavit that the tendercondition merely required a declaration to be submitted, and so long as the "desired declaration"was submitted, whether or not a bidder was actually debarred is irrelevant. That would render theeligibility criteria of the tender completely redundant. It would tantamount to placing a premium ondishonesty. Indeed, no purpose whatsoever will be served by asking bidders to disclose whether ornot they are debarred, if the consequence is that even those making false declarations are eligible toparticipate in the tender.54. Similarly, we are unable to accept the contention that the Banning Order has no effect on theeligibility of Respondent No.2, as it is not an order of debarment. We find that the Banning Orderwas nothing but an order of debarment. This is Kanchan P Dhuri 22 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odtapparent from the words of the Banning Order itself, which states that "the committee [of NPCIL]has taken unanimous decision for 'debarring you/your firm" from dealing any kinds of business withthe 'Corporation' for the period of two years in public interest." It is also evident from the policy ofNPCIL to which the Advocate for Respondent No. 3 drew our attention, which treats debarment and"or any other word/attribute inferring to discontinuation of business relation in any form" as oneand the same.55. Turning next, to the contention that the Banning Order applies only to NPCIL, we are of theconsidered view that what is really relevant is the requirements of the subject tender. What is ofimportance is that the subject tenders themselves require that Respondent No.2 "has not beendebarred from tendering by any authority/agency". It is not in dispute that by virtue of the BanningOrder, Respondent No.2 has been so debarred. Once the factum of debarring is established, the factof debarring would operate to make Respondent No.2 ineligible to participate in the subject tenderon the basis of the tender terms. In such circumstances, the inevitable conclusion that follows is thatRespondent No.2's bids are in violation of Clause 3(m) of the tender and are liable to be rejected asineligible.56. We find that the Tender Evaluation Committee of the BARC, in its Report dated 28th December,2020 in respect of the 1st Tender, has not considered these aspects before concluding thatRespondent No.2 is a "qualified" bidder. In so far as the 2nd tender is concerned, the TenderEvaluation Committee of the BARC Kanchan P Dhuri 23 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt recommended thatRespondent No.2 is qualified for participation in opening Financial Bids "subject to acceptance ofdebar document by Competent Authority". Thus, even according to Respondent No.1, the BanningOrder was extremely relevant. However, in spite of these observations, Respondent No.1 eventuallydecided to award the 2 nd tender to the Respondent No.2.57. The next submission raised was that the Writ is delayed. Respondent No.2 submits that althoughthe Work Order in respect of the 1 st tender was awarded on 5th March 2021, the Writ Petition wasfiled on 2 nd September 2021. We do not find any undue delay in the present case, especially in lightof the circumstances including the second wave of COVID-19 prevailing in early 2021. Moreover, inM/S Raut Enterprises vs Bhabha Atomic Research Centre And ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/170342978/13light of our categorical findings that the work orders that have been awarded to Respondent No.2are ex-facie in violation of the tender conditions, even if there is a slight delay, we find that it is notfatal to the Petition being entertained.58. We also reject the submission that we must not interfere with those tenders where the Petitioneris not a competing bidder. At any rate, in light of our finding that the tenders have been awarded/work orders been issued in contravention of essential conditions in the tender, we cannot allow suchillegalities to stand on the basis of a mere technicality.59. The next question that we must consider is how Respondent No.2 came to create a new Profileon the Tender Wizard Platform. We find that this need not Kanchan P Dhuri 24 / 25WP-6373-2021.odt detain us at all. The question before us is whether Respondent No.2's bid waseligible in light of the tender conditions. We have already noted that in light of the plain language ofthe subject tenders, we cannot but conclude that the bid was ineligible. In the circumstances, howand in what manner Respondent No.2 submitted the bid and whether it did so with the blessings ofNPCIL has no bearing on the lis before us.60. Similarly, Respondent No.1's reliance on its own internal procedure on when a bidder may bebanned is not germane to the issue at hand. The issue at hand is not whether Respondent No.1 hasbanned Respondent No.2, but whether Respondent No.2 is eligible to participate in the subjecttenders, despite having been banned by another agency, in the context of the specific terms of theBARC tender itself.61. In light of our findings above, we come to the question of what reliefs the Petitioner is entitled to.The subject tenders before us are of two varieties. The first group, enlisted in Para 1 of our Orderand prayer clauses (b), (c) and (c-1), are those where the decision to award the tender to RespondentNo.2 has already been made. As far as the first group is concerned, we have already found thatRespondent No.2's bid was in violation of the tender condition. In the circumstances, we quash andset aside the decision of the Respondent No.1 to award the aforesaid tenders to Respondent No.2.This Writ Petition is allowed in terms of prayer clauses (b), (c) and (c-1) above. However, we clarifythat Respondent No.2 is at liberty to award the tenders to any other bidder and/or to issue a freshnotice inviting tender.Kanchan P Dhuri 25 / 25 WP-6373-2021.odt62. As far as the second group of tenders at Para 2 of our Order and prayer clause (c-2) is concerned,it is an admitted position that these tenders are yet to be opened and awarded. We find it entirelypremature at this stage to pass any Orders in respect of the tenders. We find no reason to presumethat Respondent No.1 will not evaluate the bids in accordance with law and the tender conditionsthemselves. Thus, we find no reason to grant any reliefs in terms of prayer clause (c-2). We clarifythat the Petitioner is at liberty to file appropriate proceedings as and when the tenders are openedand the bids are awarded, if the need arises.63.
