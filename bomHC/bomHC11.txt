The learned Additional Sessions Judge, after appreciating the evidence of prosecutionwitnesses 6 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors and defence and considering the argument advancedby the learned A.P.P. and defence counsel, was pleased to hold accused No. 1/Achyut guilty for theoffence punishable under sections 304B and 498A read with section 34 of IPC and sentenced him toundergo life imprisonment for the offence punishable under section 304B and to pay fine of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand), in default of payment of fine, to suffer rigorous imprisonment forsix months and to pay fine of Rs. 2,000/- (Rupees Two Thousand) and also convicted him for theoffence punishable under section 498A of IPC and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonmentfor six months and to pay fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to suffer rigorousimprisonment for one month.(j) Accused Nos. 2 to 4 came to be acquitted of the charge of dowry death punishable under section304B read with section 34 of IPC.

Perused the evidence produced by prosecution agency as well as defence with able assistance oflearned A.P.P. and learned counsel for the appellant.7 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors Argument of learned counsel for the appellant/accused.Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/46. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel for the appellant/accused submitted that the prosecution case isbased upon circumstantial evidence. There is no direct evidence to prove the alleged charges levelledagainst the accused. He vehemently submitted that late Sunita was never subjected to harassmentand cruelty to satisfy unlawful demand of gold ring and cash amount. It is afterthought storyprojected by the prosecution by taking undue advantage of unfortunate death of Sunita. Noindependent witness is coming forth to support case of prosecution that deceased Sunita wassubjected to harassment and cruelty at the hands of the accused for the unlawful demand of dowry.He submitted that marriage of Sunita was solemnized against her wish and she was not happy withaccused No. 1/Achyut. He submitted that there was delay of one day in lodging of FIR. That itselfshows cooked story narrated in the FIR to book the accused.7. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel submitted that at the time of alleged incident, accused No. 1/Achyutwas at work place Thergaon in Pune District. He was not at Dhanegaon. After receiving message onphone, he rushed to village Dhanegaon. Accused No. 1 has been falsely implicated in this case.Accused Nos. 2 to 4 were behaving with Sunita in a very good manner and Sunita never complainedagainst them. So far as alleged unlawful demand of dowry is concerned and fulfillment thereof, nomeeting between the families, much less about the alleged harassment 8 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 &2 Ors which was caused to Sunita. It speaks that Sunita was never subjected to harassment andcruelty to fulfill unlawful demand of dowry. She was treated nicely by her husband and in-laws.8. Mr Chatterji, the learned counsel took us through the evidence of P.W. No. 1 - Deepak MadhukarLondhe, Exh. 22, P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai Madhukar Londhe Exh. 23, P.W. No. 4 - Manik AbasahebGhadge, Exh. 46 and P.W. No. 6 - Rupesh Madhukar Londhe, Exh. 52.9. Mr Chatterji, the learned counsel pointed out how the evidence of above said witnesses is fellingshort to prove the offence of dowry death as well as offence under section 498A of IPC. Mr Chatterji,learned counsel also invited our attention to the evidence of three defence witnesses examined bythe accused viz. D.W. No. 1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh, Exh. 79, D.W. No. 2 - Santosh Shahaji Kale, Exh.80 and D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Bharat Raut, Exh. 83 who is resident of same locality of Dhanegaonwhere accused reside. Evidence of D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Raut, Exh. 83 discloses that marriage ofSunita was solemnized with accused No. 1 against her wish. He further submitted that evidence ofD.W. No. 2 - Santosh Kale Exh. 80 discloses that at the time of alleged incident, accused No. 1 -Achyut was at Thergaon and busy in his work. The evidence of D.W. No. 1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh,Exh. 79 speaks that he had heard from Sunita that her marriage was performed with accused No. 1 -Achyut against her will.9 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors10. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel vehemently submitted that the learned trial Judge has committedan error on facts in convicting husband/ Achyut under section 304B of I.P.C. and all accused undersection 498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. There is no sufficient evidence to arrive at such positiveconclusion. The learned trial Judge has not considered the defence evidence in a proper perspectiveand not given equal treatment like prosecution witnesses. Mr Chatterji submitted that accusedAchyut/husband needs to be free from the charge under section 304B of I.P.C. as well as all theAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/5accused persons/in-laws under section 498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. There is no merit in theappeal for enhancement moved by the State as well as appeal against the acquittal of originalaccused Nos. 2 to 3 from the charge under section 304B of I.P.C. in view of above submissions madeby him.11. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel for the appellants has placed his reliance on the following stock ofcitations in support of his argument :-(i) Tomaso Bruno and Another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2015) 7 SCC 178(ii) Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Haryana reported in (2010) 12 SCC 350(iii) Jumni and others Vs. State of Haryana reported in (2014) 11 SCC 355(iv) Arvind Singh Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2001) 6 SCC407.10 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors12. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel for the appellant/accused by way of alternative submissions, urgedthat the sentence awarded against the appellant/accused husband Achyut may be reduced to 10years for the offence punishable under section 304B of I.P.C. without disturbing the sentence passedagainst all the accused under section 498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. in view of the peculiar factsof the case on hand by placing his reliance on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court(Criminal Appeal No. 135/2014 with connected appeal) to which one of us was party (V.K. Jadhav,J.).13. Per contra, Mrs P.V. Diggikar, learned A.P.P. for the State forcefully submitted that death ofdeceased - Sunita is within seven years of her marriage and soon before her death, she was subjectedto harassment and cruelty to meet unlawful demand of dowry and it was unnatural death.Therefore, presumption under section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act comes into picture. Theprosecution has proved the offences against the accused by producing cogent and impeachable pieceof evidence. The witnesses have categorically stated in respect of harassment and cruelty to lateSunita to meet unlawful demand of dowry in a cohesive manner. She submitted that the accusedwere absent from the scene. It is brought on record through the evidence of Doctor that the deceasedhas resisted the assault, and therefore, her fingers and nails were blueished which speaks thataccused had assaulted the deceased. The conduct of the accused needs to be taken into account.They did not inform to the Police and even to the relatives of the deceased soon after the incident.They did not lodge any report. All these facts lead to the 11 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Orsconclusion that death was caused due to throttling when Sunita was in the custody of the accused.She was pregnant and hoping dream of happy life after birth of a child. Her sudden death has causedshock and mental agony to the parents of deceased.Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/614. Mrs Diggikar, learned A.P.P. submitted that Sunita met with unnatural death in the matrimonialhouse. No explanation is coming forth from the side of the accused as contemplated under section106 of the Indian Evidence Act, as to how the incident had occurred. She submitted that eventhough there are minor inconsistencies in the evidence of related witnesses, not any way fatal to theprosecution. The evidence of prosecution witnesses is consistent, coherent and compact.15. Mrs P.V. Diggikar, learned counsel submitted that the learned trial Judge has convictedaccused/Achyut (husband) of the deceased under section 304B of I.P.C. but acquitted remainingthree accused persons/ in-laws without assigning any sufficient reasons. The error on the factscommitted by the learned trial Judge needs to be corrected by this court by allowing the appealpreferred by the State against the acquittal of original accused Nos. 2 to 4. It is a case of dowry deathunder section 304B of I.P.C. The deceased Sunita was residing in the matrimonial house. At the timeof incident, accused and her in-laws were present. Sunita was subjected to cruelty and harassmentto meet unlawful demand of dowry soon before her death and as such, all of them need to beconvicted under section 304B of I.P.C. In view of evidence produced by the prosecution machinery,original accused Nos. 2 to 4 need not be given 12 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors differenttreatment on the same set of evidence and facts.16. Mrs Diggikar, learned A.P.P. for the State invited our attention to the sentence awarded by thelearned trial Judge against all the accused under section 498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. Shesubmitted that the sentence awarded by the learned trial Judge against the accused under section498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. is very much low having regard to the nature of offence. It is anoffence against the society and no leniency should be shown to such culprits by awarding lessorpunishment. She urged that the appeal preferred by the State for enhancement of sentence may beallowed and appropriate sentence may be awarded against all the accused under section 498A readwith section 34 of I.P.C.17. To buttress the argument, Mrs Diggikar, learned A.P.P. for the State has placed her reliance onfollowing bunch of citations :-(i) Trimukh Maroti Kirkan Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 2006 AIR SCW 5300(ii) Davinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in 2014 Cri.L.J. 4065 (SC)(iii) Harku Vs.

No. 2 - Santosh Shahaji Kale vide Exh. 80              (colleague of accused No.1)(iii)         D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Bharat Raut vide Exh. 83              (resident of same locality of Gharkul)Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/925. It is necessary to look into the medical evidence in order to find out whether Sunita met withunnatural death though not much disputed by the defence side.26. P.W. No. 8 - Dr. Yuvraj Kharade, vide Exh. 57 is a Medical Officer, who has conductedpostmortem examination along with Dr. Sanju 16 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors Mundhe on thedead body of Sunita on 04.03.2012. His evidence discloses that he has noticed the injuries asdescribed in column No. 17 of the postmortem report. There were abrasion over lenier aspect oftongue, CLW over lower lip 2 X 2 cm inner aspect, finger or thumb nail mark over left and right sideof midline of neck 2 X .2 cm., nail mark over hyorid valve vertical line 2 X .02 cm., bruises below leftand right eye 2 X .2 cm., bruises over right cheek 3 X 3 cm. He stated that all injuries wereantemortem. He further disclosed that when he opened trakia, he noticed echymosis (blood block)over neck muscle due to the throttling the said impact is noticed. Both hands/finger bluish andflexed which indicates that deceased was defending assault before her death. Eyes were closed, pupilsemi-dilated fixed and not reacting to light, tongue was present inside mouth. Blood coming throughright side of mouth. Redish is discharged through nostrils. The uterus congested and contentsyoulksac and fetal poll and it was 10 weeks pregnancy. There was no smelling to the contents ofpoison found in the stomach. According to the opinion expressed by Dr. Yuvraj kharade and agreedby Dr. Sanju Mundhe that death of deceased was due to throttling as per the observations made inthe post mortem report and opinion given in the provisional cause of death certificate vide Exh.59and post mortem report vide Exh. 58.27. Dr. Yujraj Kharade has disagreed with the suggestions given by the defence in thecross-examination that a person affected by mental disorder if in the said inflection of throttlinghimself may result injuries as described in column No. 17 of the post mortem report. As such, thatpossibility has been ruled out in unambiguous words by Dr. Yuvraj 17 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2Ors Kharade. It was attempted by the defence to show that though dead body was brought in thehospital during night by the Police at 12.00 midnight, the post mortem was conducted on next dayand there was delay in postmortem examination. The key of the room where the dead body waskept, was with the Police. There is medical protocol for conducting post mortem examination in amedico legal case. The Government doctors need to follow the medical protocol and circulars andthe guidelines issued by the Government from time to time. Therefore, we do not find any force inthat contentions raised by the defence side.28. Having regard to the medical evidence discussed above, it is very much clear that Sunita metwith unnatural death within two years from the date of her marriage. It is not disputed by thedefence that Sunita was found dead in her matrimonial house at Dhanegaon. In that background, itis very much necessary to see the essential ingredients of section 304-B of I.P.C.29. Section 304B was incorporated in the I.P.C. by the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986(Act 43 of 1986). In case of Preet Pal Singh Vs. State of U.P. and Anr. reported in 2021 (4) Mh.L.J.Cri. 509, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under :-Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/1028. Section 304B was incorporated in the Indian Penal Code by the DowryProhibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (Act 43 of 1986). The object of the amendmentwas to curb dowry death. Section 304B does not categorize death, it covers every kindof death that occurs otherwise than in normal circumstances. Where the otheringredients of Section 304B of the Code are satisfied, the 18 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14& 2 Ors deeming fiction of Section 304B would be attracted and the husband or therelatives shall be deemed to have caused the death of the bride.29. The essential ingredients for attraction of Section 304B are:(i) the death of woman must have been caused in unnatural circumstances.(ii) the death should have occurred within 7 years of marriage.(iii) Soon before her death the woman must have been subjected to cruelty orharassment by her husband or his relatives and such cruelty or harassment must befor or in connection with the demand for dowry, and such cruelty or harassment isshown to have been meted out to the woman soon before her death.30. The legislative intent of incorporating section 304-B was to curb the menace of dowry death witha firm hand. In dealing with the cases under section 304-B, the legislative intent must be kept inmind. Once there is material to show that the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment beforedeath, there is a presumption of dowry death and the onus is on the accused in-laws to showotherwise.31. The evidence of P.W. No. 1 - Deepak Madhukar Londhe (brother of the deceased) vide Exh.22,P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai Madhukar Londhe vide Exh. 29 (mother of deceased), P.W. No. 4, ManikAbasaheb Ghadge vide Exh. 54, (relative of accused) and P.W. No. 6 - Rupesh Madhukar Londhevide Exh.52 (another brother of deceased) are the important witnesses. In order to find out whetherthe deceased Sunita was 19 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors subjected to harassment and cruelty tomeet the unlawful demand of dowry soon before her death.32. On perusing the record and proceedings more particularly, the occurrence report and Khabarvide Exh.48 and 49 and AD report vide Exh. 50, it is noticed that one Mr Ashok Chavan, Police Patilof village Dhanegaon has informed the Police that deceased Sunita died after consuming poison. Onthat basis, AD report vide Exh. 56 has been registered. However, that reporting by Police Patil aboutdeath of Sunita by consuming poison appears to be factually incorrect in view of medical evidenceproduced by the prosecution agency through P.W. No. 8 Dr. Yuvraj Kharade. P.W. No. 8, Dr. YuvrajKharade has stated in unambiguous words that it was not a case of death by poisoning. It was a caseof death by throttling. As such, no more weightage can be given to khabar given by village PolicePatil.33. The testimony of P.W. No. 1 - Deepak Londhe (brother of the deceased and first informant)reveals that deceased was cohabiting in house of accused Nos. 1 to 4, who were residing jointly. TheyAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/11had given dowry of Rs. 1,00,000/- and two tola gold to the accused in marriage of Sunita, but theywere not satisfied. Accused started demanding cash amount and gold ring. Whenever Sunita used tovisit her parents house, she was complaining about the harassment and cruelty, which was beingcaused to her at the hands of accused to meet their unlawful demand of cash amount and gold. Hehas further disclosed that after first festival of Gudi Padva, when he visited the house of Sunita, allthe accused made 20 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors demand of gold ring and also abused Sunitain his presence. He tried to convince to the accused that they have spent huge amount in themarriage and unable to satisfy the demand. However, attitude of the accused was not changed. Healso disclosed about one incident when deceased was residing along with her husband andsister-in-law Satyashila at Pune when they tried to set Sunita on fire, but there was no complaint.After that incident, all of them came back to Dhanegaon and started residing there. He has disclosedthat accused were giving mental and physical torture to deceased Sunita. It is further evidence ofP.W. No. 1 - Deepak Londhe that before 10 to 15 days of the incident, his mother along with anotherbrother (P.W. No. 6 - Rupesh Madhukar Londhe) had been to the matrimonial house of Sunita. Hehas disclosed that accused Nos. 2 and 4 scolded his mother and stated that what would happen ifSunita would be killed. They would perform second marriage of accused No. 1 Achyut and theywould get more amount. As such, mother of Sunita became afraid and requested Sunita toaccompany her. But Sunita refused to join her on the pretext that she was pregnant and after herdelivery, things would be alright and after 10 to 15 days, death of Sunita had taken place.34. P.W. No. 1- Deepak Londhe was tried to be questioned on account of not lodging any complaintwith the Police about harassment and cruelty which was being extended to the deceased Sunita. Wecannot overlook that in matrimonial cases, parties do not want to rush to the Police Station. There isalways apprehension that if the matter is reported to the Police, the family relations would bespoiled. As such, the testimony 21 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors of P.W. No. 1 - Deepak Londhecannot be doubted only because, he or his family members did not lodge any complaint against theaccused at the relevant point of time though Sunita was subjected to harassment and cruelty to meetthe unlawful demand of money and gold ring. The defence has further attempted to establish thatthe marriage of Sunita was solemnized with accused No.1 against her wish and she was not happy.No such material is coming forth through the cross-examination of P.W.No. 1 - Deepak Londhe tosupport that line of defence. On careful scrutiny of the evidence of P.W. No. 1 -Deepak, it is foundthat his evidence is trustworthy and reliable. He has disclosed in clear words that his sister Sunitawas subjected to harassment and cruelty at the hands of her husband and in-laws to meet unlawfuldemand of money and gold ring soon before her death. He has disclosed in detail and supported tothe narration given in the FIR which is vide Exh. at 24.35. Now, coming to P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai Madhukar Londhe (mother of the deceased). Herevidence is supporting to P. W. No. 1 - Deepak. She has corroborated the testimony of her sonDeepak by stating all the details as to how her daughter Sunita was subjected to harassment andcruelty at the hands of her husband and in-laws to meet the unlawful demand of money and goldring. She has disclosed that her daughter Sunita was subjected to beating and harassment forbringing less amount of dowry in the marriage. She has even disclosed about her visit to Sunita'smatrimonial house just 8 days prior to the incident. She has disclosed that mother-in-law andsister-in-law of Sunita asked her as to what would happen if they would kill Sunita. They wouldAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/12perform second 22 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors marriage of Achyut and may get enough dowryamount. P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai apprehended danger to the life of her daughter Sunita and askedSunita to accompany her. But Sunita refused to join her as she was pregnant. After 8 days, Sunitamet with unnatural death in her matrimonial house. By way of cross-examination, she has admittedthat the family of the accused is financially sound whereas economical condition of her family isweak. That admission is not any way helpful to the defence in absence of any further material so asto discard the evidence of P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai, who has stated in detail about harassment andcruelty caused to her daughter Sunita for unlawful demand of money soon before her death at thehands of accused. The testimony of P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai is found consistent with the testimony ofP.W. No. 1 - Deepak and goes hand in hand.36. P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge vide Exh.46 happened to be relative of the accused. He was presentat the time of settlement of marriage between Achyut and Sunita as well as present at the time ofwedding and at the time of funeral of Sunita. The testimony of P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge istherefore, important and crucial for both the sides. On perusing the testimony of P. W. No. 4 -Manik Ghadge, it is evident that marriage of Sunita was solemnized with accused No. 1 on08.03.2010 as per tradition. In the said marriage, dowry of Rs.1,00,000/- and two tolas gold wasgiven to the accused. Sunita went to matrimonial house after the marriage and started cohabiting atvillage Dhanegaon. She was residing with her husband - Achyut, parents, in-laws Shakuntala,Bhaskar and sister in-law Satyashila. He was asking to Muktabai P.W. No. 2 (mother of 23CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors the deceased) about the married life of Sunita and came to knowthat accused were harassing to Sunita and she was subjected to cruelty and ill treatment to meet thedemand of money and gold. He was also asking Sunita on phone about her married life and came toknow that Sunita was subjected to harassment at the hands of the accused to bring Rs. 1,00,000/-and gold ring. She was subjected to beating at the hands of the accused. He has also disclosed aboutone incident occurred at Pune when Sunita was residing with her husband and sister-in-law. It wasan attempt to set Sunita ablaze after pouring kerosene, but she rescued herself. He has furtherdisclosed that even after returning back to Dhanegaon from Pune, the accused continued theirharassment and ill treatment to Sunita to fulfill demand of gold and money. He has also disclosedthat he himself with other relatives held meeting with accused and persuaded them to stop suchkind of cruelty and harassment to Sunita. He has also disclosed about the incident occurred just 8days prior to the incident when Sunita's mother - Muktabai had been to her house and alsocorroborated the version of P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai. He has further disclosed that he came to knowfrom P.W. No. 1 - Deepak Londhe about death of Sunita on 03.03.2012 and he rushed to Dhanegaonwith his relatives. He noticed that Sunita was lying dead in the house and there were scratches onher neck, hairs were scattered.37. While facing cross-examination, P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge has admitted that there was adiscussion about the death of Sunita amongsts themselves and they suspected that accused areresponsible for death of Sunita and they went to Jamkhed Police Station along with 25 24CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors to 50 relatives when Deepak Londhe lodged the FIR. Theseadmissions are not any way sufficient to discard the testimony of P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge. It isobvious that when unnatural death takes place in the family and that too a newly married daughter,the relatives and family members would sit together and discuss. It is natural phenomenon and itAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/13cannot be said to be plan to implicate the accused in a case.38. It was attempted to show P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge could not tell month and year when Sunitadisclosed him about her harassment at the hands of the accused. He did not lodge complaint againstthe accused when he came to know about ill treatment caused to Sunita. Again, these answers arenot any way fatal to take doubt on the testimony of P.W. No. 4- Manik Ghadge. He is a witness right from the settlement of marriage up to the wedding playedrole. He is relative of both the sides. There is no enmity between the family of accused and thiswitness P. W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge. There is no reason for P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge to deposeagainst the accused. The testimony of P.W. No. 4 - Manik Ghadge appears to be trustworthy andreliable.39. P.W. No. 6 - Rupesh Londhe is another brother of the deceased. He has also corroborated thetestimony of P.W. No. 1 - Deepak and PW2 - Muktabai. He is a witness, who accompanied hismother Muktabai, who visited house of Sunita just 8 to 10 days before the death of Sunita. In theearlier part of his testimony, he has also stated that all the accused persons started harassment andill treatment to his sister Sunita on account of short amount of dowry and gold quantity. So far asthe 25 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors incident prior to 8 to 10 days of the death of Sunita, he hascategorically stated what had happened and narrated by his mother P.W. No. 2 - Muktabai. He hasdisclosed in the same words as to how accused Shakuntala and accused Satyashila behaved withthem and threatened to kill Sunita. He has also disclosed about the incident which had occurred atPune when Sunita was attempted to set her on fire. The testimony of P.W. No. 6 - Rupesh is put toquestion that he did not go personally to Pune and his version on the point of incident of settingSunita on fire appears to be hearsay. Even if we discard that piece of evidence, we cannot discard hisentire testimony. His evidence on the point of harassment and cruelty caused by the accused justbefore 8 to 10 days of the incident is found trustworthy and goes hand in hand with the version ofP.W. No. 2 - Muktabai when both of them had been to the house of Sunita.40. It was attempted by the defence to show that till funeral of Sunita, no complaint was lodgedagainst the accused about ill treatment and cruelty to Sunita to meet unlawful demand. The FIRcame to be lodged after one day, and after discussion with the family members. Sunita met withunnatural death on 03.03.2012 and FIR came to be lodged on 04.03.2012 after the funeral. Themental condition of family members need to be considered. They had lost their dear daughter withintwo years of her marriage. Certainly, they must be under shock and grief. It cannot be any waytermed as unnatural conduct on the part of the family of deceased to lodge the FIR after the funeral.There is absolutely no delay in lodging of FIR in the set of facts and circumstances of the case inhand.26 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors41. Upon careful scrutiny of the evidence above referred, four important witnesses examined by theprosecution, it is very much clear that deceased Sunita was subjected to harassment and cruelty atthe hands of her husband and in-laws to meet unlawful demand of dowry and gold soon before herAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/14death. Sunita met with unnatural death in matrimonial house within two years from the date of hermarriage. Certainly, the presumption under section 113-B of the Evidence Act would come intopicture. In case of Davinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab (supra), it is held by the Hon'ble SupremeCourt that if death of a married woman had taken place within seven years of marriage due to burninjuries and not in normal circumstances, the presumption under section 11-B of the Evidence Actwould come into picture.42. The conjoint reading of section 113-B of the Evidence Act and section 304-B of the I.P.C. showsthat there must be material to show that soon before her death, the victim was subjected to crueltyor harassment. The prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death so asto bring it within the purview of "death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances". Theexpression "soon before" is very relevant where section 113-B of the Evidence Act and section 304Bof I.P.C. are pressed into service.43. Having regard to the above provisions, if evidence of above referred four material witnesses istaken into account, the prosecution has been successful in proving that deceased Sunita wassubjected to cruelty and harassment at the hands of the accused to meet unlawful demand of 27CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors money and gold soon before her death and she met with unnaturaldeath within two years from the date of marriage. Her unnatural death took place in thematrimonial house when she was cohabiting with the husband and in-laws. Therefore, presumptionavailable under section 113-B of the Evidence Act needs to be invoked in this case against theaccused.44. Now coming to evidence of defence witnesses examined by the accused.45. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel for the appellant/accused submitted that defence witnesses areentitled to get equal treatment with those of the prosecution witnesses by placing reliance in case ofJumni and others Vs. State of Haryana (supra). In case of Jumni and others Vs. State of Haryana,the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the approach of the court should not be such as to pickholes in defence case. The defence evidence should be tested like any other testimony, alwayskeeping in mind that a person is presumed innocent until found guilty.46. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated its view taken in Jayantibhai Bhenkarbhai Vs. Stateof Gujarat reported in (2002) 8 SCC 165, wherein it is held as under :-23. On the standard of proof, it was held in Mohinder Singh vs. State that thestandard of proof in regard to a plea of alibi must be the same as the standard appliedto the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable standard.Dudh Nath Pandy goes a step further and seeks to bury the ghost of disbelief thatshadows alibi witnesses, in the following words: (Dudh Nath case, SCC p. 173, para19) 28 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors "19....Defence witnesses are entitled to equaltreatment with those of the prosecution. And, courts, ought to overcome theirtraditional, instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often, they tell lies but sodo the prosecution witnesses."Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/15In view of the legal position made clear by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, certainly, wehave to give equal treatment to the witnesses examined by the defence by applyingreasonable standard.47 D.W. No. 1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh seems to be an agricultural labour working in the field ofaccused. He stated that he had an occasion to talk with Sunita. He had heard from Sunita once thather marriage with Accused/Achyut Kale was performed against her will. This piece of evidence ofD.W. No. 1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh, if assessed carefully, the first question comes, how Sunita, a ladymember of the family could tell such family matters to agricultural labour working in her field. He isthat way an outsider for the family. The married lady would tell about her indoor things to a personwho could be close to her and not outsider, who is an agricultural labour. By applying reasonablestandard and common prudence that piece of evidence of D.W. No.1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh appearsto be unworthy of credence.48. He has further disclosed that on 03.03.2012 at about 2.00 p.m. he had been to the shop of oneKale to purchase bidi when he noticed that Sunita was talking with a person, who came onmotorbike. He asked to Sunita, who is that person with whom she is talking. She has replied thatsaid person is from her maternal village. Again the version of D.W. No. 1 -29 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors Rashid Chand Shaikh appears to be unreliable if reasonablestandard is applied. D.W. No. 1 Rashid Chand Shaikh is not a family member and as such, he had noreason to ask any question to Sunita in this regard. The testimony of D.W. No. 1 - Rashid ChandShaikh is also questioned whether he is a resident of Dhanegaon in absence of any documentaryevidence. He has also admitted that he has not narrated said fact to her parents that Sunitainformed him that her marriage was performed with accused No.1/Achyut against her will. It raisesserious doubt about his credibility. We are not convinced to accept the testimony of D.W. No. 1 -Rashid Chand Shaikh.49. Now coming to evidence of D.W. No. 2 - Santosh Shahaji Kale. He stated that on 03.03.2012 i.e.on the date of incident, he along with accused No. 1/Achyut were installing advertisement board andhoarding at Thergaon. After returning to the home, Achyut received a phone from Laxman Kale ofDhanegaon that his wife Sunita is suffering from illness and he should start immediately.Accordingly, he along with accused No.1/ Achyut and other friends left by private vehicle andreached to Dhanegaon at about 5.00 p.m. in the next day morning.50. It is brought on record through the cross-examination of D.W. No. 2 - Santosh Kale that nodocumentary evidence is produced by this witness in order to corroborate his version that both ofthem were working together and on the date of incident, they were at Thergaon and busy in theirwork. There is no document to show that accused No.1/Achyut was assisting in his work at Pune. Inview of that quality of evidence of D.W.30 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors No. 2 - Santosh Kale, it would not be safe to rely upon that kindof evidence.Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/1651. D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Raut is stated to be neighbour of accused and resident of same Gharkullocality. She has stated that on the last Sankrat festival, Sunita has informed her that her marriagewas performed with accused No.1/Achyut against her will. The same question poses, how themarried lady could tell her indoor things to an outsider, who has no concern with her family. Assuch, that piece of evidence of D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Raut cannot be believable. She has furtherdisclosed that on 03.03.2012 i.e. on the date of incident, she had seen Sunita while talking with aperson of about 25-30 years of age and heard that said person was telling Sunita, Chal-chal, andthereafter, they went to Gharkul. This evidence of D.W. No. 3 - Tarabai Raut is found inconsistentwith the evidence of D.W. No. 1 - Rashid Chand Shaikh. According to D.W. No.1 - Rashid ChandShaikh, he noticed Sunita while talking with a person near the shop of one Kale whereas this D.W.No. 3 - Tarabai Raut is stating that she had seen deceased Sunita while talking with a person nearher house. There is no connecting evidence that shop of Kale and house of Sunita and this witnessTarabai Raut are close so that they could witness the things. On careful scrutiny of evidence of D.W.No. 3 - Tarabai Raut, her testimony is found unworthy credence. She is found to be a brought upwitness.52. Having regard to the appreciation of above referred three defence witnesses, it is clear that noneof the witnesses examined by 31 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors defence side are reliable andtrustworthy. Their evidence is unworthy of credence and cannot be acted upon.53. P.W. No. 5 - Mir Khan Pathan vide Exh. 47 is an author of A.D. lodged by village Police Patil MrAshok Chavan of Dhanegaon. P.W. No. 9- Raghunath Nachan vide Exh. 58 is a A.P.I./Investigating Officer. He has stated about hisprocedural part of investigation and filing of charge sheet in view of the incriminating evidencecollected against the accused.54. In case of Tomaso Bruno and Anr. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (supra), it is held by the Hon'bleSupreme Court that the presumption under section 114 of the Evidence Act is only permissibleinference and not a necessary inference. In every case based upon circumstantial evidence, thequestion that needs to be determined whether the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution areproved by reliable and cogent evidence and whether all the links in the chain of circumstance arecomplete so as to rule out the possibility of innocence of the accused. The conviction can be basedsolely on the circumstantial evidence, but it should be tested on the touchstone of the law relating tothe circumstantial evidence.55. In the above cited case, the CCTV footage and call records which was the best of piece ofevidence was withheld by the prosecution, therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased todraw an adverse inference against prosecution in view of section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act, 1872and pleased to acquit the accused from the charge of murder under section 302 of I.P.C. The facts ofthe cited case and the facts of the 32 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors case in hand are quitedistinguishable.Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/1756. In the case in hand, the prosecution has been successful in proving that the deceased marriedwoman met with unnatural death within two years of her marriage. She was subjected toharassment and cruelty to meet unlawful demand of dowry at the hands of the accused soon beforeher death. The death of deceased Sunita falling in the category of unnatural death occurred in hermatrimonial house when she was cohabiting with her husband and in-laws. No plausibleexplanation is offered by the accused to explain under what circumstances, Sunita met with that. Itis a case of dowry death as defined under section 304B of I.P.C. Such crimes are generallycommitted in complete secrecy inside house. Nature and amount of evidence required to establishcharge cannot be of same degree as required in other cases of circumstantial evidence. Silence ofinmates of house about cause of death would become an additional link in chain of circumstances.57. In case of Trimukh Maroti Kirkan Vs. State of Maharashtra (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin para No. 11 has observed as under :-11. The demand for dowry or money from the parents of the bride has shown aphenomenal increase in last few years. Cases are frequently coming before theCourts, where the husband or in-laws have gone to the extent of killing the bride ifthe demand is not met. These crimes are generally committed in complete secrecyinside the house and it becomes very difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence. Nomember of the family, even if he is a witness of the crime, would come forward todepose against another family member. The neighbours, whose evidence may be ofsome 33 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors assistance, are generally reluctant todepose in Court as they want to keep aloof and do not want to antagonize aneighbourhood family. The parents or other family members of the bride being awayfrom the scene of commission of crime are not in a position to give direct evidencewhich may inculpate the real accused except regarding the demand of money ordowry and harassment caused to the bride. But, it does not mean that a crimecommitted in secrecy or inside the house should go unpunished.12. If an offence takes place inside the privacy of a house and in such circumstanceswhere the assailants have all the opportunity to plan and commit the offence at thetime and in circumstances of their choice, it will be extremely difficult for theprosecution to lead evidence to establish the guilt of the accused if the strict principleof circumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is insisted upon by the Courts. A Judgedoes not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished.A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties.(See Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecution 1944 AC 315 quoted with approval byArijit Pasayat, J. in State of Punjab Vs. Karnail Singh (2003) 11 SCC 271). The lawdoes not enjoin a duty on the prosecution to lead evidence of such character which isalmost impossible to be led or at any rate extremely difficult to be led. The duty onthe prosecution is to lead such evidence which it is capable of leading, having regardto the facts and circumstances of the case. Here it is necessary to keep in mindSection 106 of the Evidence Act which says that when any fact is especially within theknowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. Illustration (b)Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/18appended to this section throws some light on the content and scope of this provisionand it reads: 2003 AIR SCW 4065 34 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors(b) A is charged with traveling on a railway without ticket. The burden of proving thathe had a ticket is on him."Where an offence like murder is committed in secrecy inside a house, the initialburden to establish the case would undoubtedly be upon the prosecution, but thenature and amount of evidence to be led by it to establish the charge cannot be of thesame degree as is required in other cases of circumstantial evidence. The burdenwould be of a comparatively lighter character. In view of Section 106 of the EvidenceAct there will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to give a cogentexplanation as to how the crime was committed. The inmates of the house cannot getaway by simply keeping quiet and offering no explanation on the supposed premisethat the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon the prosecution and there is noduty at all on an accused to offer any explanation.58. Having regard to the recent citation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Preet Pal Singh Vs.State of U.P. and Anr. (supra), wherein it is held that where the ingredients of section 304B of I.P.C.are satisfied, the deeming fiction of section of 304B would be attracted and the husband or therelatives shall be deemed to have caused the death of the bride/married woman.59. In the foregoing paras, it is held by us that Sunita met with unnatural death within two years ofher marriage. It was a custodial death. Soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty at thehands of her 35 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors husband and in-laws in connection with thedemand for dowry. The presumption as provided under section 113-B of the Evidence Act comesinto picture.60. Having regard to the entirety of material and careful scrutiny of the witnesses examined by theprosecution machinery and defence as well, we arrived at conclusion that the prosecution machineryhas been successful in proving the guilty of all accused punishable under section 304B and 498Aread with section 34 of I.P.C. It is a case of custodial death. She was four weeks pregnant anddreaming happy life after having baby, but unfortunately, met with unnatural death in matrimonialhouse. The accused are responsible for such custodial death in view of section 304B of I.P.C. coupledwith provisions of section 113B of the Evidence Act, 1872.61. On perusing the impugned judgment and order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge,Ahmednagar whereby accused No. 1/Achyut alone came to be convicted under section 304B of I.P.C.The finding recorded by the Additional Sessions Judge to that effect appears to be erroneous onfacts in view of the above referred evidence of prosecution witnesses discussed in detail. The learnedtrial Judge has acquitted accused Nos. 2 to 4 on same set of facts and evidence without assigningsufficient reasons for carving out them from charge under section 304B of I.P.C. On perusal of paraNo. 34 of the impugned judgment, learned trial Judge after appreciating the evidence of prosecutionwitnesses and 36 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors defence held that case against the accusedAchyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/19No.1/Achyut under section 304B of I.P.C. is proved and he alone needs to be convicted. There are noreasons why remaining accused Nos. 2 to 4 are not liable to be convicted on the same set of facts andevidence. It is an error committed by the learned trial Judge while recording the finding against thecharge under section 304B of I.P.C. The appeal preferred by the State against the original accusedNos. 2 to 4 for their acquittal out of charge under section 304B of I.P.C. is found worthy and needsto be allowed. Late sunita was cohabiting in the matrimonial house along with the husband andin-laws/ accused Nos. 2 to 4 when she met with unnatural death within two years of her marriage.She was subjected to harassment at their hands to fulfill unlawful demand of dowry. Accused Nos. 2to 4 are equally liable to hold guilty for the offence punishable under section 304B read with section34 of I.P.C. They must be dealt with the same way as like accused No.1/Achyut. We find merit in theappeal preferred by the State against the acquittal of original accused Nos. 2 to 4/in-laws wherebythey were set at free from the charge under section 304B of I.P.C.62. Now, coming to the another appeal preferred by State regarding enhancement of sentenceawarded against accused Nos. 1 to 4 under section 498A read with section 34 of I.P.C. All theaccused have been convicted for the offence punishable under section 498A read with section 34 ofI.P.C. and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months and pay fine of Rs. 2,000/-(Rupees Two Thousand) each with default clause.37 CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors63. Having regard to the nature of offence and in view of the earlier part of discussion andconsidering the facts of the case entirety, we are of the considered view to upheld the same. No needto enhance the sentence awarded against all the accused under section 498A read with section 34 ofI.P.C. There is no merit in the appeal for enhancement of sentence.64. Mr Chatterji, learned counsel for the appellant by way of alternative submission has urged toreduce the sentence up to 10 years by placing reliance on the recent judgment of the Division Benchof this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 135/2014 with connected appeal dated 07.07.2021. TheDivision Bench of this Court by taking into considerion peculiar facts of the case was pleased toreduce the sentence awarded against the accused No.1 and restricted to undergo rigorousimprisonment for 10 years with fine of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand) with default clause. Wedo not find such circumstances to reduce the sentence awarded against the appellant/accused No.1under section 304B of I.P.C. to undergo imprisonment for life. However, if sentence of accused Nos.2 to 4 is restricted for 10 years rigorous imprisonment, it would meet the ends of justice, in view offacts of the case in hand.65. Having regard to the above reasons and discussion, we arrived at conclusion to dismiss theappeal preferred by accused No. 1- Achyut Bhaskar Kale vide Criminal Appeal No. 271/20214.Whereas, we are convinced to allow the Criminal Appeal No. 683/2014 preferred by the 38CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors State against the acquittal of original accused Nos. 2 to 4 fromcharge of dowry death punishable under section 304B of I.P.C. We are equally convinced to dismissthe appeal preferred by the State for enhancement of sentence awarded against all the accusedpunishable under section 498A of I.P.C.Achyut Bhaskar Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 15 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73717658/20ORDER (A) The Criminal Appeal No. 271/2014 preferred by the Appellant/ Achyut s/o Bhaskar Kaleis dismissed.(B) The Criminal Appeal No. 325/2014 preferred by the Appellant/ State of Maharashtra is alsodismissed.(C) The Criminal Appeal No. 683/2014 preferred by the Appellant/ State of Maharashtra againstoriginal accused Nos. 2 to 4 is allowed.(D) Resultantly, the impugned Judgment and order of conviction passed in Sessions Case No.163/2012 by the Additional Sessions Judge, Ahmednagar is modified as under :-(i) Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are convicted for the offence punishable under section 304B read withsection 34 of I.P.C.(ii) The sentence awarded against the Appellant/Achyut s/o Bhaskar Kale to undergo imprisonmentfor life is confirmed.(iii) Accused Nos. 2 to 4 shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years and pay fine of Rs.1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand) each, and in default, rigorous imprisonment for one month for theoffence punishable under section 304B read with section 34 of I.P.C.                                39           CRI.APPEAL NOs.271-14 & 2 Ors(iv)          The sentence awarded by the Additional Sessions Judge,Ahmednagar against all the accused for the offence punishable under section 498-A read withsection 34 of I.P.C. is hereby confirmed.(v) Accused Nos. 2 to 4 are on bail and they shall surrender before the trial court to undergo thesentence in above terms.(vi) The learned trial Judge is directed to issue conviction warrant accordingly.(E)           The Appeals are disposed of accordingly.
