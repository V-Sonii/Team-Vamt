It follows that, greater the power attached to any post, stricter the criteria must be forappointment to such post.

The facts giving rise to both these petitions, are as follows :The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, New Delhi in exercise of the powerconferred under Sections 29 and 43 read with clauses (n) and (w) of sub-section 2 of Section 101 ofthe Act of 2019, framed Rules, vide notification dated 15 th July, 2020, called as ConsumerProtection (Qualification for appointment, method of recruitment, procedure of appointment, termof office, resignation and removal of President and Members of the pil-11-21(J-1).odt 4/57 StateCommission and District Commission) Rules 2020 (In short "the Rules of 2020").4.

Rule 6 of the Rules of2020, is in respect of procedure of appointment. Sub-rule 9 of Rule 6 permits the SelectionCommittee to determine its procedure for making its recommendations keeping in view therequirement of the State Commission or the District Commission and after taking into account thesuitability, record of past performance, integrity and adjudicatory experience.5. In pursuance to Rule 6, the State of Maharashtra constituted a Selection Committee videGovernment Resolution dated 6th November, 2020.

In both these matters, on 30th June, 2021 the selection process initiated for appointment ofMembers of State Commission, was made subject to the final results of these petitions, by thisCourt.9. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties.10. Dr. Uday Warunjikar, learned counsel for the petitioner in Public Interest Litigation No. 11 of2021, argues that under the Rules of 2020, the power conferred upon the Selection Committee todetermine its own procedure for selection of President and Members of the District and StateCommission constituted under the Act of 2019, is in pil-11-21(J-1).odt 8/57 contravention of thedirections issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh andothers Vrs. All Uttar Pradesh Consumer Protection Bar Association. 1 (hereinafter referred as'UPCPBA'). Thus, he submits that the Rule 6(9) of the Rule 2020 is ultra virus.11. It is submitted that looking at the judicial functions to be performed by President and Membersof the District and State Commissions constituted under the Act of 2019, the selection withoutholding written examination, but, only on the basis of viva-voce, would result into selection ofunsuitable candidates which will further result in denial of justice.12. Dr. Uday Warunjikar, learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that no justification hasbeen offered by the respondents for not following uniform process across country, for appointments,as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of UPCPBA.13. The learned counsel for the petitioner, fairly concedes that in absence of any challenge raised tothe appointment of the President of the State Consumer Dispute 1 2017 (1) SCC 444pil-11-21(J-1).odt 9/57 Redressal Commission, State of Maharashtra, which was made during thependency of the petition, he does not want to raise any grievance about the same.14. Shri Mandlekar, learned counsel for the petitioner appearing in Writ Petition No. 1096 of 2021,reiterated the contentions raised by Shri Warunjikar. However, in addition, he has submitted that,prescribing minimum experience of 20 and 15 years for President and Members of State and DistrictCommission respectively, in the fields stipulated in the advertisement as one of the eligibilitycriteria, is contrary to the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofMadras Bar Association Vrs. Union of India2 (herein after referred as "MBA-2020") and in the caseof UPCPBA. It is submitted that the said condition would deprive many lawyers who are otherwisequalified and have legal expertise and experience of 10 years or more.15. Shri Mandlekar, learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his contentions also relies uponthe following judgments.Vijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/5i.

Per contra, Shri Aurangabadkar, learned ASGI submits that it may not be possible to conduct thewritten test as demanded by the petitioners, which may further delay the process of selection. Hesubmits that the State Government is expected to exercise complete transparency in the selectionprocedure. It is submitted that the procedure which has been adopted by the Selection Committee isas per the powers conferred upon the Selection Committee under the Rules of 2020, and thereforethere is no illegality committed by the Selection Committee in this matter.17. Shri Amit Madiwale, appearing for the State, submits that the Respondent-State is following theprocedure to fill up the vacancies in the State and District Consumer Commissions, as stipulatedunder the Rules of 2020. Our attention has been drawn to paragraph 6 of the affidavit in reply filedby the State, dated 29th July, 2021, inter alia stating therein that in response to the advertisementdated 2 nd 4 2021 SCC Online SC 463 5 (2005) 12 SCC 77 pil-11-21(J-1).odt 11/57 February, 2021,total 1138 applications were received for 25 vacant posts of President, District Consumer DisputesRedressal Commission and Member, District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. It isfurther pointed out that considering the huge number of applications it was not possible to takeinterviews of all the candidates who are eligible for these posts. Therefore, the Selection Committeedecided to take written exam of the candidates through an agency which is on Government Panel.18. It is further pointed out that considering the vacant posts, the Selection Committee has decidedto take interviews of 125 candidates i.e. in 1:5 ratio, on merit as per the decision dated 9th July,2021. By arguing so, he prays for dismissal of petition.19. To consider the rival contentions of the parties, we have perused the record and gone throughvarious relevant judgments.20. Before touching on the challenge raised in these petitions, we are of the opinion that a briefreference to the historical background of Tribunalisation in India, is necessary for betterunderstanding of the controversy.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 12/5721. In a democratic country like India, judicial functions and judicial powers constitute the essentialattributes of a sovereign State and are entrusted to regularly established Courts by the Constitutionof India through a pattern of common law system. There are constitutional rights, statutory rights,human rights and natural rights, protection and implementation of which depends on properadministration of justice.22. There is a three tier judicial system, in India. The subordinate Courts, the High Courts and theSupreme Court. The subordinate Courts are vested with the original jurisdiction in all mattersVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/6except those, which are barred either expressly or impliedly. The High Courts have appellate andrevisional jurisdiction along with the jurisdiction to issue prerogative writs. Some of the High Courtshave original jurisdiction as well. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has original jurisdiction and advisoryjurisdiction where the President of India may seek opinion. It can issue prerogative writs and hasappellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has also discretion to entertain Special Leave Petition.23. The delay and backlog in administration of justice had raised a concern. The Law Commission ofIndia therefore, pil-11-21(J-1).odt 13/57 in its Fourteenth Report (1958) made recommendations forreforming the administration of justice delivery system which have been implemented from time totime to revamp the judicial system with a view to reduce delay and enlarge access to justice.24. The Tribunal, as a result, emerged as an effective mechanism to reduce the backlog and delay inadministration of justice.25. The term 'Tribunal' is derived from the word 'Tribunes', which means 'Magistrate of the ClassicalRoman Republic'.26. In India, history of Tribunals dates back to the year 1941, when first Tribunal was established inthe form of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.27. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has in various judgments explicitly held that tribunals havebeen established with the object of discharging quasi-judicial duties by acting judicially whichdifferentiates them from other administrative bodies. A tribunal is neither a Court nor an executivebody, but they have an obligation to act judicially. Tribunals are endowed with the judicial functionsas pil-11-21(J-1).odt 14/57 distinguished from purely administrative or executive functions. As aquasi-judicial body, the Tribunal performs the judicial functions for deciding the matters in ajudicious manner. It is not bound by law to observe all the technicalities, complexities, refinement,discrimination and restrictions that are applicable to the Courts of record in conducting trials, but atthe same time, a tribunal is required to look at all matters from the standpoint of substance as wellas form and be certain that the hearing is conducted and the matter is disposed of with fairness,honesty, and impartiality.28. The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act of 1976 brought about a massive change in theadjudication of disputes in the Country. It has provided for the insertion of Articles 323-A and323-B in the Constitution of India, whereby the goal of establishment of Administrative Tribunals byParliament as well as State Legislature, to adjudicate the matters specified is made possible.29. The statement of objects and reasons for insertion of Articles 323A and 323B show that it wereto reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the speedy disposal of service matters,revenue matters and certain matters of special importance in the context of the sociopil-11-21(J-1).odt 15/57 economic development and progress, it is considered expedient to provideadministrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while presenting the jurisdiction tothe Supreme Court in regard to such matters under Article 136 of the Constitution of India and tomake certain modifications in writ jurisdiction of the High Court's under Article 226 of theVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/7Constitution of India.30. Hence, looking to the desperate need to overcome hurdles of delay in administration of justice,creation of tribunals has evolved itself as one solution.31. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Rojer Mathew Vrs. South Indian Bank Ltd.,6has observed that the delay and backlog in the administration of justice is of paramount concern forany country governed by the rule of law. In our present judicial set up, disputes often take manydecades to attain finality, travelling across a series of lower Courts to High Court and ending with aninevitable approach to the Supreme Court. Such Crawling pace of justice delivery system onlyaggravates the misery of affected parties. It is further observed that it would, however, be wrong toplace the blame of such delay squarely on the judiciary, an expirical 6 2020(6) SCC 1pil-11-21(J-1).odt 16/57 examination of pending cases clearly demonstrates that the ratio of judgesagainst the Country's population is one of the lowest in the world and the manpower (support staff)and infrastructure provided is dismal. In addition to the delay in administration of justice, anotherimportant facet requiring attention is the rise of specialization and increase of complex andcommercial aspects, which require esoteric appraisal and adjudication. The existing lower Courts inthe Country are not well equipped to deal with such complex new issues which see constantevolution as compared to the stable nature of existing civil, criminal and tax jurisdiction.32. Thus, due to expansion of Government activities in the social and other similar fields along withcommercial ventures in different sectors, a need had arisen for availing the services of personshaving knowledge in specialized fields for effective and speedier dispensation of justice, whereas, thetraditional mode of administration of justice by the Courts of law was felt to be unequipped withsuch expertise to deal with the complex issues arising in the changing scenario. Hence, Tribunal notonly emerged as an effective mechanism to ameliorate the burden of judiciary but also with theexpertise and knowledge in specialized area.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 17/5733. However, when the jurisdiction relating to some special matters was shifted from Courts toTribunals, issues relating to lack of uniformity in the matter of qualification, appointment andservice conditions had emerged and surfaced.34. In the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd vs Essar Power Limited7, the Hon'ble SupremeCourt of India framed certain questions and requested the Law Commission to give its report on it.Accordingly, the Law Commission on 27th October, 2017 submitted its 272 nd report titled as"Assessment of Statutory Frame Work of Tribunals in India", for consideration of CentralGovernment.

In the event of exclusion of juris- (Sections 14 and 15) diction of all courts, it isessential to pro-vide for an equally effective alternative mechanism even at grass root level. Thiscould be ensured by providing State- level sittings looking to the quantum of work ofa particular Tribunal. Once that is done, the access to justice will stand ensured.V.

Now, keeping in mind the above referred historical backdrop of Tribunalisation, we will moveahead to consider the controversy involved in this matter.36.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the aforesaid matter constituted a Committeepresided over by Mr. Justice Arijit Pasayat, a former Judge of the Apex Court, to examine followingissues:-(i) the infrastructural requirements of the State Commissions, deficiencies ininfrastructure and remedial measures;(ii) the position of vacancies of members at the national, state and district level;(iii) the need for additional Benches at the national, State and district level;(iv) conditions of eligibility for appointment of non- judicial members;(v) administrative powers which have been or should be conferred on the PresidingOfficers of the State and District Fora;(vi) service conditions including pay scales governing the Presiding Officers andmembers;(vii) requirements of staff;Vijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/12(viii) creation of a separate cadre of staff at the national, State and district level; andother relevant issues.         pil-11-21(J-1).odt                                           23/57                 (ix)        other relevant issues.38. Thereupon, the Committee inquired extensively into the matters referred to itand made assessment of the prevailing conditions in the Fora constituted under theAct of 1986, in various States including the State of Maharashtra.The committee consequently, submitted its interim report on 17th October, 2016, whereupon, theApex Court directed the Union of India and State Governments, as under:-(i) The Union Government shall for the purpose of ensuring uniformity in theexercise of the rule making power under Section 10(3) and Section 16(2) of theConsumer Protection Act, 1986 frame model rules for adoption by the stategovernments.

These rules shall be finalized upon due consultation with the President of the NationalConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission, within the period stipulated above;(iv) Upon the approval of the model rules by this Court, the state governments shall proceed toadopt the model rules by framing appropriate rules in the exercise of the rule making powers underSection 30 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986;               (v)     The National Consumer Disputes Redressal                       Commission       is     requested      to     formulate                       regulations    under     Section     30A      with     theVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/13previous approval of the Central Government within a period of three months from today in order toeffectuate the power of administrative control vested in the National Commission over the StateCommissions under Section 24(B)(1)(iii) and in respect of the administrative control pil-11-21(J-1).odt 25/57 of the State Commissionsover the District fora in terms of Section 24(B)(2) as explained in this Judgment to effectivelyimplement the objects and purposes of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.39. Consequently, the Union Government framed the model rules, whereupon the StateGovernments were directed to frame rules in accordance with the Final Draft Rules submitted by theUnion of India.40. The State of Maharashtra, appropriately, framed the rules by issuing notification dated 24thMay, 2019, in confirmation with the final draft rules, prepared by the Union of India.41. However, in view of new challenges due to drastic transformation of consumer markets for goodsand services, the Act of 1986 was repealed and re-enacted vide Act of 2019. Consequently, the Unionof India in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 29 and 43 r/w Clauses (n) and (w) ofsub-section 101 of the Act of 2019, framed the Rules of 2020, vide Notification dated 15.07. 2020.42.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of L. Chandra Kumar Vrs. Union of India andothers 8 has observed that the numerous Tribunals with lack of uniformity in the matter ofqualification, appointments, tenure and service conditions is causing the major concern in effectiveworking of the present Tribunal system.45. In the 272nd report of the Law Commission, a need of uniformity in the appointment, tenureand service conditions for the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Members appointed in Tribunals, hasbeen expressed.46. The Hon'ble Apex Court, in the case of UPCPBA, has observed that, the difficulty arises becauseof the vesting of the rule-making power in the State Government, resulting in a lack of uniformity ofrules across the country, both in regard to the terms and conditions of service as well as in regard tothe modalities to be followed in ensuring that persons appointed as members fulfill thequalifications which are prescribed. It is further noted that in the absence of a uniform pattern andtransparency in selection, the result is of wide variation in standards with great deal of subjectivity,and bureaucratic and political interference creeping in. The 8 1997(3) SCC 261 pil-11-21(J-1).odt28/57 Hon'ble Apex Court therefore, directed the State Governments to frame appropriate rules inexercise of Rule-making power in accordance with the Final Draft Model Rules prepared by theUnion of India and adopt the same. Consequently, the State of Maharashtra, framed the rules videnotification dated 24th May, 2019, prescribing therein a written examination and Viva-voce forselection of President and Members of the District Forum and State Forum.47. It is notable that, even prior to issuance of aforesaid directions by the Apex Court, a written testwas prescribed for selection of President or Members of the District Forum or State Commission,Maharashtra. However, in the case in hand, the said procedure has not been followed and viva-voceas the only criteria for selection, was prescribed.48. In the case of MBA-2021 the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India while dealing with the contentionsof learned Attorney General of India that ordinance cannot be challenged on the ground that it iscontrary to judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India, it is held thus :44. "The permissibility of legislative override in this country should be in accordance with theprinciples laid pil-11-21(J-1).odt 29/57 down by this Court in the aforementioned as well as otherjudgments, which have been culled out as under:Vijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/15a) The effect of the judgments of the Court can be nullified by a legislative act removing the basis ofthe judgment. Such law can be restrospective. Retrospective amendment should be reasonable andnor arbitrary and must not be violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under theConstitution.b) The test for determining the validity of a validating legislation is that the judgment pointing outthe defect would not have been passed, if the altered position as sought to be brought in by thevalidating statute existed before the Court at the time of rendering its judgment. In other words, thedefect pointed out should have been cured such that the basis of the judgement pointing out thedefect is removed.c) Nullification of mandamus by an enactment would be impermissible legislative exercise [See :S.R.Bhagwant (supra)]. Even interim directions cannot be reversed by a legislative veto [See:Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (supra) and Medical Council of India v. State of Kerala & Ors.]d) Transgression of constitutional limitations and intrusion into the judicial power by the legislatureis violative of the principle of separation of powers, the rule of law and of Article 14 of theConstitution of India."49. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of MBA-2021 while dealing with the issue ofimportance of independence of judiciary, in its majority veiw has observed thus :32. The constitutional mandate is that the legislature should adhere to the principleslaid down in Part-IV of the Constitution of India while enacting legislations. Noprovision shall be made in legislative acts which would have the tendency of makinginroads into the judicial sphere. Any such encroachment by the legislature wouldamount to pil-11-21(J-1).odt 30/57 violating the principles of separation of powers,judicial independence and the rule of law. Independence of courts from the executiveand the legislature is fundamental to the rule of law and one of the basic tenets of theIndian Constitution. Separation of powers between the three organs i.e., thelegislature, the executive and the judiciary, is a consequence of the principles ofequality as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution. Any incursion into the judicialdomain by the other two wings of the Government would, thus, be unconstitutional."50. In the above referred back drop, it is imperative to examine, whether any change has taken placein legislative scheme or in nature of performance of duties and function of adjudicatory authoritiesafter enactment of the Act of 2019 for such deviation and for not following the direction issued bythe Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India in the case of UPCPBA, relating to bringing uniformity ofrules across the country in regard to the modalities to be followed in appointment and selections ofPresident and Members of the District Forum and State Forum.51. For this purpose, we will compare the relevant functions and powers conferred upon theFora/Commission under the Act of 1986 and the Act of 2019, respectively.

Having compared the relevant function and powers conferred upon the fora / commission, it isexplicitly clear that under the Act of 2019 the District commission and State Commission arecontinued to be vested and conferred with powers of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure,1908, as it was vested under the Act 1986.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 38/5753. It is noteworthy that, under Section 71 of the Act of 2019, every order made by Commission shallbe enforced by it in the same manner as if it were a decree made by a Court in a suit before it.54. Furthermore, while re-enacting the Act of 1986, vide the Act of 2019, the word "Consumer" hasbeen re- defined and the concept of "Product Liability" has been newly introduced and defined.Similarly, "e-commerce and electronic service provider" has been defined by inserting the same. TheAct of 2019 has also introduced a vital concept of "electronic service provider" and further providedstrict penalties for false and misleading advertisement. The Act of 2019 further introduces a newchapter on "Mediation" as an Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanism in order to resolve theconsumer disputes faster without having to approach the Commission.55. Admittedly, in this case, neither the Union of India nor the State Government in their respectivereplies, have come up with a case or have pointed out that, after the enactment of Act of 2019 andRules of 2020, the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofpil-11-21(J-1).odt 39/57 UPCPBA, have become non-operative or in-effective, relating to the need forhaving uniformity of rules across the country in regard to the modalities to be followed, ensuringthat persons appointed fulfill the qualification prescribed, owing to any valid and justifiable reason.56. Thus, it is amply clear that there is no change in legislative scheme or performance of judicialfunction of the State Commission or District Commission, constituted under the Act of 2019, as theywere performing under the Act of 1986. Resultantly, we have no hesitation to hold that thedirections issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of UPCPBA, for havingVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/23uniformity across the country in standards, selection and appointment of President and Memberson Fora, are equally binding with full force, even after the enactment of the Act of 2019.57. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in the case of UPCPBA, has given sufficient reasons to haveuniformity across the country as regards standards and modalities in appointments of Presidentsand Members of Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, under the Act of 1986. The Union of Indiawhile framing Rules of 2020 under the Act of 2019, ought to have framed the rules in consonancewith the pil-11-21(J-1).odt 40/57 directions of the Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India, issued in thecase of UPCPBA, to cure defects pointed out in the said judgment, which has admittedly not beendone. Whereas, under the Rules of 2020, the uncontrolled and uncanalised discretion has beengranted to the Selection Committee, which will produce undesirable results and which will be inviolation of fundamental rights to equality before law and equal protection of laws guaranteed byArticle 14 of the Constitution of India, that includes a right to have the person's rights adjudicated bya forum which exercises judicial power in an impartial and independent manner, as held inMBA-2021.58. In the case of State of Rajasthan and others Vs. Basant Nahata (supra) it has been held by theHon'ble Supreme Court of India, that the necessity of the legislatures delegating its powers in favourof the executive is a part of legislative function. Such delegation of power, however, cannot be wide,uncanalised or unguided. The legislature while delegating, such power is required to lay down thecriteria or standard so as to enable the delegatee to act within the framework of the statute.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 41/5759. However, the Union Government has granted complete discretion under the Rules of 2020 tothe Selection Committee to determine its own procedure. The ultimate result of the same would benothing but creating a situation which has been narrated in the case of UPCPBA, whichundoubtedly, will again lead to wide variation in standards as well as a great deal of subjective,bureaucratic and political interference, and finally it will result in denial of justice which will be inviolation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.60. As noted herein above that the Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India in the case of UPCPBA, hasheld the adjudicatory powers of the Fora under the Act of 1986, as 'judicial functions', it would beappropriate at this juncture to consider the importance of judicial function/ judicial office inpeople's life to further understand the proportionate responsibility attached to it and importance ofhaving a criteria akin to the responsibility, for appointment.61. In the case of MBA-2010, the Hon'ble Apex Court, has observed that the rule of law can bemeaningful only if there is an independent and impartial judiciary to render justice. An independentjudiciary can exist only when persons with competence, ability and independence with impeccablepil-11-21(J-1).odt 42/57 character man the judicial institutions. When the legislature proposes tosubstitute a tribunal in place of the High Court to exercise the jurisdiction which the High Court isexercising, it goes without saying that the standards expected from the judicial members of theTribunal and standards applied for appointing such members, should be as nearly as possible asVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/24applicable to High Court Judges, which, apart from a basic degree in Law, are reflective of richexperience in the practice of law, independent outlook, integrity, character and good reputation.62. As Justice Stephen Breyer (Supreme Court of the United States), writes:-"...When you are a judge...it's important to be able to imagine what other people'slives might be like, lives that your decisions will affect. People who are not onlydifferent from you, but also very different from each other... And this empathy, thisability to envision the practical consequences on one's contemporaries of a law or alegal decision, seems to me to be a crucial quality in a judge."63. Justice Hidayatulla, former Chief Justice of India has placed observance by judges of punctualityof time, on a very high pedestal. According to him, a Judge who does not observe punctuality of timedoes not believe in rule of law. Whereas, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of UPCPBA hasobserved that in the Fora under the Act of 1986, non-judicial members do not maintain punctuality.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 43/5764. It is enounced by Chief Justice Burger (United States) that a sense of confidence in the Court isessential to maintain a fabric of order and liberty for free people. Three things would destroy thatconfidence and do incalculable damage to the society; that people come to believe that inefficiencyand delay will drain even a just judgment of its value; that people who had long been exploited in thesmall transactions of day life come to believe that Courts cannot vindicate their legal rights againstfraud and overreaching; that people come to be believe that the law-in larger sense cannot fulfill itsprimary function to protect them and their families in their homes, at their work and on the publicstreets.65. The historical background of Tribunalisation depicts that Tribunals have been established toovercome hurdles of delay in administration of justice and with objects of discharging quasi-judicialduties by acting judicially. The Tribunals are endowed with the judicial functions with a duty todecide the matters in judicious manner.66. Thus, it is clear that the judiciary is meant to uphold the constitutional values and protect thecitizens from pil-11-21(J-1).odt 44/57 encroachment of their constitutional rights. Judiciary is abody of legal and constitutional experts and they are called upon to decide contentions, issuesbetween the parties, strictly in accordance with law and the Constitution. Thus, the judges have agreat responsibility and obligation towards the people. They exercise the authority of the State inpublic, in issues of immense importance for the parties and often to the community at large. Thegreatest strength of the judiciary is the faith of the people in it and the very existence ofadministration of justice system depends on the judges.67. The discussion made herein above, further makes it clear that "Judicial Office" is essentially apublic trust and therefore, it is expected that a judge must be a man of high integrity, honesty andshall possess several qualities including legal expertise, ability to handle cases, proper personalVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/25conduct and ethical behaviour and shall ensure impartiality, fairness and reasonableness inconsideration. Whereas the technical member ensures the availability of expertise and experiencerelated to the field of adjudication for which the Special Tribunal is created.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 45/5768. Having considered the importance of judicial function in people's lives and qualities which areneeded to be possessed by a judge, we will now proceed to consider and examine the adverse effectsof not having appropriate criteria for selection and uniformity in selection.69. In this regard, the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in the case ofUPCPBA, are relevant, which depict a sorry state of affairs in the Fora, as under:a) The fora do not function as effective as expected.b) The quality of presiding members, especially of non-judicial members at the state and district levels is poor.c) Most of the non-judicial members are not even capable of writing or dictating small orders.d) At certain places non-judicial members act in unison against the presiding officer, while passingorders contrary to law, damaging the reputation of the adjudicating body. Presidents, as a result,prefer a situation where such non- judicial members absent themselves from work if only so thatjudicial work can be carried out by the presiding judge impartially and objectively.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 46/57e) Many non-judicial members do not maintain punctuality and others attend to work sporadicallyonce or twice a week.f) Many of the non-judicial members attend the place of work only to sign orders which have beendrafted by the presiding officer.70. The Hon'ble Apex Court further quoted three instances showing bureaucratic and politicalinfluence in selection process as a result of which the functioning of consumer fora is detrimentallyaffected. The instances are as under.i) one non-Judicial Member Mr. Jamal Akhtar posted at District Forum, Meerut has been absentingwithout permission since 11th May, 2015, which resulted in his post being declared vacant andanother non-Judicial member posted elsewhere came to be attached in his place.ii) One non-Judicial Member who had her first term at Lucknow and who was enjoying her secondterm, having been appointed for District Forum, Barabanki but attached to Greater Noida, as per theVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/26reports, came Forum once or twice a week. Another woman non-Judicial Member who happenedpil-11-21(J-1).odt 47/57 to be wife of a bureaucrat though appointed for District Forum, Baghpat wasattached/posted at Greater Noida.iii) In Haryana, a non-judicial Woman Member did/ would not attend the District Forum regularly,as she had to travel around 150/160 km every day.71. The Hon'ble Apex Court has therefore, held that both in relation to the State Commissions andthe District Fora, a member must be a person of ability and standing with adequate knowledge andexperience of at least ten years in dealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce,accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration, as broad general categories. The Apex Courthas thus, found the need to conduct written test to assess the knowledge of persons, justifiable.72. In this matter it seems that the above referred observations of the Apex Court were not broughtto the notice of the Selection Committee when it determined its own procedure for selection.73. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in the case of MBA-2010 has held that the fundamentalright to equality before law and equal protection of laws guaranteed by Article pil-11-21(J-1).odt48/57 14 of the Constitution, clearly includes a right to have the person's rights, adjudicated by aforum which exercises judicial power in an impartial and independent manner, consistent with therecognized principles of adjudication. The Apex Court in the said case further referred to the case ofS.P. Sampath Kumar etc Vrs. Union of India and others 9, wherein it has held that where theprescription of qualification was found by the court, to be not proper and conducive for the properfunctioning of the tribunal, it will result in invalidation of the relevant provisions relating to theconstitution of the tribunal. If the qualifications/eligibility criteria for appointment fail to ensurethat the members of the Tribunal are able to discharge judicial functions, the said provisions cannotpass the scrutiny of the higher the judiciary.74. It is further held in the MBA-2010 that the legislature is presumed not to legislate contrary torule of law and therefore know that where disputes are to be adjudicated by a judicial body otherthan Courts, its standards should approximately be the same as to what is expected of mainstreamjudiciary.        9(1987) 1 SCC 124         pil-11-21(J-1).odt                                            49/57Vijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/2775. In the case of MBA-2021, his Lordship Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, while recording concurrence tothe judgment authored by his Lordship L. Nageshwar Rao, has observed thus:19. "..... However, in matters that concerned administration of justices, especiallywhere alternative adjudicatory forums are created, the court's concern is greater. Thisis because the Constitution does not and cannot be read so as to provide two kinds ofjustice: one through courts, and one through other bodies. The quality and efficacy ofthese justice delivery mechanisms have to be the same, i.e., the same as that providedby courts, as increasingly, tribunals adjudicate disputes not only between stateagencies and citizens, but also between citizens and citizens as well as citizens andpowerful corporate entities. Therefore, it is the "equal protection" of laws, guaranteedto all persons, through institutions that assure the same competence of its personal,the same fair procedure, and the same independence of adjudicators as is available inexisting courts, that stands directly implicated....."76. As discussed herein above, it is clear that the standard expected from the judicial members of theTribunal and standards applied for appointing such members, should be as nearly as possibleapplicable to the appointment of Judges, exercising such powers. It is also clear that if thequalification or eligibility criteria for appointment fail to ensure that the Members of the Tribunalare able to discharge judicial functions, the said provisions cannot pass the scrutiny of the higherjudiciary.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 50/5777. In the case in hand admittedly no written test was prescribed in the impugned notice forselection of Members of District and State Commissions but, only a viva- voce test. However, duringthe pendency of the present petition and in the middle of selection process, a decision was taken bythe Selection Committee to hold written test for selection, which is contrary to the well settledprinciple of law that in the middle of the selection process, rules for selection cannot be changed.78. Moreover, the decision of the Selection Committee to hold the written test, supports the case ofthe petitioner that looking at the judicial functions needed to be performed by the President andMembers of District and State Commissions, the criteria for selection and appointment shall beapplied as nearly as possible applicable to the judges in mainstream judiciary, exercising the similarpowers.79. Therefore, for the reasons recorded herein above, we have no hesitation to hold that Sub Rule (9)of Rule 6 of Rules of 2020, framed under the Act of 2019, is ultra vires, and violative of Article 14 ofthe Constitution of India. Consequently, we find substance in the contention of the pil-11-21(J-1).odt51/57 petitioner that the advertisement dated 2 nd February, 2021 published by the respondent no.2for the filling up of vacancies for the post of Members of State Commission and President andMembers of District Commission, Maharashtra State, is arbitrary, unreasonable, ex-facie bad in lawand violative of the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofMBA-2020 and MBA-2021 as well as in the case of UPCPBA.Vijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/2880. Now, we would deal with the challenge made to the validity of Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules 2020.For the sake of convenience, Rule 3 (2)(b) and Rule 4(2)(c) of the Rules, 2020 are reproducedhereunder, which read thus:3. Qualifications for appointment of President and members of the State Commission- (1)....(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a member unless he is of notless than forty years of age and possesses-(a)....(b) a bachelor's degree from a recognised university and is a person of ability,integrity and standing, and has special knowledge and professional experience of notless than twenty years in consumer affairs, law, public affairs, administration,economics, commerce, industry, finance, management, engineering, technology,public health or medicine:(3)....pil-11-21(J-1).odt 52/574.

(3)...."81. The Rules 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) of the Rules 2020 deal with the eligibility criteriaseeking experience of not less than 20 years in consumer affairs, law, public affairs,administration, economics, commerce, industry, finance, management, engineering,technology, public health or medicine, for the post of Members of State Commissionand experience in similar fields of not less than 15 years for the post of President andMembers of District Commission. In the case of MBA-2020, the Hon'ble SupremeCourt has directed that the Rules shall be amended to make an advocate with anexperience of atleast 10 years eligible for appointment as judicial members in theVijaykumar Bhima Dighe vs Union Of India, Through ... on 14 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9254205/29Tribunals.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 53/5782. Similarly, in the case of UPCPBA the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that bothin relation to the State Commissions and the district fora, a member must be a personof ability and standing with adequate knowledge and experience of at least 10 years indealing with problems relating to economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry,public affairs or administration.83. Thus, it is clear that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, has repeatedly held that to have 10years of experience in law and in other specialized fields as prescribed and stipulated under thestatute, is sufficient for appointment as a judicial member in the Tribunal.84. The Rules 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) of the Rules of 2020 to the extend prescribing a minimumexperience of not less than 20 years for appointment of President and Members of StateCommission and experience of not less than 15 years for appointment of Presidents and Members ofDistrict Commission under the Act of 2019, is an attempt to circumvent the directions issued inMBA-2020 and UPCPBA. Hence, they are arbitrarily, illegal and violates principle of equality beforelaw.pil-11-21(J-1).odt 54/5785. In the circumstances, we have no hesitation to hold that the Rules 3(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) of theRules of 2020 prescribing a minimum experience of not less than 20 years for appointment ofPresident and Members of State Commission and experience of not less than 15 years forappointment of Presidents and Members of District Commission, are unconstitutional and violativeof Article 14 of the Constitution of India.86. During the pendency of the present petitions, the President of State Commission, Maharashtrahas been appointed and has joined the office.
