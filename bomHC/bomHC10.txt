The Suit Plot is a part of the Oshiware District Centre ("ODC"), as notified by MMRDA. Thedevelopment of the ODC is governed by the 'Oshiware District Centre Planning Proposal', assanctioned by the State Government vide Government Notification U.D.D. No. TPB-4391/2885/UD11 dated 16 th January 1992. The Planning Proposal envisages guided development of land in ODCby landowners' participation.9.1 In terms of the aforesaid Planning Proposal, in 1994, MMRDA acquired the Suit Plot from theoriginal owner, Late Shri Nanji Arjun Rathod, with a right to the original owner to develop the SuitPlot. The Original Owner assigned the development rights of the Suit Plot in favour of theDeveloper. MMRDA then executed a lease in favour of the Original Owner through the Developerwho has acted as its Constituted Attorney, for development of the Suit Plot by utilizing FSI of 1.5thereon, upon payment of premium by the Developer. Accordingly, in 2008, the Developer uponpayment of premium to MMRDA began construction of the said Building on the Suit Plot byutilizing the permissible FSI of 1.5.9.2 The Developer entered into separate Agreements for Sale with various flat purchasers, includingthe Appellants herein. The Agreement for Sale under SSP 15/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Recital (hh)specifically provided that the Agreement for Sale was subject to the terms of the said Lease Deed.The said Lease Deed was in turn subject to the MMRDA Act. Further, Clause 28 of the Agreementfor Sale provided that the obligations of the Developer shall always be subject to the provisions ofMOFA. 9.3 The said Building was then constructed by the Developer and flats were handed over tothe flat purchasers, including the Appellants herein, after obtaining, in 2014, an OccupationShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/12Certificate for the said Building. The Appellants claim that despite expiry of the period to form asociety as required under Section 10 of MOFA, the Developer failed in its obligation to form a societyof the flat purchasers or convey the Suit Plot in favour of the flat purchasers as required underSection 11 of MOFA. 9.4 On 18th November 2015, a Notification was issued by the State Governmentthrough Urban Development Department, under Section 37(2) of the Maharashtra Regional TownPlanning Act, 1966 ("MRTP Act") thereby increasing the permissible FSI in the ODC from 1.5 to 3for residential construction and 1.5 to 4 for commercial construction. In view thereof, the Developermade an application to MMRDA for consuming the additional 1.5 FSI which had become availableon the Suit Plot.9.5 The Appellants objected to the said application made by the Developer inter alia on the groundthat the Developer had already exhausted the FSI under the terms of its Lease Deed, in constructionof the said Building and that once the time for SSP 16/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc formation ofsociety had expired, the Developer had no right in the additional FSI of the Suit Plot and that thesame belonged to the flat purchasers of the said Building. Further, it was stated that the Developerhad no right to utilize the additional FSI of the Suit Plot, without the informed consent of the flatpurchasers. The said objection of the flat purchasers was founded on Section 7 of MOFA. 9.6MMRDA vide its letter dated 20th February 2018, rejected the aforesaid objection raised by the flatpurchasers stating that the provisions of MOFA were not applicable to MMRDA. MMRDA allowedthe application made by the Developer for consuming the additional 1.5 FSI on the Suit Plot.Accordingly, the Developer got the building plans approved for construction of another building onthe Suit Plot, known as 'Universal Garden - II' ("the Additional Building"), which was on the eastside of the said Building.9.7 This resulted in the Appellants filing the present Suit inter alia seeking enforcement of theprovisions of MOFA against the Developer and also seeking a declaration that all FSI beyond the FSIutilized and available when the building plan for the said Building were sanctioned, vests in all theflat purchasers of the said Building, including the Appellants herein, along with the right to put upfurther construction on the Suit Plot.9.8 The Appellants also filed the Notice of Motion inter alia seeking an injunction restraining theDeveloper from putting up the Additional Building on the SSP 17/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc SuitPlot and for an injunction restraining MMRDA from granting any construction permissions to theDeveloper for construction of the Additional Building, pending the hearing and final disposal of theSuit. As noted above, during the pendency of the Notice of Motion, the Appellants also filed theInterim Application seeking urgent hearing of the Notice of Motion and the reliefs sought therein, asfurther Commencement Certificate had been granted to the Developer by MMRDA for constructionof the said Additional Building.9.9 The Notice of Motion and Interim Application were opposed by the Developer and MMRDAinter alia on the ground that as the Suit Plot was owned by MMRDA, the provisions of MOFA werenot applicable in the present case. The Developer and MMRDA relied upon Section 31 read withSchedule II, Clause II of MMRDA Act which expressly excludes the application of MOFA to MMRDAor any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/139.10 Upon hearing the parties, the Learned Single Judge vide the Impugned Order rejected theNotice of Motion and Interim Application filed by the Appellants and inter alia held that sinceMMRDA was undisputedly the owner of the Suit Plot, Section 7 of MOFA, as sought to be applied bythe Appellants in the present case, cannot be applied as MOFA has been excluded by the MMRDAAct and any such application of the provisions of MOFA in the present case would prejudice therights of MMRDA. Further, the Learned Single Judge also held that the Appellants will be at SSP18/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc liberty to seek enforcements of other terms of the Agreements for Saleand MOFA obligations against the Developer, which do not affect the rights of MMRDA. 9.11 It is inthese circumstances, that the Appellants have approached this Court under Clause 15 of the LettersPatent Act challenging the Impugned Order passed by the Learned Single Judge.10. In deciding this Appeal and considering the specific reliefs sought by the Appellants we havethought it necessary to decide the fundamental issue of whether the MMRDA Act excludes theapplicability of MOFA. A decision on this issue will have a bearing on any narrower issue such aswhether any specific provision or rights claimed under MOFA would be available to flat purchasersagainst a developer.11. Further, considering the aforesaid question of law involved, by an Order dated 18th January2021, we appointed Shri Rohaan Cama, Advocate as Amicus Curiae to assist the Court in decidingthe present Appeal.FACTUAL BACKGROUND12. The facts necessary for deciding the present Appeal are briefly set out hereunder :12.1          On 12th December 1963, MOFA was enacted.12.2          On 2nd June 1973, the Bombay Metropolitan Regional Plan prepared bythe Bombay Metropolitan Regional Board (constituted by the State Government under theMaharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966) was approved by the State SSP 19/159 appl8104 of 2020.doc Government and the said Plan came into force on 16th August 1973. The RegionalPlanning Board was not the authority for implementing the proposals in the approved regional planand the same were to be implemented by several different executing agencies such as the BombayMunicipal Corporation, Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking, The City andIndustrial Development Corporation, the Buildings and Communications Department, the Centraland Western Railways, the Bombay Port Trust and the Department of Civil Aviation. In viewthereof, certain areas were being progressively developed and populated and the necessity wasincreasingly felt for setting up an authority for the purpose of planning, coordinating andsupervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of these areas, in which several localauthorities were separately dealing with such matters within their own jurisdictions.12.3 It was with the aforesaid object in mind, that on 19 th January 1975, the MMRDA Act wasenacted. As per the Preamble of the MMRDA Act, it is an act for forming Brihan Mumbai andShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/14certain areas round-about into a MMR, to provide for the establishment of an authority for thepurpose of planning, coordinating and supervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of theareas in that region and of executing plans, projects and schemes for such development and toprovide for matters connected therewith.12.4             On 26th January 1975, MMRDA was established under Section 3 of theSSP                                                                               20/159                                                                   appl 8104 of 2020.docMMRDA Act inter alia to secure the development of the MMR according to the regional plan and forcarrying out the other purposes of the MMRDA Act. 12.5 In December 1977, MMRDA afterevaluation of two scenarios based on alternative development strategies for the MMR, identified themost desirable pattern of growth called the Optimal Regional Structures and recommended policiesthat, in course of time, would achieve such a structure. The key feature of this Policy was torestructure the existing pattern of development by planned decentralization of economic activitiesthrough measures which prevent growth of offices and wholesale establishments in South Mumbaiand for shifting wholesale markets from the congested parts of the city and developing new growthcenters in the MMR. Some of the growth centers identified in the above policy were Bandra KurlaComplex, New Bombay, Kalyan Complex. The said Policy also recommended creation of two DistrictCenters - one each in eastern and western suburbs.12.6 Based on the aforesaid recommendations, in 1992, a site for the growth centre was identified inthe western suburbs, known as the 'Oshiware District Centre' ("ODC"), being a 102 ha. piece of landsituated near the Western Railway Line, midway between Jogeshwari and Goregaon railwaystations. It covered revenue villages of Oshiwara, Bandivali, Pahadi Goregaon and Goregaon, andforms part of Ward 'K' and 'P' of the Greater Bombay.12.7         Pursuant thereto, MMRDA prepared development proposals underSSP                                                                           21/159                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.docSection 40(3)(d) of the MRTP Act titled 'OSHIWARE DISTRICT CENTRE PLANNINGPROPOSALS' ("Planning Proposal") to structure the planning of the ODC.12.8 The Planning Proposal was sanctioned by the State Government to take effect from 1st March1992 by Government Notification U.D.D. No. TPB- 4391/2885/UD-11 dated 16th January 1992. Asper the Planning Proposal, the predominant activity in the ODC was to have private and publicoffices, offices of professionals and other commercial establishments, business services, high orderretail trade and semi-wholesale markets which would generate employment. ODC was to includeShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/15some residential area to accommodate about 50,000 population. 12.9 Further, as per the PlanningProposal, the development of ODC envisaged guided development of land by landowners'participation. According to the ODC Scheme, the lands were to be acquired by MMRDA from thelandowners for a nominal acquisition price of Re. 1/-. The acquired lands were to be re-released tothe same owners on a 60-year lease for undertaking development as per MMRDA's planningproposals, on payment of lease premium as stipulated Para 6.5.3 of the Planning Proposal. Thelandowners were to be responsible for carrying out all on site infrastructure developments at theircost and are free to sell the buildings/flats in the open market.12.10          On 28th January 1993, the Government of Maharashtra issued aSSP                                                                              22/159                                                                    appl 8104 of 2020.docnotification inter alia for acquisition and vesting of lands with the MMRDA and reserving the saidlands/Notified Areas for the purposes of the ODC. The Notified Area including the Suit Plot.

Accordingly, MMRDA became absolutely seized and possessed of andotherwise well and sufficiently entitled to dispose of the Suit Plot.12.12 Thereafter, the legal heirs of Late Shri Nanji Arjun Rathod, under a Development Agreementdated 18th March 2005, assigned the development rights of the Suit Plot in favour of the Developer.Simultaneous with execution of the Development Agreement, an Irrevocable Power of Attorneydated 18 th March 2005 was also executed in favour of the Developer thereby giving them allnecessary powers required to carry out and complete the construction and development of the SuitPlot in all respects.

Both Buildings wereto be connected SSP 43/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc to each other by podium and that the flatpurchasers had agreed that they shall not restrain the construction of the Additional Building. 12.46On 28th September 2020, the Appellants filed an Interim Application seeking reliefs set out inparagraph 8 hereinabove on the grounds that during the pendency of the Notice of Motion, theDeveloper had obtained a further CC for the Additional Building.12.47 On 1st October 2018, an Order was passed by the Learned Single Judge observing that thepiling work for the Additional Building was being carried out by the Developer and all further workshall be subject to further orders of the Court. 12.48 On 25th November 2020, the Learned SingleJudge, passed the Impugned Order.12.49 On 5th December 2020, being aggrieved by the Impugned Order, the Appellants preferred thepresent Appeal.IMPUGNED ORDER13. By the Impugned Order, the Learned Single Judge dismissed the Notice of Motion and theInterim Application and has held that the provisions of MOFA are expressly excluded againstMMRDA and any provision of MOFA which affects the rights of MMRDA cannot be enforced.Further, by the Impugned Order, the Learned Single Judge has held that the Appellants were atliberty to seek enforcement of obligations of Developer under MOFA but none of these obligationscan cause SSP 44/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc detriment to the rights of MMRDA.13.1 The relevant findings from the Impugned Order are reproduced hereunder :"38. [...] In the present case it is evident that defendant no. 1 has agreed that theMOFA model will be followed and that is what is seen from the contents of the modelwill be followed and that is what is seen from the contents of the agreement and thevarious clauses. To that extent the plaintiff may be right in contending that defendantno. 1 is bound by MOFA. However a distinction needs to be made due to theShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/29involvement of MMRDA. MMRDA is owner of the land. The lands are now leased fora limited period of time. The plaintiffs have made an incorrect statement that theyare absolute owners of the land. MMRDA is also entitled to some constructed area. Inthese circumstances the plaintiffs attempt to enforce provisions of section 7 upondefendant nos 1 to 7 will necessarily prejudice MMRDA as well, because consequentupon the express exclusion of the MOFA in respect of the lands vested in theMMRDA none of the sections of MOFA can be enforced against MMRDA. For thatreason also no relief can be granted to the plaintiff.39. I make it clear that the plaintiffs will always be at liberty to seek enforcement ofother terms of the agreement including the obligations defendant no.1 hasundertaken as provided in MOFA but none of these obligations could entail anyprejudice to MMRDA.Enforcement of clause 7 would detrimentally affect MMRDA rights and MMRDA would also berequired to negotiate with the plaintiffs who may seek further benefits. Considering the fact that theplaintiffs have all executed indemnity bonds referred to above and had complete knowledge of thepossibility of Wing B coming up. The balance of convenience does not favour the plaintiff. Delay inapproaching the Court as dealt with elsewhere in this order must also be held against the SSP45/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc plaintiff. No case is made out for grant of relief and in that view of thematter, the plaintiffs' cannot restrict the rights of the 1st defendant to exploit further FSI as grantedby the MMRDA."(Emphasis Supplied) ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION14. In order to decide the present Appeal, the following issues will have to be considered :ISSUE NO.1 - Whether Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act exclude theapplicability of MOFA as a whole?; or, Whether Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of theMMRDA Act excludes applicability of MOFA only to the extent that it affects the rights of MMRDAbut that MOFA applies as between the developer and the flat purchasers inter se in respect of abuilding constructed on MMRDA leased lands?ISSUE NO.2 - Would the enforcement of Section 7 of MOFA, as sought to be invoked by theAppellants in the present case affect the rights of MMRDA?ISSUE NO.3 - If the applicability of MOFA has been excluded by the MMRDA Act in respect of aproject, can the Developer and flat purchasers contract to incorporate the provisions of MOFA andwould those provisions of MOFA bind the parties inter se?SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES :ISSUE NO.1 - Whether Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the SSP 46/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc MMRDA Act exclude the applicability of MOFA as a whole?; or, Whether Section 31 readShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/30with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act excludes applicability of MOFA only to the extentthat it affects the rights of MMRDA but that MOFA applies as between the developer and the flatpurchasers inter se in respect of a building constructed on MMRDA leased lands?15. Shri Karl Tamboly, Learned Advocate representing the Appellants has made the followingsubmissions :15.1 That a conjoint reading of (i) the heading to Chapter VII of the MMRDA Act (i.e. "ApplicationOf With Or Without Modifications Or Exemption From Certain Enactment To The MetropolitanAuthority"), (ii) the marginal note to Section 31 of the MMRDA Act (i.e. "The enactments mentionedin Schedule II shall apply with or without modifications, or shall not apply to the MetropolitanAuthority, or shall be amended, to the extent and in the manner mentioned in that Schedule") and(iii) Section 31 itself, indicate that the application/non application of the enactments mentioned inSchedule II of the MMRDA Act is meant to operate only in respect of MMRDA, and to no one else.15.2 That a plain reading of these provisions would indicate that the exclusion of MOFA is onlyconfined to MMRDA and not to a private developer which is implementing a project on MMRDAland as obviously, MMRDA as the owner of land cannot be made liable for the obligations of apromoter under MOFA. However, SSP 47/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc significantly, neither Section31 nor Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act exclude the application of MOFA to MMRDA'slessees or developers appointed by MMRDA's lessees.15.3 In fact, this is also MMRDA's understanding as reflected from their letter dated 6th September2017 where they have stated that Section 7 of MOFA cannot be applied to MMRDA as it is not thePromoter. MMRDA has reiterated the aforesaid stand even in their Affidavit in Reply dated 26thNovember 2018 to the Notice of Motion wherein it was stated that MOFA can apply to the Developerupon taking permission of MMRDA. This shows there is no complete exclusion. 15.4 That the word"or" occurring between "land" and "building" in Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRD Act ought to beread as "and". This is inter alia because reading it as "or" leads to incongruous consequences,whereas, reading it as "and" is consistent with the interpretation of Section 31 read with Schedule II,Clause II that the exclusion of MOFA is confined only to MMRDA. If the word "or" is read as it is, itleads to an anomalous situation where a land may belong to MMRDA and the building may not, inwhich case, MOFA will apply to the building and not to the land. Whereas, if the word "or" is read as"and" then the exclusion of MOFA is attracted only when both the land and building belong to orvest in MMRDA, which is consistent with (i) the heading to Chapter VII, (ii) the marginal note toSection 31 and SSP 48/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc(iii) Section 31 itself. In Fakir Mohd. V/s. Sita Ram1 the Supreme Court has held that it ispermissible to read "or" as "and" and vice-versa if some other part of the same statute or thelegislative intent clearly spells out such a requirement. 15.5 That in the present case, the courts mustapply the purposive rule of interpretation and not the literal rule of interpretation to interpretSection 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of MMRDA Act, as the application of the rule of literalinterpretation would lead to absurdity. The absurdity would mean that the beneficial provisions ofMOFA are denied to flat purchasers even as against the Developer. 15.6 MOFA is a beneficialShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/31legislation. It is settled law that a beneficial legislation has to be interpreted in a manner so as tofurther the beneficial object envisaged by the said legislation.15.7 If the MOFA exclusion is extended to the lessee of MMRDA land or to a private developerappointed by such lessee, who comes within the definition of promoter under Section 2(c) of MOFA,the same would lead to manifest absurdity. There is no rational whatsoever for excluding theprotective provisions of MOFA, which are meant to secure and safeguard the rights of flatpurchasers while balancing the rights and interest of the promoter. Further, if the protectiveprovisions contemplated in MOFA qua a developer are excluded, the same will lead to the followingabsurdities :1      (2002) 1 SCC 741SSP                                                                                49/159                                                                     appl 8104 of 2020.doc              (i)     the developer will be able to make every promise to a flatpurchaser thereby making the flat purchaser alter their position by parting with large sums ofmoney for purchasing a flat, and then the developer will simply renege from every such obligationbased on Section 31 of MMRDA Act, thereby leaving the flat purchasers completely helpless.(ii) The developer need not disclose the plans and specifications on the basis of which he intends tocarry out construction, which disclosure is otherwise mandatory under MOFA.(iii) the developer will not be bound by the general obligations imposed on it such as disclosure ofplans specifications, etc.(iv) the developer need not enter into an agreement with the flat purchaser while accepting advancepayment or deposit towards consideration for the flat beyond a certain threshold.(v) the developer can go on carrying out construction indefinitely as and when FSI/TDR becomesavailable due to change in policy, without any freezing point contrary to the representations made tothe flat purchasers at the time of selling the flats.(vi) the developer need not take steps for formation of a cooperative society or company orassociation of flat purchasers or for conveyance of land to the organization of flat purchasers.SSP                                                                             50/159                                                                     appl 8104 of 2020.doc(vii) In the recent enactment of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 ("RERA Act"),MMRDA is covered under the definition of 'Promoter'. Section 17 of the said RERA Act casts a dutyon the said Promoter land owner to execute the conveyance in favour of the body of the flatShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/32purchasers of the "project" registered under the said RERA. If MOFA is held to be inapplicable tothe said Building of the Appellants, then the end result would be the flat purchasers in the saidAdditional Building which is registered under RERA Act, once their society is registered, would getthe conveyance of the entire land including the land upon which the building of the Appellants isconstructed and the Appellants would not have any right in the land.(viii) That the future society of the new purchasers in the said Additional Building can possiblyassert property rights against the Appellants. The garden, recreation area, club house etc. which arepart of the Appellants building presently will not only be used by the flat purchasers in the newbuilding, but they can claim conveyance thereof, as per RERA.15.8 Therefore, all the safeguards inserted in MOFA which are to enure to the benefit of flatpurchasers, will be deprived to a flat purchaser merely because he has chosen to purchase a flat on aplot of land belonging to MMRDA. As such, there is no conceivable difference and/or distinctionbetween a flat purchaser on MMRDA land and a flat purchaser elsewhere, say on land belonging toMaharashtra Housing SSP 51/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc and Area Development Authority("MHADA") or to the MCGM or the State of Maharashtra.15.9 Therefore, the exclusion of MOFA qua a private developer would lead to disastrousconsequences and flat purchasers would be rendered completely helpless and be entirely at themercy of promoters who would leave no stone unturned to maximize their profit even if it be at theexpense and /or to the prejudice of the flat purchasers and their rights. The legislature could havenever intended for such disastrous consequences and therefore, this is fit and proper case to departfrom the literal rule of interpretation of statues in order to balance the rights and obligations of thepromoters, flat purchasers and MMRDA by holding that private developers are bound by MOFAobligations 15.10 The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976 ("MHADA Act") wasintroduced in 1976. The Authority constituted under the MHADA Act i.e. MHADA, is also aPlanning and Development Authority. The functions, objects and purpose of constituting MHADAare identical as that of MMRDA under the MMRDA Act. Both MHADA Act and MMRDA Act containexclusion clauses for non-application of MOFA to both the Authorities and to the land and buildingsbelonging to both the Authorities. Since the language used in Section 190 of the MHADA Act, 1976and Clause II under Schedule II of Section 31 of the MMRDA Act is the same, so far as the exclusionof MOFA is concerned, the SSP 52/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc interpretation and effect of suchexclusion has to be same. Judicial notice must be taken of the fact that the application of MOFA hasnot been excluded qua land owned by MHADA or qua developers constructing real estate projectson MHADA land. The same interpretation and yardstick would have to be applied in respect of landowned by MMRDA.15.11 MOFA Act itself was amended vide MAH No.12 of 1986 wherein Section 18 was substitutedwhich provided that nothing in MOFA shall apply to MHADA and the boards established under theMHADA Act. Significantly, there was no amendment introduced in MOFA to provide a similarexclusion to the MMRDA. This clearly demonstrates that the legislative intent is not to excludeMOFA so far as the flat purchasers are concerned who purchased flats on land belonging toMMRDA. 15.12 The Appellants have relied on the following judgments for the followingShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/33propositions :(i) CWS (India) Ltd V/s.

(S.B)11 - In a suitfiled by flat purchasers of a building on MMRDA land for protection of their rights to additional FSI,MMRDA has impliedly conceded the fact that MOFA is applicable to the MMRDA land and theDeveloper. 15.13 Therefore, the exclusion of MOFA is confined only to MMRDA and the saidexclusion would not extend to a private developer who is promoter within the meaning of Section2(c) of MOFA.16. Shri J P Sen, Learned Senior Advocate representing the Developer has made the followingsubmissions :16.1 That Schedule II to the MMRDA Act does not exclude the applicability of MOFA only toMMRDA but makes MOFA inapplicable to "any land or building belonging to or vesting in"MMRDA. It is an admitted position that the suit land belongs to MMRDA. As such, on a plainreading of Section 31 read with the relevant entry in Schedule II, MOFA has no application to theSuit Plot at all. As such, no question can possibly arise of any provision in MOFA being enforced inShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/34respect of the Suit Plot against either MMRDA or against the Developer, who is merely its agent.16.2            What MOFA does is to modify by statute the incidents of ownership and11     2015 SCC OnLine Bom 723SSP                                                                               55/159                                                                       appl 8104 of 2020.docto impose limitations on the freedom of an owner in the matter of developing his property andcontracting in respect of it. It is clearly the legislative intent that these modifications and limitationswill have no application to any land that is owned by MMRDA.17. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate representing MMRDA (Respondent No. 8) hasmade the following submissions : 17.1 As per the Preamble of the MMRDA Act, it is an act inter aliafor the establishment of an authority for the purpose of planning, coordinating and supervising theproper, orderly and rapid development of the areas in that region and of executing plans, projectsand schemes for such development and to provide for matters connected therewith.17.2 From a perusal of the scheme of the MMRDA Act, it is clear that the MMRDA Act is a completeand a self-contained code to achieve the aforesaid intended object and purpose of the Act.17.3 That the plain meaning of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Actexpresses the clear intention of the legislature to exclude the operation of MOFA as against MMRDAor to any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA.17.4 That as per Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act, excludes MOFA notonly against MMRDA but also to any land or building SSP 56/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc belongingto or vesting in MMRDA. The conscious exclusion of MOFA not only against the MMRDA but also tothe land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA makes it abundantly clear that the intentionof the legislature was to exclude MOFA completely.17.5 That the use of the word "or" in the exclusion or ouster provision is clearly intended to widenthe scope of the exclusion. That the width of the exclusion under the aforesaid provisions is alsoapparent from the use of word "land" because land includes benefits to arise out of land. Therefore,land must be understood as per its wider meaning and applicability of MOFA is excluded as to landas also the benefits arising out of land, belonging to or vesting in MMRDA namely, in this case, FSI.17.6 Another reason to widely construe the exclusion of MOFA is in the choice of expressions '...or toany land or building belonging to or vesting in the Authority'. Belonging to has a wider meaningthan even vesting. This shows that the width of the exclusion is very wide and not confined to onlyMMRDA, as suggested by the Appellants.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/3517.7 That just as much as enacting laws by a competent legislature is within the plenary legislativefunction so also the repeal of legislature or restrictions on the operation of legislature is equally aprimary legislative function. The intention of the legislature in exercising that function has beenexpressed in no uncertain terms by Section 31 read with Schedule II.SSP                                                                              57/159                                                                       appl 8104 of 2020.doc17.8          That in the present case, given that the plain meaning of the aforesaidprovision is clear and unambiguous, there is absolutely no reason to depart from it. 17.9 That therule of purposive interpretation states that when the material words are capable of twointerpretations, the courts must adopt that interpretation which "shall suppress the mischief andadvance the remedy". In the present case even if purposive interpretation of Section 31 read withSchedule II Clause II is considered, it would yield the same result as that obtained by applying literalrule of interpretation of statutes.17.10 The object of the MMRDA Act is inter alia to establish an authority which would provide forplanning, coordinating and supervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of the areas inthat region and of executing plans, projects and schemes for such development. The object of theauthority i.e. MMRDA, so set up, is to secure the development of the MMR. MMRDA in furtheranceof this object supervises projects and even takes part in its execution. It acquires, holds and disposes(by lease) land (which includes benefits arising out of land) for the purposes of carrying out thedevelopment. In order to achieve the aforesaid objective, the legislature has consciously excludedvarious acts other than MOFA or provided for the manner in which they will be applied. This hasbeen done with a view to ensure that the provisions of the MMRDA Act are implemented effectively.Thus, considering the aforesaid object, if MOFA is applied, it would create impediments in the SSP58/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc implementation of the scheme of the MMRDA Act.17.11 For example, if Section 7 and 7A of MOFA are applied to MMRDA or to land or buildingbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA, the consent of the purchasers would be required before utilizingadditional FSI, which FSI does not even belong to them. Further, if MOFA is applied, the consent ofthe purchasers would be required before amending plans, etc. which power exclusively vests inMMRDA. It is inter alia for these reasons, that MOFA has not been made applicable to MMRDA orto any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA. This is keeping in mind the objectssought to be achieved and the purpose intended to be served by the Act and to advance the cause forwhich the enactment is brought into force. 17.12 Therefore, even if the purposive rule ofinterpretation is applied, it still leads to the same result that MOFA would not be applicable toMMRDA or land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA.17.13 The exclusion of MOFA by the MMRDA Act is not unusual. After MHADA Act was enacted in1976, an amendment was carried out to MOFA and Section 18 was added. Section 18 provides thatMOFA shall not apply to MHADA Act. Thus, the exclusion of MOFA under the MMRDA Act isnothing new. This could have been done even by amending MOFA again, like it was done afterShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/36enactment of MHADA Act. However, since MMRDA act excludes a lot of other legislations or appliesthe same with modifications, it is a matter of legislative SSP 59/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docconvenience that instead of amending the Maharashtra Government Premises (Eviction) Act 1956,Land Acquisition Act 1894, etc. what the legislature has deemed it fit to do is that by adding thisprovision i.e. Section 31, indicated how the various acts would or would not apply. Therefore,non-applicability of MOFA to lands or buildings owned by statutory authorities (in the present caseMMRDA) is not new, it is in MOFA itself and is therefore consistent.17.14 That the argument of the Appellants that if literal rule of interpretation is applied to Section 31read with Schedule II, Clause II, it would lead to absurdity is a complete misconception of whatconstitutes an 'absurdity'. An absurdity must be one, which influences the process of statutoryinterpretation and is usually one in which the provisions of an act, if interpreted in a particularmanner 'literally or otherwise' create an irreconcilable contradiction within the Act or defeat thescheme and purpose of that Act itself. In the case of Vasant Ganpat Padave (supra), relied upon bythe Appellants, the Court held that a particular reading of the provisions of that act makes that Actitself unworkable. The argument of absurdity can have no application when the provisions includingthe protection of an Act such as MOFA is made inapplicable by a subsequent legislation.17.15 In this context, the argument of absurdity, allegedly brought about by Section 31 read withSchedule II, could only be made if a plain meaning of those provisions is inherently inconsistentwith the provisions of the same act i.e. the SSP 60/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc MMRDA Act. That isnot even the submission of the Appellant. 17.16 That regardless, of the approach of interpretationone adopts, the choice of language employed by the legislature in Section 31 read with Schedule IIClause II makes it clear that MOFA cannot be made applicable to MMRDA or land or buildingbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA. To permit such application of MOFA would do substantialviolence to the plain or purposive meaning of Section 31 and the statutory scheme of the MMRDAAct and the objectives it seeks to achieve. This would also significantly affect the development ofODC as contemplated under the sanctioned planning proposals which seek to decentralizecommercial spaces in Mumbai and generate employment in the ODC. This would also have acascading impact on the development of various other notified areas where the Authority has beenappointed as the Special Planning Authority.17.17 That the argument of the Appellants that the expression "or" must be read as "and" in ScheduleII, Clause II is again misconceived and against the settled principles of law. The normal rule is that"and" must be read as conjunctive and "or" must be read as disjunctive. There must be compellingreasons to read "or" as "and" as explained above and vice versa. "OR" is a conscious choice. 17.18That during the course of oral arguments, Appellants' had argued that the rule of ejusdem generismust be applied in the present case which is once again misconceived. This rule can be applied whengeneral words in a statutory text are SSP 61/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc flanked by restricted words,the meaning of the general words are taken to be restricted by implication with the meaning ofrestricted words. As from a reading of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDAAct, no contrary intention appear, the rule cannot be applied in the present case to read the words"any land or building vesting in".Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/3717.19 That during the course of oral arguments, Appellants had also argued that this is a case ofcasus ommisus and the courts must read into Section 31 and must supply additional words toSection 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act to mean that MOFA does not apply toMMRDA but would still apply to the Developer (even if the project is on a land belonging toMMRDA). This is not a case of casus ommisus and no words can be added to a statute when theplain meaning is clear and unless clear reasons for it are found within the four corners of the Actitself. 17.20 In response to the Appellants' submission that the exclusion of MOFA, especially afterRERA Act, leads to an irreconcilable situation or 'absurdity' it is important to note that theAppellants have not challenged the vires of either RERA or the MMRDA Act in this regard.17.21 Every legislation is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method.While enacting a law the legislature cannot anticipate all possible effects of how the legislationwould operate.17.22          That no prejudice will be caused to the flat purchasers if MOFA isSSP                                                                                62/159                                                                       appl 8104 of 2020.docexcluded as a whole. In the present case, the Appellants have not alleged that there have beenunauthorized amendments in plans or that the construction is carried out in contravention ofamended plans. Further, nor have the Appellants claimed that the developer has refused to executea registered agreement for the flat purchased by them. Insofar as formation of society is concerned,there is no prohibition in law for a society of flat purchasers to be formed with respect to a buildingconstructed on MMRDA owned land. However, the formation of a society at the behest of thepromoter under MOFA is not the correct approach which has to be adopted for registration of asociety. A proposed society may, with the permission of MMRDA, form a society under theMaharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 ("MCS Act"). However, the Appellants insistence thatthe owner / Respondent No.1 is duty bound to form this society and convey its title to the society offlat purchasers as per MOFA is misconceived and unsustainable given that MOFA is not applicableto such lands. In fact, one such Society viz. Fountain Square Co-operative Society Limited has beenformed by flat purchasers on a land vesting in MMRDA.17.23 What the Appellants seek is virtually an application of RERA to the said Building although theOC for this Wing was granted in 2014, long before the enactment of RERA. The Appellants cannot,by analogy, seek the applicability of legislation which does not, by the very language of thatlegislation, apply.17.24         The Appellants have relied on certain averments made in the Affidavit inSSP                                                                               63/159                                                                        appl 8104 of 2020.docShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/38Reply dated 26th November 2018 filed in the Notice of Motion to contend that even as per MMRDA,the provisions of MOFA were applicable to the Developer. Assuming whilst denying that theAffidavit purports to state that MOFA does not apply to MMRDA but has limited application even asregards lands or buildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA, such a statement can never operateas an estoppel against the application of primary legislation, the plain and purposive meaning ofwhich is clear and unambiguous.17.25 In support of its submissions, Shri Jagtiani has relied upon the following judgments for thefollowing propositions :(i) State of U.P. v. Hindustan Aluminium Corpn. 12 - the power to legislate is both positive in thesense of making a law, and negative in the sense of repealing a law or making it inoperative. But thejudge of the change should be the Legislature, and courts are not expected to undertake that dutyunless that becomes unavoidable and the circumstances are so apparent as to lead to one and onlyone conclusion.(ii) Janhit Manch through its President Bhagvanji Raiyani and Anr. v State of Maharashtra & Ors.13- Policies formulated and legislations made cannot be interfered with, unless they fall foul of theConstitution of India.(iii) B.

The Courtfurther held that it is not proper for the court to depart from the literal rule as that would really beamending the law in the garb of interpretation, which is not permissible.(iv) Ragunath Rai Bareja and Ors. v. Punjab National Bank and Ors.15 - The first and foremostprinciple of interpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation is the literal rule ofinterpretation. The other rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive interpretation etc.can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or lead to no intelligibleresults or if read literally would nullify the very object of the statute.(v) Mathews J Nedumpara and Ors. v Shri Fali S Nariman and Ors.16 - When the words of a statuteare clear, plain or unambiguous and can have only one meaning, the Courts are bound to give effectto that meaning irrespective of the consequence. It is a cardinal principle of interpretation of statutethat the law is to be interpreted in a manner as laid down in the statute book in furtherance to thelegislative intent and not to interpret or give it a meaning which runs contrary to the legislativeintent.(vi) Bharat Bhogilal Patel v Leitz Tooling Systems India Pvt.

Shri Rohaan Cama, Learned Amicus Curiae has made the following submissions :18.1 A perusal of Section 2(c), 2(d), 31 read with Schedule II, would show that under Section 31 thelegislature intended to exclude certain enactments from applying to MMRDA and/or provided thatthe same would apply in amended form to the extent and in the manner set out in the schedule.Accordingly, Schedule II then provides that MOFA would not apply to (i) MMRDA or (ii) any landbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA; or (iii) a building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA. 18.2 Thus,what falls within the exclusion i.e. to which MOFA shall not apply, is to MMRDA itself or to any'land' or 'building' belonging to or vesting in MMRDA. The definition of 'land' includes benefits toarise out of the land, which ex facie includes the FSI potential of the land. It is nobody's case thatMMRDA is not the owner of the land. If that be so, then ipso facto MMRDA is the owner of thebenefits arising out of the subject land i.e. the FSI. The FSI in the present case arising on MMRDAowned/leased land, vests in MMRDA. It follows on a plain and literal reading of Schedule II readwith the definition of 'land', that MOFA will not apply to FSI arising out of the subject land owned /leased by MMRDA. Thus, the Appellants contention that MOFA would apply in full even to landsleased to the owner (or Developer claiming under him) from MMRDA, as all the FSI purportedlyvests in the SSP 68/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Society, since the Developer was required to executea sub-lease in favour of the society. However, this formulation entirely ignores Section 31 read withSchedule II and the definition of 'land' referred to above. There is a clear statutory exclusion of'land', which as aforesaid includes the FSI arising out of the land. This statutory exclusion cannotsimply be ignored, which is effectively what the Appellants seek to do.18.3 In paragraphs 37 to 39 and 66 to 67 of the Plaint, the Appellants have specifically come with acase that the Flat Purchasers acquire rights in the subject land and the additional FSI or any FSIwhatsoever in respect of such lands, which may become available in future, vest in the FlatPurchasers. These averments and prayers sought clearly show that the Appellants, purportedlyexercising rights under Section 7 of MOFA, are seeking to lay claim to FSI arising out of land ownedand leased by MMRDA. This is clearly ex facie in the teeth of the exclusion of MOFA to 'land' i.e. FSIbelonging to / vesting in MMRDA. For the above reasons, it is respectfully submitted that Section 7of MOFA upon which the Appellants place reliance to claim rights to the FSI on the subject MMRDAShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/41owned / leased land, is excluded from applying in the present case by virtue of the statutoryprovisions of Section 31 read with Schedule II.18.4 However, there is a distinction to be drawn between 'land' and 'development', which is definedunder Section 2(c) above. 'Development' inter alia SSP 69/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc includes thecarrying out of any building in, over or under any land and it includes the use of any building or landincluding for any redevelopment. Admittedly, the flats constructed in the subject present case havebeen sold to individual Flat Purchasers. MMRDA is not a party to the sale agreements. It is nobody'scase that MMRDA has any right to the individual flats. It was the submission of MMRDA, that thereis a concept of duality of ownership of the flats/buildings and the underlying land. Therefore, whilethe land may be owned by one person, the ownership of the flat may well lie with another person, asin the present case.18.5 Admittedly, MMRDA does not claim to own the flats. MMRDA's claim is restricted to the landand the FSI arising in respect thereof. Thus, a distinction ought to be drawn between the'development' i.e. the flats constructed on the subject land, and the 'land' itself. Schedule II ex facieon a literal and bare reading, excludes the applicability of MOFA only to the 'land' itself which vestsin MMRDA. However, it is nobody's case that the subject building vests in MMRDA. Even if it wereto be so, admittedly the flats constructed therein do not vest in MMRDA. Thus, the applicability ofMOFA is not excluded under Section 31 read with Schedule II so far as it relates to the developmenti.e. the flats constructed on the subject land. 18.6 It stands to reason, both from a literal reading ofSchedule II, as also a logical, harmonious and balanced assessment of the purpose of the twolegislations i.e. MOFA and MMRDA Act, that the provisions of MOFA were never intended to be SSP70/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc excluded insofar as they apply to the individual flats / flat purchasers.The reason for saying so is as under :(i) MMRDA has no rights in the individual flats, and the flats do not vest in or belong to MMRDA.On a plain reading of Schedule II, the flats themselves were never meant to be excluded from theoperation of MOFA, merely because they happen to have been constructed on land leased fromMMRDA;(ii) The legislature was conscious of separate terms of 'land' under Section 2(d) and 'development'under Section 2(c) of the MMRDA Act. Notwithstanding the separate defined terms, the legislatureconsciously chose not to include 'development' in the exclusion provided in Schedule II. MOFA wasonly intended to be excluded so far as it applied to lands or buildings owned by or vesting inMMRDA, and not to flats which are admittedly owned by the flat purchasers and have nothing to dowith MMRDA.(iii) To contend, as MMRDA did that the term 'land' is so wide as to even include development onthe land, would be doing violence to the statutory provision.(iv) Strictly without prejudice to the fact that on a bare and literal reading of the above statutoryprovisions, the exclusion of MOFA in Schedule II does not apply to flats on MMRDA owned / leasedlands, but only to the 'land' / 'FSI' itself, it is relevant to consider the purpose of the exclusion inShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/42Section 31. The object SSP 71/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc of the MMRDA Act is to regulate planningand orderly development in the metropolitan region. The object is to protect and regulate the rightsof MMRDA and to ensure that MMRDA is in no manner threatened in exploiting its assets. Theseassets include the lands owned by MMRDA and any benefits such as FSI arising therefrom. Theobject of the MMRDA Act was never to affect flats or flat purchasers with which MMRDA has noconnection or interest.(v) The object of the MMRDA Act is not to allow a developer to default or renege on his obligationsto a flat purchaser which has nothing to do with MMRDA whatsoever. There is no conceivablereason as to why those provisions of MOFA which do not relate to MMRDA and which in no manneraffect or prejudice MMRDA and which only relate to the rights in the flat / development, and not inthe land itself, should not apply. This is to say that the exclusion of MOFA is only qua MMRDAlands and not qua flats constructed thereon with which MMRDA has no connection or interest.18.7 There are various provisions of MOFA which would have not the slightest impact on the land orthe rights of MMRDA therein and are purely governing inter se relations between the flat purchasersand the builders which can be applied. For instance :(i) Section 4 of MOFA requires the builder / promoter to enter into a written agreement for sale andregister the same with the Flat Purchaser. There is no SSP 72/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc warrant,either from a reading of the statute, or even logically as to why Section 4 should not be enforced by aflat purchaser against an errant builder, merely because the flat is constructed on MMRDA owned /leased land. MMRDA is in no manner concerned with this.(ii) Section 4, second proviso contains certain statutory provisions entitling a registering officer tocause a summons to be issued to a person to appear before the registration office to admit executionof the document. This statutory benefit available to a party only exists by virtue of its confermentunder MOFA and there is no reason why either the flat purchaser or the builder should be denudedof this statutory benefit merely because the flat is on MMRDA owned / leased land.(iii) Section 5 of MOFA requires the promoter to maintain separate accounts of any sums taken byhim and provides that the Competent Authority under the statute may demand in writing adisclosure of transactions done in respect of that account. Yet again this beneficial provisions is onlyavailable due to applicability of MOFA, and there is no conceivable reason why a builder should notbe bound by this project merely because the project is on MMRDA / leased lands.(iv) Section 6 casts an obligation on the promoter to make payments of outgoings until he transfersthe property to the flat purchaser organisation. This provision protects flat purchasers and in nomanner affects MMRDA. There is no warrant for contending, statutorily or logically, that thisprovisions of MOFA has been SSP 73/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc excluded merely because the flatsare on MMRDA owned / leased land.(v) Section 7 as stated above has been relied upon by the Appellants to claim rights to FSI on thesubject lands. This clearly relates to the 'land' owned by or vesting in MMRDA and therefore mustShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/43correctly be treated as being excluded by Schedule II of the MMRDA Act.(vi) The other provisions of MOFA such as Section 8 which provide for a refund by the builder fordelayed construction, or the obligation under Section 10 for a promoter to take steps to form aco-operative housing society, have nothing to do with any claim on the 'land' / 'FSI' of MMRDA, andtherefore not covered by the exclusion under Schedule II, MOFA ought to apply to enable flatpurchasers to exercise their rights to refund or for formation of a society.(vii) Most pertinently, under Sections 12 and 13 of MOFA, there are certain penal provisions fornon-compliance by the flat purchasers or the promoters. Such penal provisions act as statutorychecks and balances to ensure compliance with the provisions of MOFA. These beneficentprovisions are available under MOFA to inter alia ensure that flat purchasers are not kept out oftheir homes and on the street while errant builders take advantage of them.18.8 In the present case, Section 31 read with Schedule II seeks to exclude the beneficent legislationof MOFA and therefore must be strictly construed as applying the exclusion only to the extentspecifically and narrowly set out in Schedule II. That is SSP 74/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc to say theexclusion should be restricted to what is stated therein i.e. land or building owned by or vesting inMMRDA and ought not to be made applicable to flats with which MMRDA has no right or interest.If this interpretation is adopted, it will sub- serve the interest of MMRDA without depriving flatpurchasers of statutory rights under MOFA, which have nothing to do with MMRDA's land,buildings or rights therein.18.9 The aforesaid interpretation given above attempts to strike just such a balance between thevarious competing interests of MMRDA and the flat purchasers, while having regard to the objectand subject of the two legislations i.e. MOFA and the MMRDA Act.18.10 The Amicus Curiae has relied upon the following judgments in support of his submissions andon the following propositions :(i) Nahalchand Laloochand Private Limited v. Panchali Co- operative Housing Society Limited24 - Aflat is a self-contained unit, which is structurally divided and separately owned within a largerbuilding. The flats in question are separately owned by the flat purchasers and MMRDA has noconnection therewith.(ii) State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao Andolan & Anr.25 - Statutory provisions must beread in a manner so as to do justice to all the parties.

The court must have regard to the subject matter of the statute as also the objectthereof and the policy underlying the same. The underlying idea is balanced and to give aconstruction which is agreeable to reason and justice to all the parties concerned, avoiding injustice,irrationality, mischievous consequences, unnecessary hardship, serious inconvenience or anomaly.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/44(iii) M. Nizamudeen v. Chemplast Sanmar Limited & Ors. 26 - If an exception has been added itshould be construed in a manner that it remedies the mischief. Construction should be given whichis in harmony with the purpose of the statute.(iv) Sheikh Gulfan & Ors. v. Sanat Kumar Ganguli 27 - When interpreting a statute it is oftennecessary to have regard to the subject matter of the statute and the object which it is intended toachieve, and not merely place exclusive reliance on the bare dictionary meaning of the words. It wasfurther held that a provision of a statute which creates an exception or an exclusion (akin to Section31 read with Schedule II in the present case) must be strictly construed especially if it creates anexception to the applicability of a beneficent legislation.19. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate representing MMRDA (Respondent No. 8) inRejoinder to the Arguments advanced by the Amicus Curiae, 26 (2010) 4 SCC 240 (Paragraph 38)27 AIR 1965 SC 1835 (Paragraphs 9, 10, 18, 23 and 28) SSP 76/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc made thefollowing submissions :19.1 The application of MOFA to lands or buildings (or flats constructed in buildings) belonging toor vesting in MMRDA, even in the limited manner suggested by the Amicus Curiae, will doconsiderable violence to the plain meaning of the language used in Section 31 of the MMRDA Act. Aplain reading of Section 31 read with Schedule II to the MMRDA Act shows that the exclusion ofMOFA as against MMRDA or to any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA is absolute.Therefore, if the land or building in question belongs to or vests in MMRDA, the application ofMOFA stands excluded.19.2 Clause II of Schedule II to the MMRDA Act reads "The said Act [MOFA] shall not apply..."without any reservation or qualification. This is in contrast with the Bombay Government Premises(Eviction) Act, 1955, the provisions of which are modified in their application to MMRDA asmentioned in Schedule II to the MMRDA Act. To read down Section 31 and Schedule II to theMMRDA Act to mean that only 'some' provisions of MOFA shall not apply to MMRDA or to lands orbuildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA whereas other provisions of MOFA would apply, doesviolence to the plain meaning of Section 31 read with Clause II of Schedule II of the MMRDA Act.19.3 If the intention of the legislature was to make certain provisions of MOFA applicable to land orbuildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA or to flats SSP 77/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docconstructed in such buildings, the legislature could easily have modified the provisions of MOFA inits application to MMRDA lands as is done for the Bombay Government Premises (Eviction) Act,1955. That the legislature has not done so is an important indicator of the legislative intent ofmaking the exclusion of MOFA absolute. 19.4 MOFA is not the sole repository of flat purchasers'rights. These rights exist in various forms under different legislations, such as the Transfer ofProperty Act, 1882, the Contract Act, 1872, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (now ConsumerProtection Act, 2019), Specific Relief Act, 1963 to name a few. There is evidently no vacuum in thelaw as other common law and statutory remedies available to flat purchasers remain available.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/4519.5 The Amicus Curiae's submission that the exclusion of MOFA is only with respect to lands orbuildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA and that MOFA will continue to apply to 'development'(as defined in MMRDA Act) OR 'flats' (as defined in MOFA) owned by flat purchasers is untenable.The definition of 'development' draws colour from Section 12 of the MMRDA Act. 19.6 Thedefinition of 'development' in Section 2(c) of the Act covers various activities including the carryingout of building or making of any material change in the land or building or in the use of any buildingor land. It is therefore an activity in relation to a land or building.19.7          The submission of the Amicus that MOFA is excluded against lands orSSP                                                                               78/159                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.docbuildings belonging to or vesting in MOFA but nevertheless applies to 'development' carried out orundertaken on such lands or buildings is contrary to the definition of 'development' and also thedefinition of 'land' which includes 'benefits to arise out of land and things attached to the earth orpermanently fastened to anything attached to the earth'. Thus the building also may be included as apart of land itself. The exclusion in Section 31 of the MMRDA Act would therefore excludedevelopment on the land and the building standing on the land where such land is owned byMMRDA. 19.8 The Amicus Curiae does not explain how the applicability of Sections 4, 8 and 10even as between the flat purchasers and the developers is not an application of MOFA to land orbuilding belonging to or vesting in MMRDA, an application which is expressly prohibited by theMMRDA Act. This submission also contradicts the submission that exclusion of MOFA does notapply to 'development' or 'flats'. If the Amicus Curiae is correct in his submission that MOFAcontinues to apply to 'development' and 'flats', there is no explanation offered as to why suchapplication is nevertheless truncated and only Sections 4, 8 and 10 of MOFA should apply. 19.9 Theeffect of the Amicus' submissions is that selective provisions of MOFA will continue to operate onMMRDA lands, a circumstance expressly excluded by statute. Even otherwise, this exercise wouldnecessarily require identifying why other provisions would not apply and the rationale for suchnon-application. 19.10 The Appellants and Amicus Curiae have argued that the non-SSP                                                                              79/159                                                                        appl 8104 of 2020.docapplicability of MOFA will lead to yet another absurdity namely the inability to register a society ofpurchasers as required under Section 10 of MOFA. Section 10(1) of MOFA is essentially anobligation on the promoter to submit an application to the registrar for registration of the personswho take the flats as a cooperative society or as a company. The proviso to Section 10(1) provides fora remedy for a situation where it does apply by empowering the competent authority to direct theoffice of the registrar to register a society. Section 10(2) of MOFA contemplates a condominiumunder the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act as an alternative to a society under Section 10(1)of MOFA. The provisions of Section 10 of MOFA do not govern the formation of a society or anShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/46association of persons generally but are directed towards the promoter of a project under MOFAtaking on this obligation. 19.11 The application for registration of Society has to be made to theRegistrar of Societies under Section 8 and Section 9 of the MCS Act read with Rule 10(5) of theMaharashtra Co-operative Housing Societies Rules, 1961. The flat purchasers are at liberty to makesuch application for formation of Society. 19.12 There is nothing in the MCS Act or the MMRDA Actwhich precludes the formation of a society from amongst purchasers / allottees of flats even if thereis no sub-lease or direct interest in the land existing in favor of the proposed society. 19.13 Thisequity based and 'no prejudice' based application of MOFA would then extend to all cases of projectsbeing developed on MMRDA land. The danger in SSP 80/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc thisinterpretation is that it is difficult to foresee how in different fact situations this understanding willbe applied. That is precisely why, and to avoid this uncertainty, the provisions of the MMRDA Actare excluded altogether.19.14 As held by the Supreme Court in various judgments, the effect of repealing or restricting theapplication of a statute is to obliterate it completely from the records of the legislature as if it hadnever been passed; and it must be considered as a law that never existed except for the purpose ofthose actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law.MOFA, insofar as it concerns land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA, stands completelyexcluded.19.15 In so far as the Amicus Curiae's argument that this submission has found favour with theLearned Single Judge, MMRDA submits that it is not aggrieved by the final and operative Order ofthe Learned Single Judge in dismissing the interim applications filed by the Appellants. Hence, noappeal was filed by MMRDA. However, since this Appeal Court is considering all aspects of thematter even beyond the FSI related issues canvassed by the Appellant, it is open to MMRDA tocontend that the observations of Learned Single Judge in Paragraphs 38-39 of the Impugned Orderare incorrect as a matter of law while at the same time supporting the final order of dismissal of theinterim application filed by the Plaintiffs / Appellants.19.16         Shri Jagtiani has relied upon the following judgments in support of hisSSP                                                                                81/159                                                                         appl 8104 of 2020.docaforesaid submissions and the following propositions :(i) Raghunath Rai Bareja v Punjab National Bank & Ors. 28 - When there is a conflict between thelaw and equity, it is the law that has to prevail.(ii) D C Bhatia & Ors. v Union of India & Anr. 29 - It is for the Legislature to decide which particularsection of people require protection at any given point of time.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/47(iii) Martin Burn Ltd. v Corporation of Calcutta 30 - A result flowing from a statutory provision isnever an evil.

It has consistently been held that,"inconvenience is not" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute.20. Shri Rohaan Cama, in Sur-Rejoinder has made the following submissions:20.1 It is sought to be contended by the Developer and MMRDA that the Amicus was asking thisCourt to minutely analyse which provisions of MOFA would apply and which would not. This is notat all correct. The above provisions of MOFA have been analysed only illustratively to demonstratethat there are various provisions of MOFA (i) which have no co-relation to MMRDA 'land' as definedand are thus not excluded from a bare / literal reading of Section 31 read with Schedule II, (ii) whichought to and must be treated as enforceable by flat purchasers against Developer, failing which alarge body of flat purchasers on MMRDA owned /leased lands would be left at the mercy of errantbuilders; and (iii) for which there is absolutely no statutory or logical reason for excluding theapplicability of MOFA, as the said provisions have absolutely nothing to do with MMRDA but onlygovern inter se relations between the flat purchasers and the Developers. 20.2 This Court may,should it so choose, simply declare that the provisions of MOFA so far as they relate to 'land' ofMMRDA as defined under Section 2(d) will not apply, but the provisions of MOFA will continue toapply to all other aspects of a development project which do not affect the 'land' / FSI of MMRDA.This SSP 83/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc declaration alone would suffice and it would thereafter beopen to subsequent courts, if and when an occasion arose, on the facts of each case, to analysewhether a particular provision of MOFA affected 'land' of MMRDA or not. This Court is not beingcalled upon to carry out any such exercise in the present case. 20.3 Merely because a society may beregistered under the Maharashtra Co- operative Societies Act, 1960, is no answer for excludingsection 10 of MOFA. Section 10 carries with it the attendant benefit of penal consequences underSection 13 if the promoter fails to comply. Merely because the society may otherwise be registered isno reason to exclude MOFA.20.4 It is not the submission that a literal reading of Schedule II excludes MOFA entirely. On thecontrary, it is the stand of the Amicus that upon a bare reading of Schedule II, it only excludes theapplicability of MOFA to MMRDA 'land' and does not exclude the applicability of MOFA to the flatsconstructed on the 'land' and the inter se obligations between the flat purchasers and the builders.This stand is based on only a literal reading of Schedule II.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/4820.5 The judgments relied upon by him (the Amicus Curiae), referred to above, do not suggest that apurposive interpretation be taken as much as they clarify that a statute must be read in the contextof the object and purport of the legislation and what mischief was sought to be remedied. It is in thatcontext that the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated while interpreting or reading a statutoryprovision, that a SSP 84/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc balanced approach must be adopted, which willsub-serve the object of the legislation in question. The Supreme Court has further held that whentwo legislations are been looked at every attempt must be made to strike a balance between theobject of both the legislations. The stand taken by him ( the Amicus Curiae) referred to above seeksto balance the interest of MMRDA so that it is not fettered in its exploitation of its land / FSI, whilesimultaneously avoiding Flat Purchasers being deprived of statutory benefits of MOFA, which in nomanner, shape or form relate to MMRDA land or affect MMRDA in any manner whatsoever. This isin consonance with the object of MOFA to avoid exploitation of Flat Purchasers as held by theSupreme Court in Nahalchand (supra).20.6 Furthermore, there are various provisions of MOFA, some of which are referred to above (suchas Section 4 vesting power in the registering officer, Section 5 requiring the promoter to maintainaccounts, Section 13 relating to penal provisions etc.), which can only apply by virtue of theirstatutory conferment. Such provisions which vest powers in statutory authorities and provide forpenalties could never form the subject matter of a contract between the Flat Purchasers and thebuilder. Thus, absent MOFA, these beneficial provisions would not and could not be available to aflat purchaser. There are also various statutory provisions in MOFA such as penalty which cannotand do not find place in the lease deed. These statutory benefits would not be available to the FlatPurchasers and therefore the Lease Deed cannot be said to SSP 85/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc besufficient protection as would justify excluding the applicability of MOFA. 20.7 Even otherwise, theflat purchasers are not parties to the lease deed and they would in no manner be able to or entitle toenforce the same. Thus, there would be no ability on the part of the Flat Purchasers to approach acourt and enforce the terms of the lease Deed as they would ex facie lack any privity of contract to doso.ISSUE NO.2 - Would the enforcement of Section 7 of MOFA, as sought to be invoked by theAppellants in the present case affect the rights of MMRDA?21. Shri Karl Tamboly, Learned Advocate representing the Appellants has made the followingsubmissions :21.1 Clauses 6.5.2 and 7.2.6 of the Planning Proposal provides that the lands acquired by MMRDAhave to be leased in favour of the original owners for 60 years for undertaking development againstpayment of prescribed lease premium. The original land owner/lessee would be free to sell theconstructed buildings in the open market. This makes it ex facie clear that it is only the original landowner/lessee who is permitted to exploit the FSI of the land as permitted by MMRDA who is alsothe planning authority. Why such original land owner/lessee should be excluded from theapplicability of MOFA is the question before this Court and one for which no credible answer isgiven by MMRDA.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/4921.2 It is also clear that there is nothing in the ODC as to why the relationship between the lessee /Developer of such leased land and the flat purchasers should not SSP 86/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docbe regulated by the provisions of MOFA and the said application of MOFA is in no way prejudicial tothe rights and interest of MMRDA, as all that MMRDA is entitled to is to receive the premium asprovided in Para-6.5.3 of the said ODC Scheme. 21.3 The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is notmentioned under Schedule II of Section 31 of the MMRD Act, 1974 so as to exclude its applicabilityto the land leased by MMRDA in favour of its lessees which in the facts of this case qua the suitproperty is Mr. Bhupendra Nanji Rathod under the said Lease Deed. By virtue of the provisionscontained in Transfer of Property Act, the Lessee is entitled to transfer his lease hold rights in theunderlaying land by way of mortgage, sub-lease, assignment etc, to any third party. The same is infact provided under clause 3(p) of the said Lease Deed.21.4 A reading of Sections 105, 107 and 108 of TOPA Act makes it clear that a lessee of the land cansub lease its rights therein. The argument by the Respondents that MMRDA land cannot beconveyed in terms of section 11 of MOFA is belied by the provisions of the TOPA read with the saidLease Deed. Applying the test of MOFA to the present case, all that it would require is for theDeveloper as the Constituted Attorney of the lessee to either assign or sublease (with MMRDApermission against payment of premium as contemplated by Clause 3(p) of the lease deed) thelessees rights in the suit land in favour of the society / association of flat purchasers in the projectfor the unexpired period of the lease. The rights of MMRDA SSP 87/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc asthe owner of the land would remain intact.21.5 Clause 2(p) of the said Lease Deed in respect of the Suit Plot, permits the Lessee to assign hisright and interest in the said Suit Plot, subject to the terms and conditions stated therein.21.6 In Clause 14 of the Agreement for Sale of flats executed by the Developer with the Appellants, itis promised that after completion of their residential building, the Developer will transfer the leasehold rights to co-operative society formed for the building.21.7 In one particular case which the Appellants have been able to find out, MMRDA has consentedfor formation of a society of flat purchasers on land which is owned by it, even before the buildingscould be constructed in the case of Fountain Square Residents and Welfare Association, Mumbai,Sonata Realty against Developer Sonata Realty Pvt Ltd. and against another developer Shri SubhBuilders Pvt Ltd. In this case the MMRDA had transferred the lease hold rights in the land bearingSurvey No.41/1A, and CTS No.1 C/3A part situated at Village-Oshiwara, Mumbai, under a registeredLease Deeds dated 01 st April, 2008, 25th June, 2009 and 22nd March, 2010 in favour of theDeveloper M/s Sonata Realty Pvt. Ltd. For non- construction of the said building, around 480 flatpurchasers had filed Suit No.2294 of 2010, Suit no.753 of 2016, Suit no.189 of 2017 in this Courtwherein MMRDA is also a party and all these suits are specifically filed under the provisions ofMOFA for SSP 88/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc enforcement of the rights in the land and building.MMRDA after fully knowing that these suits are filed under the provisions of MOFA, has issuedNOC for formation of the society as contemplated under the provisions of MOFA, and the said NOCletter dated 15-07202020 is produced on record.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/5022. Shri J P Sen, Learned Advocate representing the Developer has made the following submissions:22.1 Section 7 of MOFA has the effect, inter alia, that an owner will not be entitled, in the absence ofconsent from the flat purchasers, to carry out any further construction on the land owned by him. Ifthe Appellants were entitled to enforce their purported rights under Section 7, it would enable themto prevent any further construction on the Suit Plot. This would clearly prejudice the right ofMMRDA as the owner to carry out such construction, by themselves or through their Agent, namely,the Developer. This is particularly so since they benefit both in terms of premium and constructedarea in the on-going construction which the Appellants seek to injunct.22.2 On the other hand, if the argument is that Section 7 would prevent only this Developer fromconstructing on the Suit Plot while MMRDA would be free to carry out the construction throughsome other Developer, it would amount to a reductio ad absurdum. There is no conceivable reasonwhy MMRDA who is admittedly free from the constraints of MOFA and entitled to consume anyremaining FSI on the SSP 89/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc suit land ought not to be entitled to do sothrough any Agency of its choice including the Developer herein. As such, the proposition that theinjunction sought by the Appellants against Developer would not prejudice MMRDA appears to beclearly insupportable.23. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Advocate representing MMRDA has made the followingsubmissions :23.1 The protection under Section 7 of FSI for the benefit of a Society is premised on the legislativeintent for the society to eventually obtain a conveyance of the land. The sequitur is that if a society isnot entitled to a conveyance of the land, it cannot claim any right to exploitation of FSI, which is abenefit attached to rights held in the land by virtue of a conveyance.23.2 In the present case, the provisions of the MMRDA Act, do not entitle the Appellants to aconveyance of the land and therefore Section 7 of MOFA is wholly inapplicable.23.3 On the contrary, Clause 15 of the Agreement for Sale recognizes that the flat purchasers will nothave any right in the FSI available with respect to the Suit Plot as at the end of the leased period theleasehold rights revert back to MMRDA unless further extended. Therefore, as per the scheme of theMMRDA Act, MMRDA retains ownership of the Suit Plot and all benefits arising from the Suit Plot,including FSI.SSP                                                                                90/159                                                                     appl 8104 of 2020.doc23.4         The Appellants or association of flat purchasers are not, as a matter oflaw, entitled to any FSI arising out of the Suit Plot as they are not entitled to aconveyance/assignment of leasehold rights in the Suit Plot. To make MOFA applicable in thisShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/51scenario would do considerable violence to the legislative provisions contained in the MMRDA Actand the provisions of the said Lease Deed which are known to the Appellants.23.5 Any restraint or fetter on MMRDA on how MMRDA may permit the utilization of FSI based onMOFA is effectively a fetter on MMRDA's rights as a planning authority and landowner.23.6 If Section 7 and Section 7A or other provisions are made applicable to lands or buildingsbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA (albeit not against MMRDA directly), the same would affect thevarious rights of MMRDA and also impede the ability of the MMRDA to exercise the various powersgranted to it under the MMRDA Act which includes the right to permit the exploitation of its FSI inthe manner it deems fit. If Section 7 is made applicable, MMRDA would be required to obtainconsent of the flat purchasers before granting such permissions, which is not what has beencontemplated under the MMRDA Act. The powers of the MMRDA are absolute and cannot besubjected to the mercy of the flat purchasers. 23.7 To hold otherwise would run contrary to theestablished principle of dual ownership and will otherwise do considerable violence to the plainmeaning of SSP 91/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Section 31 the MMRDA Act. Further, granting aninjunction to the Appellants on the strength of Clause 28 of the Agreement for Sale (which makesMOFA applicable to Respondent No.1's obligations) would also defeat and render otiose theprovisions of the Lease Deed dated 15 July 2008.23.8 MMRDA, as a special planning authority, has the power and prerogative to determine themanner in which the ODC is to be developed. It is for this reason that the MMRDA Act containsprovisions such as Section 14 of the MMRDA Act. To hold that MOFA is applicable to lands orbuildings belonging to or vesting in the MMRDA will affect and restrict the powers of MMRDA todetermine the manner in which notified areas within its jurisdiction are developed. Further, everychange required by MMRDA in layouts and plans (which it is otherwise free to direct as per Section14 of the MMRDA Act and as per the provisions of the lease deed) would then become subject topurchaser consents, which will undoubtedly impede MMRDA's mandate to expeditiously andeffectively regulate the development of lands within its jurisdiction. 23.9 Any apprehension thatprotections available under MOFA will no longer be available to flat purchasers is also not a validconcern. There is no prohibition in the MMRDA Act which restricts the purchasers to contractuallydetermine the timelines for delivery of flats, the consequences of default, and other commercialterms which concerns are raised by the Appellants. The Lease deed in fact empowers the MMRDA toterminate the lease if the owner fails to construct the building within the prescribed SSP 92/159 appl8104 of 2020.doc timelines.24. Shri Rohaan Cama, Learned Amicus Curiae has made the following submissions :24.1 Section 7 of MOFA upon which the Appellants place reliance to claim rights to the FSI on thesubject MMRDA owned/leased land, is excluded from applying in the present case by virtue of thestatutory provisions of Section 31 read with Schedule II. Under the MMRDA Act, the definition of'land' includes benefits to arise out of the land, which ex facie includes the FSI potential of the land.It is nobody's case that MMRDA is not the owner of the land. If that be so, then ipso facto MMRDAis the owner of the benefits arising out of the subject land i.e. the FSI. Thus, the FSI in the presentShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/52case arising on MMRDA owned / leased land, vests in MMRDA. It follows on a plain and literalreading of Schedule II and the definition of 'land', that MOFA will not apply to FSI arising out of thesubject land owned / leased by MMRDA.24.2 These averments and prayers in the Suit, clearly show that the Appellants are purportedlyexercising rights under Section 7 of MOFA and are seeking to lay claim to FSI arising out of landowned and leased by MMRDA. This is clearly ex facie in the teeth of the exclusion of MOFA to 'land',i.e. FSI, belonging to/vesting in MMRDA, and ought not to be permitted as the same wouldprejudice MMRDA.ISSUE NO.3 - If the applicability of MOFA has been excluded by SSP 93/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docthe MMRDA Act in respect of a project, can the Developer and flat purchasers contract toincorporate the provisions of MOFA and would those provisions of MOFA bind the parties inter se?25. Shri Karl Tamboly, Learned Advocate representing the Appellants has made the followingsubmissions :25.1 A bare perusal of Clause 28 clearly indicates, that, the Developer has agreed to be bound byobligations under the provisions of MOFA and the rules framed thereunder. Having agreed to thesaid stipulation it is not open to the Developer to renege from the said obligation which is bothcontractual and statutory in nature. 25.2 Unlike the MOFA which specifically has a provision(Section 16) which provides that the Act will prevail over any contract, the MMRDA Act has no suchprovision. Hence, Clause 28 of the flat purchase agreement where the Developer has agreed that theagreement as regards the Developer's obligations shall be subject to the provisions of MOFA, is notvoid and/or invalidated by any provision of MMRDA Act and the same would continue to bind theDeveloper and would represent a binding contract between the flat purchaser and the developer.25.3 Clause 14.1 of Agreement for sale states that after completion of the Tower, Developer willtransfer the lease hold rights to co-operative society formed for the building.25.4            Assuming without admitting, that, MOFA does not apply to land vestedSSP                                                                             94/159                                                                        appl 8104 of 2020.docin MMRDA, the Developer had an option to not subject himself to obligations under MOFA; despitethat, he has voluntarily chosen to be bound by MOFA obligations. Therefore, the Developer haselected to be bound by MOFA and the rules framed thereunder. Having so elected, the Developercannot approbate/reprobate qua the same contract, especially after having obtained benefitsthereunder. 25.5 The Developer has dealt with the Appellants contention of Clause 28 in a barecryptic manner in Paragraph 16 of the Affidavit in Reply to Notice of Motion by stating that the flatpurchaser agreements are "specimen Agreements for Sale". This contention is misconceived sincethere are several features in the agreement for sale which are not part of a standard flat purchaserShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/53agreement, and this belies the developer's said contention.25.6 The Developer despite agreeing to be bound by MOFA obligations in the flat purchaseagreements is seeking to renege from the same. The Developer is thus approbating/reprobating quathe same document. The Developer cannot blow hot and cold at the same time. The Developerhaving agreed to be bound by MOFA obligations is estopped from contending otherwise.25.7 Shri Tamboly relies upon the following judgments in support of his submissions and on thefollowing propositions :(i) Nutan Kumar V/s. Additional District Judge 32 - Unless a statute 32 (2002) 8 SCC 31 SSP 95/159appl 8104 of 2020.doc specifically provides that a contract is contrary to the provisions of thestatute and is void, the contract would remain binding between the parties.(ii) C.

The said clause, which is part ofthe standard format agreement executed by the Developer, does refer to the obligations of theDeveloper being subject to the provisions of MOFA and the rules made there under.26.2 In any event, neither the Appellants nor the Developer are entitled in law to contract out ofSection 31 read with Schedule II of MMRDA Act which is enacted for the benefit of the developmentauthority nor are they entitled to make the provisions of MOFA applicable to the Suit Plot when theprovisions of that Act have been expressly excluded by the MMRDA Act. MMRDA has certainly notconsented to the applicability of the provisions of MOFA to the plot in question. Indeed, it could nothave done so.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/5427. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate representing MMRDA (Respondent No. 8) hasmade the following submissions : 27.1 Applicability of MOFA inter se between the Developer andflat purchasers would undermine the statute i.e. the MMRDA Act. 27.2 Once the applicability ofMOFA has been excluded by a statute, the parties cannot incorporate the same by a privateagreement. 27.3 Under the Agreements for Sale, the Appellants were always aware that the terms ofthe Agreement for Sale were subject to the said Lease Deed and therefore to the MMRDA Act.Having entered into the said Agreements for Sale with the said SSP 97/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docknowledge, the flat purchasers cannot now seek to enforce the provisions of MOFA inter se to whichMMRDA is not a party and the application of which will affect MMRDA. If this Court allows suchenforcement it would defeat the terms of the said Lease Deed and in turn the provisions and theMMRDA Act.FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS :28. ISSUE NO. 1: Whether Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act excludesthe applicability of MOFA as a whole?; or, Whether Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of theMMRDA Act excludes applicability of MOFA only to the extent that it affects the rights of MMRDAbut that MOFA applies as between the Developer and the flat purchasers inter se in respect of abuilding constructed on MMRDA leased lands?28.1 MMRDA Act was enacted much after MOFA was already in force. Therefore, the legislaturewould deemed to have been conscious of the provisions of MOFA.28.2 The determination of the aforesaid issue revolves around the interpretation of Section 31 readwith Schedule II, Clause II of MMRDA Act. However, before we consider the interpretation of theaforesaid provisions, it is necessary to consider the circumstances in which the MMRDA Act wasenacted, its object and certain relevant provisions thereof.28.3              The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the MMRDA Act statesSSP                                                                         98/159                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.docthat on 2nd June 1973, the Bombay Metropolitan Regional Plan prepared by the BombayMetropolitan Regional Board (constituted by the State Government under the MaharashtraRegional and Town Planning Act, 1966) was approved by the State Government and the said Plancame into force on 16th August 1973. The Regional Planning Board was not the authority forimplementing the proposals in the approved regional plan and the same were to be implemented byseveral different executing agencies such as the Bombay Municipal Corporation, Bombay ElectricSupply and Transport Undertaking, The City and Industrial Development Corporation, theBuildings and Communications Department, the Central and Western Railways, the Bombay PortTrust and the Department of Civil Aviation. 28.4 In view thereof, certain areas were beingShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/55progressively developed and populated and the necessity was increasingly felt for setting up anauthority for the purpose of planning, coordinating and supervising the proper, orderly and rapiddevelopment of these areas, in which several local authorities were separately dealing with suchmatters within their own jurisdictions.28.5 It was with the aforesaid object in mind that the MMRDA Act was enacted.28.6 As per the Preamble of the MMRDA Act, it is an act for forming Brihan Mumbai and certainareas round-about into a Mumbai Metropolitan Region, to provide for the establishment of anauthority for the purpose of planning, coordinating SSP 99/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc andsupervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of the areas in that region and of executingplans, projects and schemes for such development and to provide for matters connected therewith.28.7 After commencement of the MMRDA Act, the State Government by notification published inthe Official Gazette, established the Authority i.e. MMRDA under Section 3 of the MMRDA Act interalia to secure the development of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region according to the regional planand for carrying out the other purposes of the MMRDA Act. In addition to the aforesaid, theAuthority is also deemed to be a 'local authority' within the meaning of the term 'local authority' asdefined in the Maharashtra General Clauses Act.28.8 MMRDA is a body corporate, having perpetual succession and a common seal, with power,subject to the provisions of this Act, to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable andimmovable, and to contract. For disposal of land (which include benefits to arise out of land andthings attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth) held byMMRDA, MMRDA is required to follow the procedure prescribed under the Mumbai MetropolitanRegion Development Authority (Disposal of Land) Regulations, 1977 ("Disposal of LandRegulations"). As per Regulation 3 of the Disposal of Land Regulations, "the Authority may disposeof any land by lease to be granted in consideration of premium or rent or both for a term notexceeding 80 years and in accordance with these Regulations".SSP                                                                                100/159                                                                         appl 8104 of 2020.docMMRDA is also a Special Planning Authority under Section 40 of the MRTP Act. 28.9 The mandateof the MMRDA under the MMRDA Act is manifold:(i) it is a Planning Authority for the areas under its jurisdiction and, in that capacity, it regulates andsupervises development; (ii) it also acts to execute by itself, projects and schemes, for orderly andrapid development of the areas within its jurisdiction; (iii) it is the owner of lands and in thatcapacity has the power to lease the land with the objective of development being carried out on suchlands. This, in turn may be in consideration for rent or premium and undoubtedly, the monetizationof land by way of rents and premium generates revenue for implementing the mandate and objectiveof the MMRDA Act by MMRDA; and (iv) it grants loans and also finances projects under itsjurisdiction.

It isnot in dispute that the ODC in which the Suit Plot is located, is a project which is being implementedby MMRDA.29. We shall now consider the issue with respect to the interpretation of Section 31 read withSchedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act in terms and keeping in mind the object and purpose ofthe MMRDA Act.29.1            Plain Meaning of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of theShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/60SSP                                                                                           106/159                                                                                   appl 8104 of 2020.docMMRDA Act :"Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act, reads as follows:"31 - The enactments mentioned in Schedule II shall apply, with or without modifications, or shallnot apply to the Metropolitan Authority, or shall be amended, to the extent and in the mannermentioned in that Schedule."          "          Schedule II [See Section 31]          [...]II. The Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the promotion of construction, sale,management and transfer) Act, 1963 (Mah XLV of 1963). The said Act shall not apply to theMetropolitan Authority or to any land or building belonging to or vesting in that Authority." 29.2From a plain reading of the aforesaid language contained in Section 31 read with Schedule II, ClauseII of the MMRDA Act, it is evident that the exclusion of MOFA by MMRDA Act applies in two ways :(i) MOFA does not apply to MMRDA;(ii) MOFA does not apply to any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA.29.3 From the aforesaid plain meaning it is clear that the width of the exclusion of MOFA toMMRDA Act is wide and not restrictive. 29.4 The non-applicability of MOFA is relatable to twodistinct events, namely (i) that it will not apply against MMRDA as a statutory authority meaningthat rights or obligations under MOFA will not be enforceable as against MMRDA; (ii) it SSP107/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc will also not apply to lands or buildings owned by or vesting inMMRDA. The exclusion, therefore, is disjunctive because of the word "or". The choice of "or" in theexclusion or ouster provision is clearly intended to widen the scope of the exclusion and not torestrict it only to MMRDA.29.5 The width of the exclusion under the aforesaid provisions is also apparent from the use of word"land" because land itself has a wide meaning. Section 2(d) of the MMRDA Act defines "land" to"includes benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened toanything attached to the earth". It is now well settled that "benefits to arise out of land" also includeFSI39. A structure permanently fastened to the earth is also 'land'. Therefore, the word "land" in theaforesaid provision will have to be understood as per its wider statutory definition and applicabilityof MOFA is excluded not only as to land as also the benefits arising out of land, belonging to orvesting in MMRDA namely, in this case, even FSI. 29.6 Yet another indication as to the width of theexclusion is in the choice of expressions "...or to any land or building belonging to or vesting in theAuthority". It may be useful to refer to the meaning explained to the terms 'vest', 'belong to' orShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/61'belonging' as defined in Black's Law Dictionary relied upon by MMRDA :"vest" as "to give an immediate, fixed right of present or future enjoyment"39 Chedda Housing Development Corporation v Bibijan Shaikh Farid & Ors. - 2007(3) Mh.L.J 402 -Para 15 SSP 108/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc "belong" as "to appertain to; to be the property of.Property "belonging" to a person has two general meanings (1) ownership; ... (2) less thanownership, i.e. less than an unqualified and absolute title, such as the absolute right of user.""belonging" as "that which is connected with a principal or greater thing; an appendage, anappurtenance; also ownership." 29.7 From the aforesaid definitions, it is evident that the words"belonging to" is of wider significance and less technical in its meaning. The significance in thechoice of words is that the word "vesting" has a defined legal connotation but to ensure that theouster of MOFA is not defeated by only using the expression "vesting in the Authority" the provisionalso says "belonging to... the Authority". The conscious exclusion of MOFA not only againstMMRDA but also to the land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA makes it abundantlyclear that the intention of the legislature was to exclude MOFA completely. To read the definition inthe manner suggested by Shri Tamboly for the Appellants would be to ignore the meaning andimport of all the words and phrases used in Clause 2 of Schedule II that excludes the applicability ofMOFA.29.8 From the aforesaid analysis, we are of the view that from a plain meaning of the languagecontained in Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II, application of MOFA to MMRDA Act hasbeen excluded as a whole i.e. not only against MMRDA but also against any land or buildingbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA. Further, as SSP 109/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc land includesFSI, provisions of MOFA cannot be applied while dealing with any dispute in respect of FSI arisingout of the land, which belongs to or vests in the MMRDA.30. According to Shri Tamboly, Learned Advocate appearing for the Appellants, we must apply thepurposive rule of interpretation and not the literal rule of interpretation as the literal rule, if applied,would lead to an absurdity. 30.1 Whereas, according to Shri. Sen and Shri. Jagtiani, Learned SeniorAdvocates appearing for the Developer and MMRDA, respectively, the Court must apply the literalrule of interpretation as the plain meaning of the aforesaid provision is clear and unambiguous andthere is absolutely no reason to depart from it. 30.2 We have carefully considered the submissionsadvanced by all the parties on the rules of interpretation that must be applied while construing thetrue meaning of the aforesaid provisions. Whilst the respective parties including the LearnedAmicus have cited a large number of judgments, many of them for the same or similar propositions,we do not propose to examine each of them. Suffice it to say that there is not much dispute in thepropositions of law laid down in many of those judgments but it is really their applicability toanswering the questions before the Court that is relevant. We have therefore proceeded to considerthose judgments that we thought were of more significance.30.3          The Supreme Court in Ragunath Rai Bareja (supra) has held that theShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/62SSP                                                                                  110/159                                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.docfirst and foremost principle of interpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation is theliteral rule of interpretation. The other rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposiveinterpretation etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or lead tono intelligible results or if read literally would nullify the very object of the statute. Some of therelevant findings of the Court are reproduced hereunder :"38. Learned Counsel for the respondent Bank then submitted that a purposiveinterpretation should be put on Section 31 of the RDB Act so that the bank canrecover its dues. He relied on the decisions of this Court in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v.Ashok Vishnu Kate and Ors., Administrator, Municipal Corporation, Bilaspur v.Dattatraya Dahankar (vide SCC para4), Directorate of Enforcement v. Deepak Mahajan (vide SCC para 31), etc. We areafraid we cannot accept this contention. In fact, in Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank,the argument that a purposive interpretation should be put on the provisions of theRDB Act has been specifically rejected (vide para 34)....39. In Hiralal Ratanlal v. STO, this Court observed :"In construing a statutory provision the first and foremost rule of construction is theliterary construction. All that the Court has to see at the very outset is what does theprovision say. If the provision is unambiguous and if from the provision thelegislative intent is clear, the Court need not call into aid the other rules ofconstruction of statutes. The other rules of construction are called into aid only whenthe legislative intent is not clear."40. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and foremost principle of interpretation ofa statute in every system of interpretation is the literal rule of interpretation. The other rules ofinterpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive interpretation etc. can SSP 111/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or lead to nointelligible results or if read literally would nullify the very object of the statute. Where the words ofa statute are absolutely clear and unambiguous, recourse cannot be had to the principles ofinterpretation other than the literal rule, vide Swedish Match AB v. Securities and Exchange Board,India. As held in Prakash Nath Khanna v. C.I.T., the language employed in a statute is thedeterminative factor of the legislative intent. The legislature is presumed to have made no mistake.The presumption is that it intended to say what it has said.Assuming there is a defect or an omissionin the words used by the legislature, the Court cannot correct or make up the deficiency, especiallywhen a literal reading thereof produces an intelligible result, vide Delhi Financial Corporation v.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/63Rajiv Anand. Where the legislative intent is clear from the language, the Court should give effect toit, vide Government of Andhra Pradesh v. Road Rollers Owners Welfare Association, and the Courtshould not seek to amend the law in the grab of interpretation."(Emphasis supplied) 30.4 The Supreme Court in Alka Chandewar v Shamshul Ishrar Khan40 whileinterpreting the words "any other default" under Section 27(5) of the Arbitration and ConciliationAct 1996 applied the literal rule of interpretation and held that the section was not confined to aperson being guilty of contempt only when failing to attend in accordance with any process andwould apply to "any" contempt of the Arbitral Tribunal during the conduct of arbitral proceedings.The Court held as under :"6. If Section 27(5) is read literally, there is no difficulty in accepting the plea of learned SeniorAdvocate for the appellant, because persons 40 2017 16 SCC 119 - Para 6 SSP 112/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc failing to attend in accordance with the court process fall under a separate category from"any other default". Further, the section is not confined to a person being guilty of contempt onlywhen failing to attend in accordance with such process. The section specifically states that personsguilty of any contempt to the Arbitral Tribunal during the conduct of the Arbitral proceedings iswithin its ken. The aforesaid language is, in fact, in consonance with the Chapter heading of ChapterV, "Conduct of arbitral proceedings". Further, it is well settled that a marginal note can be used asan internal aid to interpretation of statutes only in order to show what is the general drift of thesection. It may also be resorted to when the plain meaning of the section is not clear. In the presentcase we must go by the plain meaning of sub-section (5). This being the case, we find it difficult toappreciate the reasoning of the High Court. Also, in consonance with the modern rule ofinterpretation of statutes, the entire object of providing that a party may approach the ArbitralTribunal instead of the Court for interim reliefs would be stultified if interim orders passed by suchTribunal are toothless. It is to give teeth to such orders that an express provision is made in Section27(5) of the Act."30.5 The Delhi High Court in Mathews J Nedumpara (supra) while interpreting the meaning of theword "court" under Rule 6 of the Bar Council of India Rules, 1975 has explained the plain meaningrule as under :"4. Chapter - II (Standards of Professional Conduct and Etiquette) has beenformulated in the Bar Council of India Rules, 1975 and Rule 6 thereof along with itsexplanation reads as under :"6. An Advocate shall not enter appearance, act, plead or practise in any way before a Court,Tribunal or Authority mentioned in Section 30 of the Act, if the sole or any member thereof isrelated to the Advocate as father, grandfather, son, grand -son, uncle, brother, nephew, first cousin,husband, SSP 113/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece,father-in-law, mother-in-law, son- in-law, brother-in-law, daughter-in-law or sister-in-law. For thepurposes of this rule, Court shall mean a Court, Bench or Tribunal in which above mentionedrelation of the Advocate is a Judge, Member or the Presiding Officer."Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/645. The explanation and the meaning of the word "Court" clearly stipulate that it does not mean theentire Court but only refers to a particular Court where relative of a lawyer is a Presiding Judge.6. According to the petitioner, this explanation indicates the absolute concept of nemo debet essejudex in propria causa and therefore the declaration should be given to bring within the ambit of theword "Court" the entire Court where the relative of a lawyer is a Judge.7. In our considered view, the law does not permit us to do so. The Rule has been formulated by thelegislative authorities and we cannot interpret the Rule based on the concept canvassed before us inthe manner as submitted by the learned petitioner present before us. It is a cardinal principle ofinterpretation of statute that the law is to be interpreted in a manner as laid down in the statutebook in furtherance to the legislative intent and not to interpret or give it a meaning which runscontrary to the legislative intent. If the provisions of Rule 6 and the explanation contained thereto asappearing in the statutory rules are taken note of, it clearly explains the ambit and import of theword "Court" used therein and if the contention of the petitioner is to be accepted, we would be re-writing the statute in a manner which would run contrary to the legislative intent and this, in ourconsidered view, is not permissible in law. That being the legal position, we see no reason to makeany indulgence into the matter.8. Justice G.P. Singh in Principles of Statutory Interpretation 14 Edition revised by Justice A.K.Patnaik in the Chapter "Intention of the Legislature" has clearly laid down the principle by sayingthat a statute is an edict of the legislature and the conventional way of interpreting or SSP 114/159appl 8104 of 2020.doc construing a statute is to seek the intention of its maker. The authorpropounds that a statute is to be construed according to the intent of those who make it and the dutyin judicial review is to act upon the true intention of the legislature. The author further clarifies thatif meanings of a word used or the provisions are plain, effect must be given to it irrespective of theirconsequence. It is stressed by the learned author that when the words of a statute are clear, plain orunambiguous and can have only one meaning, the Courts are bound to give effect to that meaningirrespective of the consequence. It is emphasized by the author that if the words of a statute areclear, precise and unambiguous, then the natural meaning in the ordinary sense have to be given tothe meaning and the provisions of the statute.9. These principles have been reiterated in a judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inthe case of Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank, (2007) 2SCC 230 and for the sake ofconvenience we reproduce hereinunder the principles in detail laid down by the Hon'ble SupremeCourt :"40. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and the foremost principle ofinterpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation is the literal rule of interpretation. Theother rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive interpretation, etc. can only be resortedto when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if read literallywould nullify the very object of the statute. Where the words of a statute are absolutely clear andunambiguous, recourse cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other than the literal rule,vide Swedish Match AB v. Securities and Exchange Board of India (2004) 11 SCC 641]. As held inShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/65Prakash Nath Khanna v. CIT (2004) 9 SCC 686 the language employed in a statute is thedeterminative factor of the legislative intent. The legislature is presumed to have made no mistake.The presumption is that it intended to say what it has said. Assuming there is a defect or anomission in the words used by the legislature, the court cannot correct or make up the deficiency,especially when a literal reading thereof SSP 115/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc produces an intelligibleresult, vide Delhi Financial Corpn. v. Rajiv Anand (2004) 11 SCC 625. Where the legislative intent isclear from the language, the court should give effect to it, vide Govt. of A.P. v. Road Rollers OwnersWelfare Assn. (2004) 6 SCC 210 and the court should not seek to amend the law in the garb ofinterpretation.41. As stated by Justice Frankfurter of the US Supreme Court (see "Of Law & Men: Papers andAddresses of Felix Frankfurter"):"Even within their area of choice the courts are not at large. They are confined by the nature andscope of the judicial function in its particular exercise in the field of interpretation. They are underthe constraints imposed by the judicial function in our democratic society. As a matter of verbalrecognition certainly, no one will gainsay that the function in construing a statute is to ascertain themeaning of words used by the legislature. To go beyond it is to usurp a power which our democracyhas lodged in its elected legislature. The great judges have constantly admonished their brethren ofthe need for discipline in observing the limitations. A judge must not rewrite a statute, neither toenlarge nor to contract it. Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wiselysuggest, construction must eschew interpolation and evisceration. He must not read in by way ofcreation. He must not read out except to avoid patent nonsense or internal contradiction." ...45. As observed by this Court in CIT v. Keshab Chandra Mandal AIR 1950 SC 265 :"Hardship or inconvenience cannot alter the meaning of the language employed by the legislature ifsuch meaning is clear on the face of the statute...."46. The rules of interpretation other than the literal rule would come into play only if there is anydoubt with regard to the express language used or if the plain meaning would lead to an absurdity.Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope for importing any rule of interpretation videPandian Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT (2003) 5 SCC 590.SSP                                                                                             116/159                                                                               appl 8104 of 2020.doc10. Once meaning of the word "Court" used in the rule has been explained by the rule maker in aparticular manner, its explanation in a manner to give it a totally different meaning would beinconsistent to and contrary to the principles of law and the principles governing interpretation ofstatutes."(Emphasis supplied) 30.6 The Supreme Court in B. Premanand (supra) held that when the plainmeaning of words of a statute are clear and unambiguous it is not necessary to depart from theShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/66foremost principle of interpretation i.e., the literal rule of interpretation and there is no scope forimporting any rule of interpretation :"9. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and foremost principle ofinterpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation is the literal rule ofinterpretation. The other rules of interpretation eg. The mischief rule, purposiveinterpretation, etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statue areambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if read literally would nullify the veryobject of the statute. Where the words of a statute are absolutely clear andunambiguous, recourse cannot be had to the principle of interpretation other thanthe literal rule, vide Swedish Match AB v. SEBI [(2004) 11 SCC 641: AIR 2004 SC4219].16. Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope for importing any rule ofinterpretation (vide Pandian Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT [(2003) 5 SCC 590]). It is onlywhere the provisions of a statute are ambiguous that the court can depart from aliteral or strict construction (vide Nasiruddin v. Sita Ram Agarwal [(2003) 2 SCC 577:AIR 2003 SC 1543]). Where the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous effectmust be given to them (vide Bhaiji v. SDO [(2003) 1 SCC 692]).17. No doubt in some exceptional cases departure can be made from SSP 117/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc the literal rule of the interpretation, eg. by adopting a purposive construction, Heydon[Heydon case, (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a: 76 ER 637] mischief rule, etc. but that should only be done invery exceptional cases. Ordinarily, it is not proper for the court to depart from the literal rule as thatwould really be amending the law in the garb of interpretation, which is not permissible... It is forthe legislature to amend the law and not the court (vide State of Jharkhand v. Govind Singh [(2005)10 SCC 43: 2005 SCC (Cri) 1570: JT (2004) 10 SC 349]).18. In Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi [(2003) 1 SCC 730] (SCC p. 733, para 5) this Courtobserved [Ed.: As observed in Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank, (2007) 2 SCC 230, p.245, para 48.]:"48. ... The court cannot legislate under the garb of interpretation."Hence, there should be judicial restraint in this connection, and the temptation to do judiciallegislation should be eschewed by the Courts. In fact, judicial legislation is an oxymoron.19. In Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers [(2003) 6 SCC 659: AIR 2003 SC2434] this Court observed: (SCC p. 669, para 19) "19. It is a well-settled principle in law that thecourt cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. A statute isan edict of the legislature. The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor oflegislative intent."...Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/6722. The function of the court is only to expound the law and not to legislate (vide District MiningOfficer v. TISCO [(2001) 7 SCC 358]). If we accept the interpretation canvassed by the learnedcounsel for the private respondents, we will really be legislating because in the guise ofinterpretation we will be really amending Rule 27(c) of the Rules.24. The literal rule of interpretation really means that there should be no interpretation. In otherwords, we should read the statute SSP 118/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc as it is, without distorting ortwisting its language. We may mention here that the literal rule of interpretation is not only followedby Judges and lawyers, but it is also followed by the layman in his ordinary life. To give anillustration, if a person says "this is a pencil", then he means that it is a pencil; and it is not thatwhen he says that the object is a pencil, he means that it is a horse, donkey or an elephant. In otherwords, the literal rule of interpretation simply means that we mean what we say and we say what wemean. If we do not follow the literal rule of interpretation, social life will become impossible, and wewill not understand each other. If we say that a certain object is a book, then we mean it is a book. Ifwe say it is a book, but we mean it is a horse, table or an elephant, then we will not be able tocommunicate with each other. Life will become impossible. Hence, the meaning of the literal rule ofinterpretation is simply that we mean what we say and we say what we mean." (Emphasis Supplied)30.7 This Court in Bharat Bhogilal Patel (supra) applying the literal rule of interpretation held that"...if the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts toadopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more inconsistentwith the alleged object and policy of the subject Act."30.8 All of these judgments and many others reiterate the principle that when the words in a statuteare clear, then effect must be given to them on the basis of their plain meaning. This meaning is thebest and safest indication of the intention of the legislature. The other rules of interpretation such asthe mischief rule, purposive SSP 119/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc interpretation upon which theAppellants in particular have relied upon are usually resorted to when the plain words of a statuteare ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if read literally would nullify the very object of thestatute. The resulting interpretation of Section 31 read with Clause 2 of Schedule II on the basis ofthe plain meaning of the words used would be the same even if we ascertained the meaning of thewords used by looking to the relevant context and not just by looking to the text of the provisionsthat we have interpreted.30.9 As noted above, we are of the considered view that from the plain meaning of Section 31 readwith Schedule II, Clause II it is clear that the legislature intended to exclude the applicability ofMOFA, as a whole.Purposive interpretation of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause of MMRDA Act would yield thesame result as literal interpretation:31. Since extensive arguments have been made by all the parties we shall consider the applicabilityof the said rule of purposive interpretation. 31.1 The rule of purposive interpretation states thatwhen the material words are capable of two interpretations, the courts must adopt thatinterpretation which "shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy". This rule which is alsoShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/68known as the mischief rule was first laid down in Heydon's case41.41   76 ER 637SSP                                                                               120/159                                                                            appl 8104 of 2020.doc31.2            As stated in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v Nusli Neville Wadia42, "...to interpret a statute in a reasonable manner the court must place itself in the chair of a reasonablelegislator/author. So done the rules of purposive construction have to be resorted to which wouldrequire the construction of the Act in such a manner as to see that the object of the Act is fulfilled."31.3 As noted above, the object of the MMRDA Act is inter alia to establish an authority which wouldprovide for planning, coordinating and supervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of theareas in that region and of executing plans, projects and schemes for such development. The objectof the MMRDA, so set up, is to secure the development of the Metropolitan Region. MMRDA infurtherance of this object supervises projects and even takes part in its execution. It acquires, holdsand disposes (by lease) land (which includes benefits arising out of land) for the purposes ofcarrying out the development.31.4 In order to achieve the aforesaid objective, the legislature has consciously excluded various actsother than MOFA or provided for the manner in which they will be applied. This has been done witha view to ensure that the provisions of the MMRDA Act are implemented effectively and without theimpediments that may otherwise occur if the activity of MMRDA or on MMRDA lands and buildingsis governed by different legislations. It is relevant to mention here 42 2008 3 SCC 279 SSP 121/159appl 8104 of 2020.doc that there are as many as 11 non-obstante clauses in the MMRDA Act. 31.5Considering the aforesaid object, if MOFA is applied, it would create impediments in theimplementation of the scheme of the MMRDA Act. For example, if Section 7 and 7A of MOFA areapplied to MMRDA or to land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA, the consent of the flatpurchasers would be required before utilizing additional FSI, which FSI does not even belong tothem. If Section 7 is applied, the consent of the flat purchasers would be required before amendingplans, etc. Such application would clearly restrict or affect MMRDA's right / power to directamendment of development plans, which power exclusively vests with MMRDA under the MMRDAAct, as also under the said Lease deed. So also, if Section 11 of MOFA is applied to MMRDA lands itmay require the lessee who is developing upon MMRDA lands to convey or assign its leaseholdinterest on the entire plot thus compelling MMRDA to accept the society as being the lessee or sub-lessee. This in turn is contrary to the right that MMDRA as a statutory authority and land ownerwould have to ensure that there is no assignment of the lease or the sub- lease except with itsconsent. MMRDA may have different reasons for not wanting a society of flat purchasers as a lesseeof the land such as to ensure that the lessee is an entity that has the experience or financial means todevelop any unexploited FSI on payment of premiums, which would be revenue for MMRDA toShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/69further its activities; to ensure that reservations are duly developed amongst others.SSP                                                                               122/159                                                                     appl 8104 of 2020.doc31.6         These are just some examples that would explain why MOFA has notbeen made applicable to MMRDA or to any land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA.This is keeping in mind the objects sought to be achieved and the purpose intended to be served bythe Act and to advance the cause for which the enactment is brought into force.31.7 It is not open for the Court to scrutinise the provisions of MOFA and analyse which of thoseprovisions, when applied to a building constructed on MMDRA land, would or would not affect orimpact upon the activities carried out by MMRDA. It may be that in some cases the provisions ofMOFA if applied between a developer and flat purchasers may not have any significant impact onthe activities and objects of the MMRDA Act. That, however, is a decision for the legislature to takeand for the courts to implement. Such types of decisions taken by the legislature are essentiallypolicy decisions that have expression in legislations. In the field of urban planning and developmentthese decisions are often arrived at by a process of trial and error. It is as part of that process thatthe legislature has after having enacted MOFA chosen to exclude its applicability only in a limitedclass of cases in relation to statutory authorities like MHADA and MMRDA as explained above. Wehave therefore chosen not to undertake that exercise of looking at specific provisions of MOFA to seeif they can be applied as between the developer and the flat purchasers as in our view that would becontrary to the literal and purposive interpretation of SSP 123/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Clause IIof Schedule II read with Section 31 of the MMRDA Act. 31.8 Therefore, in our considered view evenif the purposive rule of interpretation is applied, it still leads to the same result that MOFA wouldnot be applicable to MMRDA or land or building belonging to or vesting in MMRDA and thus hasbeen excluded as a whole.31.9 In any event, in our view any departure by us from the aforesaid interpretation would end inre-writing the said provision, which exercise is not permissible in law as the said power only lieswith the legislature. Judgments of the Supreme Court have time and again struck a note of cautionthat courts must not legislate under the garb of interpretation. Courts must exercise judicialrestraint in interpretation of statutes and the temptation to undertake an exercise of judiciallegislation should be eschewed by the courts.31.10 In State of U.P. v. Hindustan Aluminium Corpn. (supra) wherein the Supreme Court held asunder :"66. It has to be appreciated that the power to legislate is both positive in the sense ofmaking a law, and negative in the sense of repealing a law or making it inoperative.In either case, it is a power of the Legislature, and should lie where it belongs. Anyother view will be hazardous and may well be said to be an encroachment on thelegislative field. In an extreme and a clear case, no doubt, an antiquated law may beShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/70said to have become obsolete- the more so if it is a penal law and has becomeincapable of user buy a drastic change in the circumstances. But the judge of thechange should be the Legislature, and courts are not expected to undertake that dutyunless SSP 124/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc that becomes unavoidable and thecircumstances are so apparent as to lead to one and only one conclusion. This isequally so in regard to the delegated or subordinate legislation."31.11 We are also supported by the decision in Janhit Manch (supra) where the Apex Court whileconsidering a challenge to the Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay, 1991 has heldthat policies formulated and legislations made cannot be interfered with, unless they fall foul of theConstitution of India. The Court held as under :"13. We have to keep in mind the principles of separation of powers. The electedgovernment of the day, which has the mandate of the people, is to take care of policymatters. There is a democratic structure of different levels, starting from the level ofVillage Panchayats, Nagar Palika, Municipal Authorities, Legislative Assemblies andthe elected Parliament each of them has a role to perform. In aspects, as presented inthe instant case, a consultative process is always helpful and is one which has alreadybeen undertaken. The philosophy of Appellant 2 cannot be transmitted as amandatory policy of the Government which is what would happen were a mandamusto be issued on the prayers made. Perspective of individuals may vary, but if theelected bodies which have policy formulation powers, is to be superseded by theideals of each individual, the situation would be chaotic. The policies formulated andlegislations made, unless they fall foul of the Constitution of India cannot beinterfered with, at the behest of the Appellants. The Appellants have completelymissed this point."31.12 Even in Shri Ram Saha (supra) while applying the rule of purposive SSP 125/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc construction, the Supreme Court has held that a word of caution is necessary that the textof the statute is not to be sacrificed and the court cannot rewrite the statute. The relevant findings ofthe Court are as under :"19. It is well-settled principle of interpretation that a statute is to be interpreted onits plain reading; in the absence of any doubt or difficulty arising out of such readingof a statute defeating or frustrating the object and purpose of an enactment, it mustbe read and understood by its plain reading. However, in case of any difficulty ordoubt arising in interpreting a provision of an enactment, courts will interpret such aprovision keeping in mind the objects sought to be achieved and the purposeintended to be served by such a provision so as to advance the cause for which theenactment is brought into force. If two interpretations are possible, the one whichpromotes or favors the object of the Act and purpose it serves, is to be preferred. Atany rate, in the guise of purposive interpretation, the courts cannot re-write a statute.A purposive interpretation may permit a reading of the provision consistent with thepurpose and object of the Act but the courts cannot legislate and enact the provisionShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/71either creating or taking away substantial rights by stretching or straining a piece oflegislation."(Emphasis supplied) Literal Interpretation of Section 31 read with Schedule II,Clause II does not lead to 'absurdity':32. Shri. Tamboly, Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Appellants has canvassed that theapplicability of literal rule of interpretation of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II would leadto 'absurdity'. His submissions in this regard have already been noted above.SSP                                                                                             126/159                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.doc32.1          He has submitted that if the protective provisions contemplated inMOFA qua a developer are excluded the same will lead to various absurdities like (i) the purchaserswill not be able to seek disclosure of the plans and specifications of the building built or to be builtor seek plans and specifications approved by the local authority from the developer (ii) thepurchasers will not be able to compel the developer to enter into a registered agreement, even if thepurchasers have advanced more than 20 per cent of the sale price, (iii) the purchasers will not beable to compel the formation of a Society, even once the minimum number of persons required toform a co-operative society are available, etc. Thus, Shri Tamboly has submitted that if the literalinterpretation leads to an 'absurdity', the court must depart from it and a construction may be putwhich modifies the meaning of the words. According to him the Court must read the provision toread as to mean that MOFA is not applicable to MMRDA but is applicable inter se between theDeveloper and the flat purchasers. 32.2 In response, Shri. Jagtiani appearing on behalf of MMRDAhas submitted that the argument of the Appellants that if literal rule of interpretation is applied toSection 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II, it would lead to absurdity is a complete misconception ofwhat constitutes an 'absurdity'. According to Shri Jagtiani, the argument of 'absurdity', allegedlybrought about by Section 31 read with Schedule II, could only be made by the Appellants if a plainmeaning of those provisions was inherently inconsistent with the provisions of the same act i.e. theMMRDA Act.SSP                                                                              127/159                                                                        appl 8104 of 2020.docHowever that is not even the submission of the Appellant. 32.3 Shri. Sen, appearing for theDeveloper and Shri. Jagtiani have also submitted that the protections given to the flat purchasersunder MOFA can still be enforced by the flat purchasers by adopting the common law remedies andper se there is no vacuum created by the complete exclusion of MOFA by MMRDA Act. 32.4 We arein agreement with Shri Jagtiani and Shri Sen. An 'absurdity' resulting from a particularinterpretation so as to lead to rejecting that interpretation must occur within the provisions of an actitself. That argument would be available to a party if the provisions of a statute are interpreted in aparticular manner, literally or otherwise, such that it creates an irreconcilable contradiction withinShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/72the Act or defeats the scheme and purpose of that Act itself.32.5 In the present case, the plain meaning of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II does notcreate any irreconcilable contradiction within the MMRDA Act or defeats the scheme and purpose ofthat Act itself. Infact, it seeks to further the object of the MMRDA Act. There is no merit in theargument that an absurdity in the interpretation of the MMRDA Act results by it negating thebeneficial provisions of MOFA when that is exactly the clear and stated intendment of the MMRDAAct so as to ensure that the objects and purposes of the MMRDA Act are achieved. 32.6 As rightlypointed out by Shri. Sen and Shri. Jagtiani, MOFA is not the sole repository of flat purchasers'rights. These rights exist in various forms under SSP 128/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc differentlegislations, such as the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the Contract Act, 1872, the ConsumerProtection Act, 1986 (now Consumer Protection Act, 2019), Specific Relief Act, 1963 to name a few.Thus, even if the application of MOFA is excluded, there would evidently not be a vacuum in the lawand the flat purchasers can exercise their other common law and statutory remedies available.Infact, before the enactment of RERA some states in India had not even enacted a legislation akin toMOFA, and flat purchaser rights in such states are governed by the aforesaid legislations. If the flatpurchasers are aggrieved that their contracts were negotiated and concluded based on false ormistaken representations or that there was a need to enforce those contract or claim damages forbreach, the said statutes provide for clear remedies in this regard.32.7 In any event, no class of citizens (in this case flat purchasers) have a vested right in thecontinued application of statutory protection if the legislature deems it unfit to apply that statute ina given situation. This is not a vires challenge to the exclusion of MOFA by the MMDRA Act andtherefore the question before the Court is not whether such flat purchasers are at a disadvantage ascompared to others to whom MOFA is available without there being any intelligible differentia. 32.8The second submission of the Shri Tamboly on 'absurdity' is that an irreconcilable and absurdsituation is caused due to exclusion of MOFA, especially after RERA Act. It has been submitted thatif MOFA is excluded wholly by MMRDA SSP 129/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Act, it will lead to anabsurd situation where all similar protections available under MOFA would be available to the flatpurchasers of the Additional Building (which is registered under RERA) but would not be availableto the flat purchasers of the said Building which is situated on the same Suit Plot.32.9 We have given our careful consideration to the aforesaid submission canvassed by theAppellants. Although the said submission appeared to be appealing in equity, however, we are afraidthat the same cannot be accepted in law especially considering the fact that the Appellants have notchallenged the vires of the MMRDA Act in this regard, as noted above.32.10 RERA is a central legislation whereas MOFA and MMRDA Act are state legislations. Thelegislature has the plenary power and prerogative to legislate within its legislative competence.Every legislation (particularly in economic matters) is essentially empiric and based onexperimentation or what one may call trial and error method. It cannot provide for all possiblesituations or anticipate all possible effects of how such legislation operates qua persons and / orproperty prior to the legislation being introduced or amended. The legislature in some instancesdraws a line in the sand to determine when and in what circumstances a legislation will have orShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/73cease to have effect. That is precisely what has been done with RERA inasmuch as its applicability isrestricted to those real estate projects that have obtained a completion certificate after a particulardate. There is no dispute that the building in which the SSP 130/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docAppellants have their flats has obtained an Occupation Certificate in 2014 much before theenactment of RERA.32.11 Even if an anomalous situation arises where the plot required to be conveyed under RERA isconveyed to the society of flat purchasers to the exclusion of the Appellants, that in itself is not aground for departing from the plain meaning of the MMRDA Act which contains a blanket exclusionof MOFA as against land or buildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA. We do not see an anomalyin such a situation especially as the Appellants have received what they had contracted for under thelegal provisions that govern their development. 32.12 It is not the Appellants case that in the facts ofthis matter, there have been unauthorized amendments in plans or that the construction is carriedout in contravention of amended plans. It is also not their case that the developer refused to executea registered agreement for the flat purchased by them. Insofar as formation of society is concerned,there is no prohibition in law for a society of flat purchasers to be formed with respect to a buildingconstructed on MMRDA owned land. However, the formation of a society at the behest of thepromoter under MOFA is not the correct approach which has to be adopted for registration of asociety. A proposed society may, with the permission of MMRDA, form a society under the MCS Act.As pointed out by MMRDA, this appears to have been done in respect of another society (FountainSquare CHSL) such that the cooperative society is of flat purchasers of a SSP 131/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc building without making any claim to assignment of lease of the land by applying theprovisions of MOFA. However, the Appellants insistence that the owner / Respondent No.1 is dutybound to form this society and convey its title to the society of flat purchasers as per MOFA ismisconceived and unsustainable given that MOFA is not applicable to such lands.32.13 In rejecting the Appellants submissions based on 'absurdity' or anomalies, we are supportedby our aforesaid view by the following judgments relied upon by MMRDA.32.14 The Supreme Court in Raghunath Rai Bareja (supra)43 has held that when there is a conflictbetween the law and equity, it is the law that has to prevail. The relevant finding is reproducedhereunder for ready reference :"Learned counsel for the respondent Bank submitted that it will be very unfair if theappellant who is a guarantor of the loan and Director of the Company which took theloan, avoids paying the debt. While we fully agree with the learned counsel thatequity is wholly in favour of the respondent Bank, since obviously a bank should beallowed to recover its debts, we must, however, state that it is well settled that whenthere is conflict between law and equity, it is the law which has to prevail, inaccordance with the Latin maxim "dura lex sed lex", which means "the law is hard,but it is the law". Equity can only supplement the law, but it cannot supplant oroverride it."

In order to strike a balance between the interests of the landlords and also thetenants and for giving a boost to house building activity, the Legislature in its wisdomhas decided to restrict the protection of the Rent Act only to those premises for whichrent is payable upto the sum of Rs. 3,500/- per month and has decided not to extendthis statutory protection to the premises constructed on or after the date of cominginto operation of the Amending Act for a period of ten years. This is a matter oflegislative policy. The Legislature could have repealed the Rent Act altogether. It canalso repeal it step by step. It has decided to confine the statutory protection to theexisting tenancies whose monthly rent did not exceed Rs. 3,500/-.29. In our view, it is for the Legislature to decide what should be the cut- off point forthe purpose of classification and the Legislature of necessity must have a lot oflatitude in this regard. It is well settled that the safeguard provided by Article 14 ofthe Constitution can only be invoked, if the classification is made on the groundswhich are totally irrelevant to the object of the statute. But, if there is some nexusbetween the objects sought to be achieved and the classification, the Legislature ispresumed to have acted in proper exercise of its constitutional power. Theclassification in practice may result in some hardship. But, a statutory discriminationcannot be set aside, if there are facts on the basis of which this statutorydiscrimination can be justified....40. So far the ceiling limit of Rs. 3,500/- is concerned, it is well settled that aprovision initially valid can in the long run turn out to have become discriminatory.An exemption with the passage of time may not have any nexus with the objectssought to be achieved by the statute. But, as of now, 44 1995 1 SCC 104 SSP 133/159appl 8104 of 2020.doc it cannot be said that the persons, who are paying more thanRs. 42,000/- per year as rent, belong to the weaker section of the community. It is forthe Legislature to decide which particular section of people require protection of anygiven point of time. This is a matter of legislative policy/The argument that unless anescalating figure of ceiling limit of rent is fixed the classification will becomemeaningless, pre-supposes that there will be continuous high price rise in future. Italso pre-supposes that in such a situation the Legislature will not take any correctivestep.41. In the case of Motor General Traders v State of Andhra Pradesh, Section 32(b) ofthe Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 was heldinvalid by this Court, because it was per se discriminatory. It was pointed out thatthere were some justification for exempting new buildings which were 5, 7 or 10 yearsold when the Act came into force, in order to provide incentive to builders to buildbuildings. But there could not be any justification for continuing with this exemptionindefinitely. A long period had elapsed after passing of the Act and this was a crucialfactor in deciding the question whether the impugned law had become discriminatoryShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/75or not. This case was decided on October 26, 1983. It was pointed out that theexemption had continued to remain in force for more than 25 years.45. It was observed in that judgment that "the Legislature in its wisdom is presumedto understand and appreciate correctly the problems of the State and the needs of thepeople made manifest by experience.... legislative innovation by social and economicexperimentation must be permitted to continue without judicial interference." It wasultimately held :"The legislative object is, therefore, to protect tenants who are economically weakerin comparison to those affluent tenants falling outside the specified limit of income,and at the same time to encourage construction of new buildings which will result inbetter availability of accommodation, employment opportunity and economicprosperity. This is reasonable classification which does not suffer from the vice ofbeing too vague or broad.SSP                                                                                     134/159                                                                            appl 8104 of 2020.docClassification based on income is well known to law. Such classification has areasonable relation to the twin legislative objects mentioned above. We see nothingunreasonable or irrational or unworkable or vague or unfair or unjust in theclassification adopted by the impugned provision." ...48. However, we need not go too deeply into this aspect of the controversy, as in ouropinion, it is for the Legislature to decide whether or not any section of the peopleshould be protected in any way by law. For this purpose, the Legislature can identifythe section of the people who needs protection and decide how the classification willbe done or what will be the cut-off point for the purpose of making suchclassification. The classification may be done on income basis or rental basis or someother basis. The Court can only consider whether the classification has been done onan understandable basis having regard to the object of the statute. The Court will notquestion its validity on the ground of lake of legislative wisdom.49. Moreover, the classification cannot be done with mathematical precision. TheLegislature must have considerable latitude for making the classification havingregard to the surrounding circumstances and facts. The Court cannot act as asuper-legislature and decide whether cut-off point for the classification on the basisof monthly rent should be Rs. 3,500/- or Rs. 4,000/- or Rs. 5,000/-. If theclassification is totally irrational and has no nexus with the object sought to beachieved by the statute, then only will the Court strike down such classification....Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/7651. The next point relates to interpretation of Section 3(c) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. It was urgedthat the Delhi Rent Control (Amendment) Act came into force on 1.12.1988. The effect of Section3(c) which was introduced by the Amendment Act was to remove those premises whose monthlyrent exceeded Rs. 3,500/- from the ambit of the Delhi Rent Control Act. This amendment of theRent Control Act would not apply to those tenancies which SSP 135/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc werecreated prior to 1.12.1988. It was argued that the Amendment Act has not been specifically maderetrospective. Therefore, it could not affect the rights acquired by the tenants under the RentControl Act before its amendment in 1988. Under the existing law, the tenants had acquiredvaluable property rights. The landlord could neither evict the tenant nor enhance the rent at will. Asuit could not be brought against a tenant on the ground of expiry of the lease, whether a lease wasfor a fixed term, year to year or month to month, on the ground of expiration of period of lease.Filing of such suit was barred by virtue of Section 14 of the Rent Act. Some of the tenants who couldafford to build did not build houses of their own because of the protection provided by theprovisions of the Rent Act. Had these provisions not been there, these tenants or lessees might havebuilt houses of their own or purchased properties elsewhere. These vested rights could not bedisturbed unless the Amendment Act contained specific provisions to that effect.52. We are unable to uphold this contention for a number of reasons. Prior to the enactment of theRent Control Act by the various State Legislatures, the legal relationship between the landlord andtenant was governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. Delhi Rent Control Actprovided protection to the tenants from drastic enhancement of rent by the landlord as well aseviction, except on certain specific grounds. The Legislature by the Amendment Act No. 57 of 1988has partially repealed the Delhi Rent Control Act. This is a case of express repeal. By Amending Actthe Legislature has withdrawn the protection hitherto enjoyed by the tenants who were paying Rs.3,500/- or above as monthly rent. If the tenants were sought to be evicted prior to the amendmentof the Act, they could have taken advantage of the provisions of the Act to resist such eviction by thelandlord. But this was nothing more than a right to take advantage of the enactment The tenantenjoyed statutory protection as long as the statute remained in force and was applicable to him. Ifthe statute ceases to be operative, the tenant cannot claim to continue to have the old statutoryprotection. It was observed by SSP 136/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Tindal, C.J., in the case of Kay v.Goodwin (1830) 6 Bing. 576, 582 :"The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as completely from the records of the Parliamentas if it had never been passed; and it must be considered as a law that never existed except for thepurpose of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was anexisting law."53. The provisions of a repealed statute cannot be relied upon after it has been repealed. But, whathas been acquired under the Repealed Act cannot be disturbed. But, if any new or further step isneeded to be taken under the Act, that cannot be taken even after the Act is repealed.(Emphasis Supplied) 31.16 In Martin Burn Ltd. (supra)45, the Supreme Court held that :Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/77"14. We can now deal with the reasoning on which the High Court in the present casejustified its order of remand. It realised that by making the order it was depriving theappellant of one of its chances to object to the valuation, namely, the chance underSection 139, but it felt that by upholding that right of the appellant it would bedepriving the Corporation of its rates wholly as the time-limit prescribed by Section131(2)(b) had expired. It thought that it was faced with two evils and that it would bechoosing the lesser of the two if it allowed the Corporation a chance to collect itsrates. With great respect, we find this line of reasoning altogether unsupportable. Aresult flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A court has no power toignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from itsoperation. A statute must of course be given effect to whether a court likes the resultor not. When the High Court found that Section 131(2)(b) had been attracted to thecase, it had no power to set that provision at nought."(Emphasis Supplied) 45 1966 1 SCR 543 SSP 137/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc 32.17The Supreme Court in Basawaraj (supra)46 held that :"12. It is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly affect aparticular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute soprescribes. The Court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitablegrounds. "A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A Court has nopower to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from itsoperation." The statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to aparticular party but the Court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to thesame. The legal maxim "dura lex sed lex" which means "the law is hard but it is thelaw", stands attracted in such a situation. It has consistently been held that,"inconvenience is not" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute."(Emphasis Supplied) 32.18 The judgment in the case of Vasant Ganpat Padave(supra), relied upon by the Appellant, is of no assistance to the Appellants as theCourt in that case has held that a particular reading of the provisions of that Actmakes that Act itself unworkable. The argument of absurdity can have no applicationwhen the provisions including the protection of an Act such as MOFA is madeinapplicable by a subsequent legislation i.e. MMRDA Act.32.19 Thus, we conclude by saying that as the legal maxim "dura lex sed lex" states - The law is hard,but it is the law.32.20 Accordingly, the second submission of the Appellants on 'absurdity' is rejected.46    2013 14 SCC 81SSP                                                                                           138/159                                                                             appl 8104 of 2020.docShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/7832.21           The Appellants then contended that the expression "or" in Schedule II,Clause II must be read as "and" in order to avoid the 'absurdity' in the said provision. According tothe Appellants the exclusion of MOFA is attracted only when both the land and building belong to orvest in MMRDA, which is consistent with (i) the heading to Chapter VII, (ii) the marginal note toSection 31 and (iii) Section 31 itself. In support of this submission, the Appellants have relied uponthe judgment in Fakir Mohd. (supra) which states that it is permissible to read "or" as "and" andvice-versa if some other part of the same statute or the legislative intent clearly spells out such arequirement.32.22 As rightly pointed out on behalf of MMRDA, that the normal rule is that "and" must be read asconjunctive and "or" must be read as disjunctive. There must be compelling reasons to read "or" as"and" as explained above and vice versa. "Or" is a conscious choice. In the present case, we hold thatthe Appellants have failed to make out such a compelling case as required to read "or" as "and".32.23 We are supported in our aforesaid view by the judgment of the Supreme Court in ManmohanDas Shah v Bishun Das 47, where while refusing to read "or" as "and", the Court held as under :"The ordinary rule of construction is that a provision of a Statute must be construed in accordancewith the language used therein unless there 47 AIR 1967 SCC 643 SSP 139/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc are compelling reasons. Such as, where a literal construction would reduce the provisionto absurdity or prevent the manifest intention of the legislature from being carried out. There is noreason why the word "or" should be construed otherwise than in its ordinary meaning. If theconstruction suggested by Mr. Desai were to be accepted and the word "or" were to be construed asmeaning "and", it would mean that the construction should not only be such as materially alters theaccommodation but is also such that it would substantially diminish its value. ..........." (EmphasisSupplied) 32.24 The Appellants had relied upon the judgments in CWS (India) Ltd. (supra), State ofMP V/s. Azad Bharat Finance (supra), Baburao Shantaram More (supra), Dwarkadas Marfatia(supra), H. S. Vankani (supra) which state that if the literal construction of a provision leads to anabsurdity, the court must apply rule of purposive interpretation to cure such absurdity or mischief.However, since we have already held that the literal construction of the provision does not lead to anabsurdity or cause any hardship, these judgments relied upon by the Appellants have no application.32.25 For the reasons aforesaid, we reject the third submission of the Appellants made on theground of 'absurdity'.33. In addition to the submission on absurdity, Shri. Tamboly also relied upon certain averments inthe letter dated 6 September 2017 addressed by MMRDA to the flat purchasers and in the Affidavitin Reply dated 26 November 2018 to the SSP 140/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Notice of Motionwherein MMRDA has stated that MOFA can apply to the Developer upon taking permission ofMMRDA. He relies on this, to show that MOFA can be applied between the Developer and flatpurchasers inter se and that there is no complete exclusion. He seeks to rely on the said statementsas an aid to interpretation. 33.1 Shri. Jagtiani has stated that the aforesaid stand had been taken byMMRDA on an incorrect understanding of the law. However, such a statement even if made cannotoperate as an estoppel against the application of a primary legislation. 33.2 The question whether aShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/79statement by an authority can operate as an estoppel against the application of primary legislationor not, is no longer res integra. 33.3 A Division Bench of this Court in Supriya Rajesh Nair (supra),of which one of us (S J Kathawalla J.) was a member, while considering whether a letter addressedby the UDD, Government of Maharashtra to the Additional Government Pleader could have anybearing on the interpretation and application to a GR held that "a correspondence between the UDDand its advocate cannot be read as an aid to interpretation of a Government Resolution, especiallywhen its plain meaning is clear." 33.4 Further, in Bank of Baroda (supra), this Court held that :"11. The learned Counsel for the respondent No.1 contended that the doctrine ofpromissory estoppel cannot be invoked to compel the public bodies or theGovernment to carry out a promise which is contrary to law and he is supported byShabi Construction Company v City & Industrial Developmemt Corporation andanother (1995) 4 SCC 301 as well as Pune Municipal Corporation and another vs.Promoters and Builders SSP 141/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Association andanother... The Learned Counsel for the petitioners fairly conceded to this legalposition." (Emphasis Supplied) 33.5 In view of the aforesaid, we hold that thestatements by MMRDA in the aforesaid letter and Affidavit in Reply to Notice ofMotion cannot be used as an estoppel against MMRDA to argue that MOFA can beapplied between the Developer and flat purchasers inter se.Partial application of MOFA as between the Developer and flat purchasers that does not prejudiceMMRDA is not the correct approach:34. Shri Rohaan Cama, the Learned Amicus Curiae, has stated that the plain meaning of Section 31,Schedule II, Clause II indicates that MOFA is not applicable to MMRDA or to any land belonging toor vesting in MMRDA, and as such any provisions that prejudices the rights of MMRDA againstthese lands are specifically excluded. However, it is the Amicus's submission that there are variousprovisions of MOFA, more particularly, Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13 which would have not theslightest impact on the land or the rights of MMRDA therein and are purely governing inter serelations between the flat purchasers and the developers, can be applied. According to him there isno reason why this must not be applied. 34.1 This submission of the Learned Amicus Curiae, isbased on the distinction to be drawn between the definitions of 'land' and 'development' under theMMRDA Act. His submissions in this regard have been noted above.SSP                                                                                  142/159                                                                        appl 8104 of 2020.doc34.2          According to the Learned Amicus Curiae, the object of the MMRDAAct is not to allow a developer to default or renege on his obligations to a flat purchaser which hasnothing to do with MMRDA whatsoever. There is no conceivable reason as to why those provisionsof MOFA which do not relate to MMRDA and which in no manner affect or prejudice MMRDA andwhich only relate to the rights in the flat / development, and not in the land itself, should not apply.This is to say that the exclusion of MOFA is only qua MMRDA lands and not qua flats constructedShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/80thereon with which MMRDA has no connection or interest.34.3 It was submitted that if this interpretation is adopted, it will sub-serve the interest of MMRDAwithout depriving Flat Purchasers of statutory rights under MOFA, which have nothing to do withMMRDA's land, buildings or rights therein. The aforesaid interpretation given above attempts tostrike a balance between the various competing interests of MMRDA and the flat purchasers, whilehaving regard to the object and subject of the two legislations i.e. MOFA and the MMRDA Act. 34.4We have given our careful consideration to the aforesaid submissions made by the Learned AmicusCuriae and the rival submission of Shri. Sen and Shri. Jagtiani. Although, we appreciate thebalanced approach being sought to be given by the Learned Amicus Curiae, we are afraid that wecannot accept the same. In addition to our reasons and findings on the correct interpretation of therelevant provisions as noted above, which would not allow for this approach, set out below arefurther SSP 143/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc reasons for not accepting this approach.34.5 A plain reading of Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II of the MMRDA Act shows that theexclusion of MOFA as against MMRDA or to any land or building belonging to or vesting inMMRDA is absolute. Therefore, if the land or building in question belongs to or vests in MMRDA,the application of MOFA stands excluded as a whole.34.6 Section 31 of the MMRDA Act provides that "the enactments mentioned under Schedule IIshall apply, with or without modifications, or shall not apply to the Authority or shall be amended tothe extent and in the manner mentioned in the Schedule".34.7 Thus, Section 31 seeks to either modify or restrict or exclude the application of certainlegislations to the MMRDA Act. 34.8 Clause II of Schedule II to the MMRDA Act which reads as"The said Act [MOFA] shall not apply..." clearly shows that application of MOFA has been excludedwithout any reservation or qualification.34.9 This is in contrast with the Bombay Government Premises (Eviction) Act, 1955, the provisionsof which are modified in their application to MMRDA as mentioned in Schedule II to the MMRDAAct.34.10 Thus to read down Section 31 and Schedule II to the MMRDA Act, as suggested by theLearned Amicus Curiae, to mean that only 'some' provisions of SSP 144/159 appl 8104 of 2020.docMOFA shall not apply to MMRDA or to lands or buildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDAwhereas other provisions of MOFA would apply, is contrary to the plain meaning of Section 31 readwith Clause II of Schedule II of the MMRDA Act. 34.11 If the intention of the legislature was to makecertain provisions of MOFA applicable to land or buildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA or toflats constructed in such buildings, the legislature could very well have modified the provisions ofMOFA in its application to MMRDA lands as is done for the Bombay Government Premises(Eviction) Act, 1955 rather than exclude it entirely. That the legislature has not done so is animportant indicator of the legislative intent of making the exclusion of MOFA absolute.Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/8134.12 Thus, if we accept the submission of the Learned Amicus Curiae, we would be stepping intothe shoes of the legislature and carrying out an exercise which the legislature itself never intended todo. This is a conscious legislative choice and cannot be interfered with by the courts.34.13 Further, the submission of the Learned Amicus Curiae that the exclusion of MOFA is only withrespect to lands or buildings belonging to or vesting in MMRDA and that MOFA will continue toapply to 'development' (as defined in MMRDA Act) or 'flats' (as defined in MOFA) owned by flatpurchasers, cannot be accepted for the following reasons.34.14         The intendment of the exclusion of MOFA by MMRDA Act is widerSSP                                                                              145/159                                                                               appl 8104 of 2020.docthan what is suggested by the Learned Amicus Curiae. The intendment is not limited to preventingprejudice to MMRDA but extends to advance the object of the MMRDA Act read as a whole i.e. tosecure the development of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The exclusion qua land or buildingbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA is intended to aid the expedited development of such landswithin a notified area for which MMRDA is not only the landowner, but also, in many cases, thePlanning Authority.34.15 The definition of 'development' draws colour from Section 12 of the MMRDA Act whichprovides at sub-section (1) that the :'The main object of the Authority shall be to secure the development of the MumbaiMetropolitan Region according to the Regional Plan, and for that purpose thefunctions of the Authority shall be- ...' 34.16 The definition of 'development' inSection 2(c) together with Section 12 of the Act form an important part of the purposeto be fulfilled by the MMRDA Act.The development (such as the ODC or BKC etc.) is contemplated to achieve socio- economicimprovement in housing, urban infrastructure and amenities within the MMR. The exclusion ofMOFA is a conscious policy decision by the legislature to aid the realization of this object of theMMRDA Act and not merely to avoid any inconvenience or hardship to MMRDA. This is perhapsbest articulated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons (set out in detail in the earlier WrittenSubmissions SSP 146/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc filed by MMRDA) which acknowledges that it is :'... absolutely essential to ensure that the implementation of the various proposals [inthe approved regional plans] is done in a co-ordinated manner so that it leads torapid and orderly development of the region. It is therefore expedient to set up astatutory authority for the purpose of planning, coordinating, executing andsupervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of the areas within greaterShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/82Bombay as well as certain parts of the Thana and Kolaba Districts surrounding it...'.34.17 As one of the main functions of the MMRDA is to secure the 'development' of the MMR as perthe Regional Plan, in order to avoid any impediments to the MMRDA in achieving the aforesaidobjects, Section 31 of the MMRDA Act provides the application of certain other legislatures either ina modified, restricted or excluded manner. Thus, to say that the exclusion contained in Section 31read with Schedule II, Clause II is only restricted to 'land' but the restriction does not apply to the'development' carried out on such land would, in our view, not be correct. Such 'development' iscarried out on land which may or may not be vested in or belonging to MMRDA. If such land isvested in or belonging to MMRDA, such as the Suit Plot, then it would not be possible to bifurcatethe land from the building 'developed' on that land and apply the provisions to the latter but not tothe former.34.18 Our views as noted above are supported by the width of the phrase 'land or building belongingto or vesting in' MMRDA as discussed by us in the former part of SSP 147/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc our findings to this Issue. This is further made clear by the definition of 'land' itself as wehave observed above. A 'development' on the land such as the construction of a building or theutilisation of FSI for carrying out such development are within the definition of 'land'. This being so,we are not inclined to accept the submission that given the dual ownership of land and building,there is room to apply MOFA to the flats owned by the flat purchasers and the developer. Thatwould inevitably result in MOFA being also applied to 'land' that is owned or belonging to theMMRDA. 34.19 Further, the exercise of reading the definition of 'flat' from MOFA and its importinto the scheme of the MMRDA Act is an impermissible reading-in of concepts under MOFA whenMOFA is plainly excluded by MMRDA Act. In view thereof, the judgment in the case of Nahalchand(supra) is not applicable. 34.20 The Learned Amicus Curiae also drew our attention to theImpugned Order, where the Learned Single Judge whilst rejecting the reliefs sought hasnevertheless made a brief observation that the provisions of MOFA which do not prejudice the rightsof MMRDA can be applied inter se between the developer and the flat purchasers. We are of theopinion that since we have considered all aspects of the matter and parties have argued thefundamental legal question of applicability of MOFA per se, even beyond the FSI related issuescanvassed by the Appellants, we are entitled to express our views on the legal issues that arise beforeus. Under Order 41 Rule 22, which would apply to Appeals from Orders by virtue of Order 43 Rule 2,the SSP 148/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc Respondent, though he may not have filed an appeal fromany part of the Order may not only support the Order but may also state that the finding against himin the Court below in respect of any issue ought to have been in his favour. MMRDA is thus entitledto do this qua the observation of the Ld. Single Judge that MOFA applies on MMRDA land asbetween the flat purchasers and the developer even without filing a cross objection as MMRDA isstill supporting the final Order rejecting interim reliefs. We accordingly set aside these observationsof Learned Single Judge in Para 38-39 of the Impugned Order as incorrect as a matter of law whileat the same time uphold the final order of dismissal of the interim application filed by the Plaintiffs /Appellants. 34.21 In view of our reasons, findings and conclusions as noted above, we answer thefirst part of the first issue framed by us in paragraph 14.1 in the affirmative; and the second part ofthe first issue framed by us in paragraph 14.1 in the negative.

The claim of the Appellants as seen from paragraph 37 to 39 and 66 to 67 of the Plaint is thatthey have acquired rights in the Suit Plot, and the additional FSI or any FSI whatsoever in respect ofSuit Plot, which may become available in future, vest in the flat purchasers. The Appellants havespecifically prayed, in prayer clause (a) for a declaration that "...the entire FSI...including the futureFSI ... stood vested in the said flat purchasers including Plaintiffs...". Thus, the Appellants havesought to enforce SSP 149/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc their rights under MOFA in respect of the FSIarising out of the Suit Plot, being a land which undisputedly vests in the MMRDA. The said claim ofthe Appellants is founded on Section 7 of MOFA.35.1 As we have in answer to Issue 1 already held that the applicability of MOFA (and therefore allthe provisions of MOFA) stands excluded as a whole and any application of the provisions of MOFAwould prejudice the rights of MMRDA, we are not required to consider this Issue separately.However, as the parties have made various submissions on this Issue we are considering the same.We note here that the findings hereinbelow are only in addition to the findings for Issue No.1.35.2 Section 7 of MOFA reads as under :"7. After plans and specifications are disclosed no alterations or additions without consent ofpersons who have agreed to take the flats; and defects noticed within [1] [three years] to be rectified: (1) After the plans and specifications of the building, as approved by the local authority asaforesaid, are disclosed or furnished to the person who agrees to take one or more flats, thepromoter shall not make-(i) any alteration in the structures described therein in respect of the flat or flats which are agreed tobe taken,without the previous consent of that person;(ii) any other alterations or additions in the structure of the building without the previous consent ofall the persons who have agreed to take the flats in such building.

Such competent authority,Deputy Chief Engineer or, as the case may be, the other officer of a Board shall, after inquiry, recordhis decision, which shall be final."(Emphasis Supplied) 35.3 From a perusal of Section 7 of MOFA, we understand that the protectionof FSI for the benefit of a Society is premised on the legislative intent for SSP 151/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc the society to eventually obtain a conveyance of the land. Under the scheme of MOFA,since the society of flat purchasers would be entitled to a conveyance of the plot on which theirbuilding stands it follows that any entitlements arising out of such lands which are conveyed or arerequired to be conveyed to the society should belong to the society. Under ordinary circumstanceswhere MOFA is applicable, it is now a settled position of law that general language in an agreementfor sale reserving unto the developer the right to exploit such future FSI does not affect the society'srights under Section 7 and 7A of MOFA. There has to be full and informed consent. However, if asociety is not entitled to a conveyance of the land or is not entitled as a matter of right to anyassignment of the Lease Deed or a sub-lease from the developer, both of which would requireMMRDA's consent, it cannot claim any right to exploitation of FSI, which is a benefit attached torights held in the land by virtue of a conveyance.35.4 As rightly argued by the Learned Amicus Curiae and Shri Jagtiani and Shri Sen, theseprovisions of MOFA cannot be made applicable to MMRDA or lands and buildings owned by orvesting in MMRDA under Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II simply because there is noother provision in law or in any contract to which MMRDA is a party which entitles the Appellantsto a conveyance of the Suit Plot (either of ownership, or as a sub-lease). On the contrary, Clause 15of the Agreement for Sale recognizes that the flat purchasers will not have any right in the SSP152/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc FSI available with respect to the Suit Plot.35.5 A combined reading of the MMRDA Act and Clauses 3(o) of the said Lease Deed makes it clearthat MOFA does not apply to the Suit Plot. That MMRDA retains ownership of the Suit Plot; that theSuit Plot and buildings standing thereon shall be delivered to MMRDA at the end of the leasedperiod and that the leasehold rights granted to the owner cannot be assigned or further sub-leasedShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/85without MMRDA's permission. Thus, the MMRDA Act does not envisage the grant of conveyance orassignment of lease as a matter of right to the flat purchasers for them to be able to stake a claim tothe further FSI being exploited in the remainder of the Suit Plot.35.6 As noted, Section 2(d) of the MMRDA Act defines 'land' to include benefits arising therefrom.Section 3(2) of the MMRDA Act recognizes that MMRDA can acquire, hold and dispose of property,both moveable and immovable. Section 20 of the MMRDA Act provides that property vesting inMMRDA shall be held and applied by it for the purposes and subject to the provisions of theMMRDA Act. Therefore, as per the scheme of the MMRDA Act, MMRDA retains ownership of theSuit Plot and all benefits arising from the Suit Plot, including FSI. The Appellants or association offlat purchasers are not, as a matter of law, entitled to any FSI arising out of the Suit Plot as they arenot entitled to a conveyance of the erstwhile owner's leasehold rights in the Suit Plot. To makeMOFA applicable in this scenario would do SSP 153/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc considerableviolence to the legislative provisions contained in the MMRDA Act and the provisions of the saidLease Deed which are known to the Appellants. 35.7 The fact that persons have purchased flats inbuildings constructed on MMRDA lands does not ipso facto entitle them to a conveyance of theunderlying land in the ownership sense or in the form of a sub-lease from the lessee of MMRDA.MMRDA has the right to consider and permit whether any sub-lease, if any, is to be granted and onwhat terms.35.8 Further it is the Appellants submission that nothing contained in Section 7 or 7A of MOFA willimpinge upon MMRDA's right to exploit FSI in the Suit Plot in the manner of their choosing.MMRDA cannot be compelled to exploit its FSI, but only through a society of flat purchasers. Thatwould be contrary to MMRDA Act and the said Lease Deed.35.9 Further, If MMRDA wants to permit a particular developer to develop MMRDA lands, forpractical considerations such as credibility or convenience of proceeding with a particulardevelopment through one developer as he is constructing on a particular layout, MMRDA cannot bedeprived of the benefit of permitting that developer to allow for economy of scale on the ground thatthe developer in question will require flat purchasers' informed consent for proceeding with thatdevelopment. 35.10 If Section 7 and 7A of MOFA are made applicable to MMRDA land, MMRDA'sright to issue directions to any local authority, other authority or to any SSP 154/159 appl 8104 of2020.doc person with regard to implementation of any development project (which may potentiallyrequire amendment of the layout and sanctioned plans) under Section 14 of the MMRDA Act wouldbe altogether as it would now be subject to the informed consent of the society or association of flatpurchasers under Section 7 and 7A of MOFA.35.11 The conveyance demanded as a matter of right under Section 11 of MOFA, which as notedabove is the rationale for Section 7 and 7A entitlement to exploitation of FSI, extinguishesMMRDA's prerogative under Clause 3(p) of the Lease Deed to consider and permit, on anapplication made in this regard, the sale, mortgage, assignment, underletting or sub-letting of thedemised plot. We hasten to add that we are not required to and do not express any view on thestatus of the buildings constructed on MMRDA land after the lease period is over. A conveyance oreven sub-lease of the plot would dilute or perhaps even extinguish the MMRDA's right to determineShahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/86the lease under Clause 2 of the said Lease Deed. The conveyance or sub-lease ignores and seeks tofrustrate the obligation cast upon the lessee under Clause 3(o) of the Lease Deed to deliverpossession of the demised plot to MMRDA after expiry of the lease. If the Appellants are entitled toa conveyance of the Suit Plot as against MMRDA, MMRDA would lose the right to extract mines andminerals, if any, underlying the Suit Plot as per the rights carved out in Clause 1 of the Lease Deed.SSP                                                                               155/159                                                                      appl 8104 of 2020.doc35.12         For the above reasons, we hold that enforcement of Section 7 of MOFA,as sought to be invoked by the Appellants in the present case, will cause prejudice to or affect therights of MMRDA and therefore such enforcement cannot be allowed. We accordingly answer IssueNo. (ii) framed in paragraph 14.2 in the negative. ISSUE NO. 3: If applicability of MOFA has beenexcluded by the MMRDA Act in respect of a project, can the Developer and flat purchasers contractto incorporate the provisions of MOFA and would those provisions of MOFA bind the parties interse ?36. Shri. Tamboly on behalf of the Appellants has submitted that under Clause 28 of the saidAgreement for Sale, the Developer has specifically agreed to be subject to the provisions of MOFAand therefore cannot now seek to renege from the same.36.1 In response, Shri. Sen and Shri. Jagtiani, have both submitted that once the applicability ofMOFA has been excluded, the developer and flat purchasers under a private arrangement cannotapply the provisions of the MOFA inter se, as the same would affect the rights of MMRDA.36.2 We agree with the submissions of Shri Sen and Shri Jagtiani. Since we have already held thatthe applicability of MOFA as a whole is excluded against MMRDA as well as land or buildingbelonging to or vesting in MMRDA, it cannot be SSP 156/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc madeapplicable by the sidewind of a contract (especially one in which MMRDA is not a party). This wouldundermine the statute i.e. the MMRDA Act and therefore is impermissible. The statutory provisionsthat exclude the applicability of MOFA, as discussed above, are not derogable provisions that can bederogated from in the Agreements for Sale.36.3 In addition, the Agreement for Sale executed between the Appellants and the Developer itselfprovides that the contract will be subject to the said Lease Deed executed between MMRDA and theDeveloper (acting as the Constituted Attorney of the owner). The said Lease Deed in turn providesthat the terms thereof shall be subject to the MMRDA Act. Thus, the parties were at all times awarethat the terms of the said Agreement for Sale are subject to the MMRDA Act and therefore excluded.Hence, even for this reason the Developer and the Appellants cannot agree to incorporate or enforcethe provisions of MOFA inter se. 36.4 Even the Agreement for Sale does not give a clear indicationas to whether MOFA will apply since on the one hand Clause 28 of the Agreement for Sale providesthat MOFA will be applicable to the obligations of the Developer whereas, on the other hand, Clause13.1 of the Agreement for Sale states that the terms thereof are subject to the Lease Deed. There is,Shahed Kamal And 97 Ors vs Pagarani Universal ... on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122468933/87therefore, a fundamental contradiction in the terms of the Agreement for Sale itself which indirectlyacknowledges the applicability of MMRDA Act but also provides for the application of MOFA whichis inconsistent SSP 157/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc with Section 31 read with Schedule II to theMMRDA Act.36.5 Our aforesaid view is also supported by the judgment of this Court in Bank of Baroda (supra)wherein it was held at paragraph 11 that even though the parties are bound by the terms of theagreement, still the terms of the agreement which are contrary to the provisions of law or anystatutory requirements, cannot be complied with.36.6 For the reasons aforesaid we hold that the since the applicability of MOFA has been excludedby the MMRDA Act, the Developer and flat purchasers contract to incorporate the provisions ofMOFA and even if done the same cannot bind the parties inter se.37. We must note here that the Appellants have also made various submissions and relied on variousjudgments to contend that the Developer is constructing the said Additional Building withoutobtaining the informed consent of the flat purchasers. Since we have already held that theapplicability of MOFA as a whole has been excluded by Section 31 read with Schedule II, Clause II ofthe MMRDA Act, we hold that there was no requirement for the Developer to obtain the consent ofthe flat purchasers before commencing the construction of Additional Building. What was necessaryfor the Developer was to obtain the permission from the MMRDA, which is the owner of the SuitPlot as well as the Planning Authority and the same has been done. Additional premium forexploiting the further FSI has been SSP 158/159 appl 8104 of 2020.doc paid. The Developer has alsodeveloped the reservation on the Suit Plot and handed over the same to MMRDA as required as acondition for developing the Suit Plot.38. We therefore find no infirmity in the Impugned Order except to the extent of the observationspecified in para 34.20 hereinabove.39. The Appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.40. We would like to conclude by expressing our appreciation to Shri Rohaan Cama, the LearnedAmicus Curiae and Shri Shanay Shah, who assisted him in this matter.( MILIND N.
