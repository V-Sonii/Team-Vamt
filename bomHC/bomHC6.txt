She has admitted that on her own, shehad not gone to the police station. She has admitted that accused No.3 is the only legal heir to thedeceased.22] According to the defense, the evidence of PW-1 is not consistent with the medical evidence. Itwould be therefore, Dinesh Sherla 8/13 j-cri-appeal-584-17-976-15-1167-15@ ia.odt appropriate atthis stage to refer to the medical evidence.23] According to PW-11 Dr. Sanjay Wathore, on 01.10.2013, he was working as Medical Ofcer atRajawadi Hospital. On that day, the dead body of Kamal H.

Right lower incisor missing.25] According to PW-11, all the injuries were ante-mortem. According to him, on internalexamination, he found that there was contusion under scalp on occipital region 16 cm x 9 cm.Meninges were congested. Larynx, Trachea and Bronchi contains bloodstained froth. Both lungshaving pneumonic consolidation. Hearth contains patechial heamorrhages. Bucal cavity teeth,tongue and pharynix - teeth loosed and lost lower right incisor. Tongue bitten between teeth.Stomach contains 100 ml of semi digested semi solid, unidentifable food material. Mucosa normal.He preserved Viscera for histopathology. According to him, the cause of death was due DineshSherla 9/13 j-cri-appeal-584-17-976-15-1167-15@ ia.odt to asphyxia with smothering.26] PW-11 in his cross-examination has admitted that no fnal opinion as to cause of death was givenon the day of postmortem examination. He has also admitted that due to sudden heart stroke, deathcan be caused. He also admitted that due to clot in brain death can be caused and it is called as brainhaemorrhage. He also admitted that person sufering from hyper tension may sufer from brainhaemorrhage. He also admitted that there were no marks on the neck of deceased and hyoid bonewas not fractured. PW-11 has further admitted that if neck is pressed by force, hyoid bone getsfractured. He has further admitted that Marbling do not occur due to pressing.27] PW-11 has admitted that he did peruse the inquest panchanama and no injuries were mentionedthere. He has further admitted that the inquest panchanama is silent about oozing of blood fromnostrils and mouth. PW-11, has, however, volunteered that it starts oozing when decompositionstarts.28] According to PW-1, the neck of the deceased was pressed. However, PW-11 has admitted thatthere were no marks on the neck of the deceased. According to PW-1, even the mouth of deceasedwas pressed. However, no marks or injuries were found on the face of deceased. It, thus appears thatthe evidence of PW-1 is not consistent with the medical Dinesh Sherla 10/13j-cri-appeal-584-17-976-15-1167-15@ ia.odt evidence.29] PW-1 at the time of lodging of FIR has stated that there was dispute between the deceased andaccused No.3 on account of ownership of the house where they were residing. PW-1 has, however, inexamination-in-chief itself pleaded ignorance about the cause of dispute. Apart from it, PW-1 hasadmitted that the accused No.3 is the only legal heir to the deceased. If this is so then it is difcult toaccept that there was dispute between the deceased and the accused No.3, on account of ownershipof the house in which they were residing.30] Apart from above, PW-4 Sulochana Desai, the mother of PW-1 has admitted in hercross-examination that she does not own any room in Mumbai. She got inducted her name in theration card of the deceased. She has further admitted that the house owned by the deceased wascovered by SRA scheme. The defense of the accused No.3 before the trial court was that she has beenMangesh Arjun Bhosale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 17 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125122144/6implicated in a false case by PW-4 and others to grab house property owned by her mother(deceased). Considering the admission of PW-4 in cross- examination the said possibility cannot beruled out.31] PW-4 has further admitted that prior to the incident, her daughter (PW-1) never went to residewith the deceased. Considering this admission and overall conduct of PW-1, it would not be safe torely upon the evidence of PW-1 to Dinesh Sherla 11/13 j-cri-appeal-584-17-976-15-1167-15@ ia.odtconnect the accused with alleged crime.32] Apart from above, admittedly, no opinion in relation to cause of death was given after thepostmortem was conducted and it was kept pending till receipt of histopathological report. Itappears that opinion of PW-11 in relation to cause of death came to be obtained only two days priorto recording of his evidence. PW-11 has admitted that he did peruse the inquest panchanama beforeconducting postmortem examination and no injuries were mentioned in the inquest panchanamaand even it is silent with regard to oozing of blood from nostrils and mouth. PW-11 has furtheradmitted that marbling do not occur due to pressing. The trial court has not at all considered allthese facts and with cryptic fnding concluded that the deceased had died homicidal death. The trialcourt was thus not justifed in holding that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonabledoubt. In the result, the following order is passed.                                       ORDER          a]      All Criminal Appeals are allowed.         b]       The          impugned    judgment           and       order        dated12.08.2015 passed by the Ad-hoc Additional Sessions Judge, City Civil and Sessions Court atMumbai in Sessions Case No. 233 of 2014 convicting the appellants viz.
