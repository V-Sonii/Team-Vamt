Kailash (S.B) 193 (2012) DLT 168.CS No.96441/16                                                               Pg 30 of 51                                                   Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.     ISSUE NO.1Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree of declaration, as prayed for in the prayer clause (i) and(ii)? OPP.12. In prayer clause (i) of the plaint, the plaintiff has sought declaration that a revocation deed dated29.07.2005 (Mark H) executed by defendant no.1 be declared null and void. As per the claim of theplaintiff, the said revocation deed of defendant no.1 seeks to revoke the GPA and SPA issued infavour of the plaintiff. At the outset, what assumes importance is the ground for such cancellation. Itis the claim of the plaintiff that defendant no.1 had executed a General Power of Attorney, SpecialPower of Attorney, Receipt and two affidavits dated 01.09.1999 regarding property No. Flat bearingNo.941, Vikas Kunj, Vikaspuri, New Delhi in favour of the plaintiff. Further that the General powerof attorney was irrevocable and therefore the same could not have been revoked. The plea of theplaintiff seems to be based upon the premise that the impugned document i.e., the revocation deed,is void in the eyes of law since it could not have been executed as the power of attorney wasirrevocable. Alongwith this, the plea of the plaintiff also appears to have arisen out of the rightclaimed on the basis of GPA, SPA etc executed in her favour. Therefore, the present suit is a blend ofremedies under CS No.96441/16 Pg 31 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.Section 31 and 34 of Specific Performance Act, 1963.Smt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/1413. Having said that, what may be noted is that plaintiff has brought on record, General Power ofAttorney - Ex.PW1/9 (OSR), Special Power of Attorney - Ex.PW1/8 (OSR), Receipt - Ex.PW1/10(OSR), Affidavits - Ex.PW1/11 and Ex.PW1/12 (OSR) allegedly executed by the defendant no.1 infavour of the plaintiff. The General Power of Attorney and the Special Power of Attorney are bothregistered documents. Therefore, their execution has to be presumed unless rebutted. It is verysignificant to note that except giving a suggestion that these documents are forged and fabricated,defendant did not make any attempt to challenge the execution of or otherwise disprove thedocuments. At this point, it may be mentioned that a written statement was filed by the defendantno.1 and the same was adopted by the LRs of the defendant no.1, however, vide order dated26.09.2016, amended written statement of LRs of defendant no.1 was taken on record. The court isaware that had the LRs filed an additional written statement, still the original one filed by defendantcould have been considered, however, here since the written statement was allowed to be amended,it has an effect of nullifying all previous written statements. In the amended written statement, it isthe CS No.96441/16 Pg 32 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.stand of LRs of the defendant that defendant no.1 had no right, title or interest in the property norhe executed any document in favor of the plaintiff. Rather it is claimed that Sh. H.S. Sandhu, theoriginal allottee of the suit property had executed power of attorneys in favour of Lt. Cdr. AnilWasan on 22.05.1987 and 25.04.1992. Further that Lt. Cdr. Anil Wasan sold the suit property toSmt. Rupa Rani Sharma (wife of defendant no.1) on 05.06.1992 by way of Will, Agreement to Sell,Receipt, Indemnity Bond, Affidavit and Agreement to appoint Arbitrator. However, no evidence hasbeen led on behalf of defendant no.1 in the present suit, leave aside the proof of such documents.Therefore, the contentions of the defendant no.1 remain mere assertions.14. Consequently, it emerges that the validity of GPA, SPA and other documents dated 01.07.1999i.e. Ex.PW1/8 to Ex.PW1/12 remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, it is to be seen whether this factentitles the plaintiff to seek declaration of revocation deed dated 29.07.2005, as null and void, ornot.15. At this juncture, I must take into account the law laid down in Hardip Kaur v. Kailash (S.B) 193(2012) DLT 168 and in Ramesh Chand v. Suresh Chand, 188 (2012) DLT 538, wherein it was heldthat the Power of CS No.96441/16 Pg 33 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.Attorney given for a consideration coupled with interest is irrevocable under Section 202 of theContract Act, 1872 and subsists even after the death of the executant.16. The court is conscious that in the above referred judgments, there was an agreement to sell in theset of documents containing GPA, Affidavit etc and that the word "interest" was interpreted incontext of that agreement. However, for better clarity, it would also be beneficial to take note of ajudgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court in T. Sivaperuaml vs. S.Viswanathan 2014 (1) CTC 447.18. Though that power of attorney did not state that it is a document coupled with interest, thepossession has been given and also the original title deeds have also been given. In suchcircumstances, can he be allowed to cancel the power without notice?. P.W.1 himself categoricallySmt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/15date of power of attorney and he also admitted that he did not question the original sale deed, at anypoint of time, executed in favour of the appellant as per the power of attorney. Therefore, normally,when a power of attorney is executed, nobody will hand over the possession or the original titledeeds, coupled with the fact that the parties are close relatives and the first plaintiff/ the firstrespondent is not an CS No.96441/16 Pg 34 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.This vital aspect has not been considered by the both the Courts below.19. The Courts below should have taken into consideration that unless there is power of attorneywith coupled interest, the handing over of the document and the handing over of the possession willnot arise at all. Therefore, in the admission of the plaintiff, it is very clear that he handed over thepossession. He also handed over the title deeds. Therefore, definitely, this has to be construed as thepower of attorney with coupled interest. It is further clearly proved that the entire sale considerationhas been received under Ex.B.4. The signature in that exhibit is admitted.17. If taken holistically, the sense of the judgments and the law discussed reveal that when a powerof attorney is executed against a consideration and even the title documents and possession arehanded over to the attorney then the attorney gains some interest in the property and is not a mereattorney.18. On that note, it is pertinent to consider that plaintiff has brought in evidence a receipt showing35 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.document challenged effectively. In fact, the witness was only questioned on the aspect of paymentof consideration to the original allottee Sh. H.S. Sandhu. Surprisingly, when witness answered thathe does not have any knowledge about the same and he had paid the consideration to Sh. P.K.Sharma (defendant no.1), he was not put any question or any suggestion. Meaning thereby,plaintiff's claim of payment of consideration to defendant no.1 has gone unrebutted. Thus, meredenial in the written statement is of no help to the defendant. Secondly, it is nowhere disputed thatplaintiff is in possession of the property. Though it is the claim of the LRs of defendant no.1 that theplaintiff was allowed to reside in the suit property as a gratuitous licencee being an additionaldirector in the company of the defendant no.1. However, it bears repetition to state that since nodefendant no.1 during your service tenure with Income Wires and Cables Ltd.?" which was indeedanswered in affirmative, however, it was no where categorically put as to in what capacity thepossession was given. Merely because the possession was given during CS No.96441/16 Pg 36 of 51Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.Smt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/16the tenure of the service does not prove that it was given as a licencee. Rather, being in completecontrast to the contention of LRs in the written statement regarding licence without any fee or rent,to the deceased defendant no.1 or not. Even otherwise, even if the contention of the defendant istaken to be true, there is no such bar in law that capacity in which a person holds possession of theimmovable property cannot be changed.19. What is also worth noting that the plaintiff has brought on record even the previous chain ofdocuments in favour of Sh. H.S. Sandhu, the original allottee and in favour of defendant no.1. In thebackdrop of the judgments, referred above, this aspect assumes significance. In addendum, I shallnot skip to understand the sense of the documents executed in favour of the plaintiff by defendant(OSR) uses the words "full and final payment of the sale consideration".20. The above facts and circumstances put together suggest that the Power CS No.96441/16 Pg 37 of51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.of Attorneys executed by defendant no.1 were in fact irrevocable in view of Section 202 of IndianContract Act, 1872.21. In so far as, argument of the defendant that defendant no.1 never had any title in the suitproperty and rather wife of the defendant no.1 had the interest and title in the property, ishave gone unrebutted for the reasons discussed above. These documents contain power of attorneyexecuted by the original allottee in favor of the defendant no.1 on 16.06.1992. Though plaintiff hasalso brought a receipt issued by the original allottee in the name of Smt. Rupa Rani Sharma,however, it cannot be lost sight of that under Indian Law, consideration can flow from a strangeralso. More so, despite existence of certain more documents in favour of Rupa Rani Sharma, thefactum of execution of power of attorney coupled with interest in favour of the plaintiff by defendantno.1 cannot be belied.22. Consequently, it can be said that the defendant no.1 was not entitled to revoke the power ofattorney. In addendum, though indeed an agency can be revoked expressly or impliedly (section 207Indian Contract Act, 1872), however, it is also worth noting that the GPA, SPA etc executed CSNo.96441/16 Pg 38 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.in favour of the plaintiff were registered documents and they could not be simply cancelled by wayof an unregistered revocation deed, that too without informing about the same to the plaintiff. Forthis purpose, I must take aid from judgment of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in Chandrama Singhand Ors. v. Mirza Anis Ahmad 2011 SCC OnLine All 528 wherein it was held:15. The law is, therefore, absolutely clear. A registered document cannot be nullifiedby actions such as of filing police complaints. When there is a requirement ofSmt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/17registration of a document that intends to cancel a previous registered documentdealing with rights to immovable property then the previous registered documentwhere from rights flowed and were created cannot be annulled except through theproper procedure.16. In the case of S. Saktivel (supra) the Supreme Court laid down in paragraph 6 that'the terms of a registered document can be altered, rescinded or varied only by asubsequent registered document and not otherwise'.23. Before concluding, in the backdrop of the above discussion, it is prudent to note the definition ofthe word 'proved' as contained in Section 3 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 i.e., "Proved" .--A fact issaid to be proved CS No.96441/16 Pg 39 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers itsexistence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, toact upon the supposition that it exists. Also, it would be unwise to ignore the standard of proof in acivil case which is preponderance of probabilities which as a phrase means more probable andrational view of the case. (Rishi Kesh Singh & Ors. vs The State AIR 1970 All 51). Ergo, in view of theobservations made herein above, it can be safely concluded that the rational view of the casestrongly tilts in the favour of the plaintiff.24. I must also advert to observations of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Shri Raj Kumar Singh & Anr.V. Mrs. Jagjit Chawla & Others. (2011) DLT 418 which were as under:14. A civil case is decided on balance of probabilities. The balance of probabilities inwere duly executed by the deceased Sh.Sohan Singh. The Power of Attorney is after all a registered Power of Attorney, and moreimportantly, the original title documents of the subject property are in the possession of therespondent no.1 and which would not have been, if there was not to be any transfer of title in the suitproperty. Merely because two views are CS No.96441/16 Pg 40 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod KumarSharma & Anr.possible, this court would not interfere with one possible and plausible view which is taken by thecourt below, unless such view causes grave injustice. In my opinion, in fact, grave injustice will beSewa Singh, if the impugned judgment is set aside.25. In view of the above discussion, it can be concluded that the plaintiff has discharged the onus ofproof of this issue. However, it may be clarified that it is a settled law that the documents like powerof attorney, agreement to sell etc. do not confer ownership and therefore, the findings above havebeen given bearing in mind only the limited question involved about the validity of revocation deedSmt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/18and nothing herein shall suggest anything upon the ownership of the plaintiff.26. Now coming to prayer clause (ii), it has been sought that the plaintiff be declared a regularmember of the defendant no.2 society. At the outset, I must note the bare wording of Section 34 ofSpecific Relief Act, 1963:34. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right: Any person entitled to anylegal character, or to any right as to any property, may institute a suit against anyperson denying, or interested to deny, his title to such 2 character or right, and theCourt may in its discretion make therein a CS No.96441/16 Pg 41 of 51 Alka Rastogi v.Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for anyfurther relief:PROVIDED that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, beingable to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so.Explanation: A trustee of property is a "person interested to deny" a title adverse tothe title of someone who is not in existence, and for whom, if in existence, he wouldbe a trustee.existence of that character. The word 'declaration' itself suggests that the court has to merely declarethe right and not confer the right the first time. If for a moment, I interpret the provision as one alsoempowering the court to confer a right which by implicitly involves performance of an act by thedefendant, it would rather be a replica of relief of mandatory injunction. Besides, the term 'legalcharacter' denotes a character derived by some method recognized by law. Had the declaration bycourt would have conferred the character first time, the word 'legal' must not have been used in theprovision already. Ergo, the sense and the spirit of the provision suggests that a declaration is of analready existing character or right.CS No.96441/16 Pg 42 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.28. Having taken note of that, it is the claim of the plaintiff herself that the plaintiff was notconferred with the membership of the defendant no.2 society despite being valid documents in herfavour. Therefore, certainly as on the date of the suit she had no legal character of being a memberof the defendant no.2 society which can be declared. It is being borne in mind that as per theplaintiff, defendant no.2 is a registered society under Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, 2003,therefore, without certain compliances and formalities, no person can become a regular membermerely on the strength of the documents even if valid. It is also inevitable to consider Section 91 ofDelhi Cooperative Societies Act, 2003 which reads as under:91. A member of a housing society who has sold his plot or flat on the power ofattorney or agreement for sale or by sale deed, shall cease to be a member of thatSmt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/19society from the date of the sale of plot or flat: Provided that the purchaser havingregistered power of attorney or registered agreement for sale or registered sale deed,as the case may be, in respect of such plot or flat, may apply for membership bypaying transfer fee of five hundred rupees and share money and admission fee as permembership to the applicant within thirty days after the submission of CSNo.96441/16 Pg 43 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.his application. In case of refusal by the committee, the applicant may appeal to theRegistrar within thirty days and the decision of the Registrar shall be final: Providedfurther that no purchaser shall be entitled for more than one membership in ahousing society.29. The provision clearly and categorically lays down certain compliances before a person can begranted a membership on the basis of a power of attorney, by the society. More so, in case of anydenial, the remedy is appeal before the Registrar. It bears repetition to say that plaintiff has reliedupon letter of the defendant no.2 society dated 01.08.2005 (Ex.PW4/3) in which though it hadoriginal allottee only, stating that till the locus of the plaintiff is not established and the receipt shallbe kept at society's office. Therefore, patently, there were neither any grant of membership to theplaintiff nor anything has come on record showing further completion of formalities. Ergo, theplaintiff cannot be declared as a regular member of the defendant no.2 society.30. Hence, this issue is partially decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant to theextent of prayer clause (i).CS No.96441/16                                                                  Pg 44 of 51                                                   Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.     ISSUE NO.2Whether plaintiff is entitled for the decree of permanent injunction, as prayed for in prayer clause(iii), (iv) and (v)? OPP31. Firstly, taking up prayer clause no.(iii). Plaintiff has sought permanent injunction restrainingdefendant no.2 from mutating/transferring/enrolling any third party as a member in respect of thesuit property i.e. Flat bearing No.941, Vikas Kunj, Vikaspuri, New Delhi. It is a settled law thatpermanent injunction can be granted if the plaintiff has an obligation in his/her favor that has beenor is about to be breached by the defendant. (Section 38 of Specific Relief Act, 1963).32. In this connection, I have already noted that the plaintiff is not yet a regular member of thedefendant no.2 society. Though indeed she has placed on record house tax receipts and documentsshowing that she had paid some outstanding dues to the society, however, it is in admitted fact thatSmt. Alka Rastogi vs Sh. Pramod Kumar Sharma (Now ... on 9 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33035291/20she has not yet been made a member of the defendant no.2 society. Therefore, unless until, plaintiffcomplies with provisions of Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, 2003 and fulfills all formalities, she isnot entitled to such relief restraining the defendant no.2 completely from mutating/ transferring/enrolling any third party as a member of the society with respect to suit property. Nonetheless, inprayer clause no.CS No.96441/16 Pg 45 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.(vi), plaintiff has claimed mandatory injunction directing the defendant no.2 to enroll/register thename of the plaintiff as a regular member in their records for all legal purposes. Therefore, thisaspect covered under this issue can again be taken up with issue no.3.33. So far as relief no.(iv) is concerned which seeks permanent injunction restraining defendantno.1, his legal heirs, successors, attorneys, servant etc from executing any documents in respect ofthe suit property, it has already been held in issue no.1 that an irrevocable power of attorney interms of Section 202 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 has been executed by defendant no.1 in favour ofthe plaintiff meaning thereby that defendant no.1 is left with no rights to further transfer any title inthe suit property. It bears repetition to say that defendants have not brought even iota of evidence intheir favour nor they could effectively shake the testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses, therefore,there is no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to the injunction asprayed for in clause (iv) on the strength of the documents.34. Under prayer clause (v) of the relief part of the plaint, permanent injunction restrainingdefendant from creating any hindrance and obstruction in the peaceful enjoyment and use of thesuit property by the CS No.96441/16 Pg 46 of 51 Alka Rastogi v. Pramod Kumar Sharma & Anr.plaintiff, has been sought. It is pertinent to consider that defendant no.1, the only contestingdefendant, has not denied the possession of the plaintiff in the suit property. In fact, as per the ownclaim of the defendant, the plaintiff was put in possession of the suit property at least prior to 2004.Thus, there is no denial of settled possession of the plaintiff. Further, it is evident from the findingsabove that the plaintiff has proved her claim of possession on the basis of documents includingpower of attorney whereas defendant no.1 failed to prove his claim of handing over possession of thesuit property on licence basis. In that scenario, defendant no.1 against whom (in view of thediscussion herein above) plaintiff has better title, has no right to dispossess the plaintiff from thesuit property. This can rather be said more firmly, since a person having better title can even seekback possession from a trespasser or any person except true owner, then there is no reason whysuch person cannot be granted protection of possession. In this context, it would also be beneficialto reproduce an extract from Hardip Kaur (supra) in the backdrop of GPA sales:(ix) The purchaser would though not be the classical owner of the suit property aswould an owner be under a duly registered sale deed, but surely he would have betterCS No.96441/16 Pg 47 of 51 Alka Rastogi v.

Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to retain peaceful possession of the suit property as againstdefendant no.1.36. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant to the extent ofprayer clause (iv) and (v) only. ISSUE NO.3 Whether plaintiff is entitled to mandatory injunction, asprayed for in the prayer clause (vi)? OPP.37. In prayer clause (vi), plaintiff has sought mandatory injunction that defendant no.2 be directedto enroll/register the name of the plaintiff as a regular member in their records for all legalpurposes.notice by defendant no.2 society to the residents regarding implementation of Delhi CooperativeSocieties Act, 2003 (amended). While referring to Section CS No.96441/16 Pg 48 of 51 Alka Rastogiv.

In the present facts and circumstances,plaintiff has proved existence of power of attorney executed by defendant no.1 as an attorney oforiginal allottee and the revocation deed dated 29.07.2005 has been declared as null and void.Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to avail the benefit of such notice of the society dated 15.07.2005r/w Section 91 of Delhi Cooperative Societies Act. However, it may be mentioned that there has beena lapse of almost 17 years since this notice, therefore, the court cannot ascertain if the rules,compliances and the conditions are still the same as on date.39. In view of these observations, defendant no.2 is directed to enroll plaintiff as member of thesociety subject to compliances in accordance with its rules/regulations and provisions of the DelhiCooperative Societies Act, 2003.ISSUE NO.4 Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the cost of litigation, as prayed for in the prayerclause (vii)?
