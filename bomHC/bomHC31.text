Penal Code, 1860 – Ss. 384, 386, 387 r/w. 34 – After investigation a charge sheet was submitted under the provisions of the IPC as well as under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) – Question of quashing and setting aside the wrong order passed by the court releasing the accused on bail.It is required to be noted that by the detailed judgment and order, the learned Special Judge/MCOCA refused to release the accused on bail. The accused challenged the same before the High Court. The bail application preferred by the accused was heard by the learned Single judge. Learned Single Judge was not inclined to release the accused on bail and therefore the accused withdrew the same and thereafter preferred the writ petition before the Division Bench of the High Court under the guise of challenging the vires of MCOCA and without noticing the above, the Division Bench of the High Court has released the accused on bail that too by way of interim relief, which otherwise the accused could not get before the learned Single Judge and he withdrew the bail application. The aforesaid can be said to be forum shopping by the accused which is highly deprecated and which cannot be approved. On this ground also, the accused is not entitled to be released on bail and the impugned order passed by the High Court releasing the accused onbail deserves to be quashed and set aside.Bail – Setting aside the wrong order releasing the accused on bail and to cancel the bail of the accused on misuse of liberty etc., both stand on different footing and the different criteria shall be applicable.Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.R. Shah pronounced the reportable judgment of the Bench comprising His Lordship and Hon’ble Mr. Justice Sanjiv Khanna.For Appellant(s) Mr. Sachin Patil, AOR Mr. Rahul Chitnis, Adv Mr. Aaditya A. Pande, Adv. Mr. Geo Joseph, Adv. For Respondent(s) Mr. Aditya Verma, AOR
