He also founded the HaryanaLawn Tennis Association (HLTA) in the year 1988.(b) The office of HLTA was established in the garage of House No. 469, Sector 6, Panchkula, anunder construction building owned by the appellant- accused which was divided into three portionswherein front portion was being used as the office of HLTA and the other two portions were beingutilized by T. Thomas and Kuldeep Singh, Coach and Manager respectively of the Association forresidential purposes. HLTA enrolled several member players who were mostly nearby residents ofPanchkula on payment of monthly subscription.S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/1(c) Ms. Ruchika (since deceased), daughter of Shri S.C. Girhotra and Ms. Aradhana @ Reemu,daughter of Shri Anand Prakash and Madhu Prakash (the complainant), both aged about 15 years,residents of Panchkula got themselves enrolled as members of the HLTA. Both of them were goodfriends and used to go together for practice at the Tennis court. The appellant- accused was also afrequent visitor to the said Tennis court. One day, when Ms. Ruchika informed theappellant-accused about her plan to go abroad, the appellant-accused met her father-Shri S.C.Girhotra on 11.08.1990 in order to persuade him to not to send his daughter out of the country forspecialized tennis coaching and promised that special coaching would be arranged for her at HLTAitself and also asked him to send Ruchika to his office on the very next day in connection with thesame. Shri Girhotra informed the same to his daughter-Ruchika and asked her to meet theappellant-accused in his office on 12.08.1990.(d) On 12.08.1990, Ms. Ruchika visited the house of Ms. Aradhana and told her about the visit of theappellant-accused to her house and also that he had called her in his office. When both of them werepracticing in the tennis court, Paltoo-the ball picker, informed Ms. Ruchika that theappellant-accused had called her in his office. Accordingly, Ms. Ruchika along with Ms. Aradhanawent to meet the appellant-accused who was standing outside the office at that particular point oftime. The appellant-accused insisted them to come inside the office. On his insistence, both the girlswent inside the office. The appellant-accused got fetched one chair which was occupied by Ms.Aradhana and Ms. Ruchika kept standing on the right side of Ms. Aradhana while theappellant-accused sat in his chair which was on the other side of the table. The appellant-accusedrequested Ms. Aradhana to call for Mr. Thomas-the Coach. Accordingly, Ms. Aradhana went outsideleaving behind the appellant-accused and Ms. Ruchika in the office. Ms. Aradhana asked the personwho fetched the chair for her in the office to inform the Coach to come to the office of theappellant-accused. However, the Coach refused to come.(e) Immediately thereafter, when Ms. Aradhana returned to the office, she witnessed that Ms.Ruchika was in the grip of the appellant-accused, who was holding one hand of Ruchika in his handand his other hand was around her waist. The appellant-accused was pulling her towards his chestso as to embrace her and Ruchika was trying to push him back with her free hand.(f) On seeing Ms. Aradhana (PW-13), the appellant-accused got frightened and released Ms. Ruchikaand fell on his chair. The appellant-accused asked Ms. Aradhana to go out of his room again andpersonally bring the coach with her. The appellant-accused insisted Ruchika to stay in his room, butshe somehow managed to escape. When Aradhana was about to go behind Ruchika, theappellant-accused told her Ask her to cool down, I will do whatever she will say. After listening tothis, Ms. Aradhana also ran behind Ms. Ruchika to enquire about the matter. Thereafter, Ruchikanarrated the whole incident to her. After discussion, both the girls decided not to inform the same totheir parents as the appellant-accused, being IG of Police, could involve or harass them and theirparents.(g) On 14.08.1990, Ms. Ruchika along with Ms. Aradhana went to the lawn tennis court at about4:30 p.m., instead of their usual timing, in order to avoid the appellant-accused, who used to visitthe court in the evening. When both the girls were about to return, at about 6:30 p.m., Mr. Paltoo-S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/2the ball picker, came out of the court and told Ms. Ruchika that the appellant-accused had called herin his office. However, Ms. Ruchika refused to meet him and pointed out to Ms. Aradhana that sincethey had not informed their parents about the mis-behaviour of the appellant-accused on12.08.1990, the appellant-accused was feeling emboldened and had again called her to his officewith a view to molest her. Thereafter, both of them decided to disclose the incident that took placeon 12.08.1990 to their respective parents. Accordingly, Ruchika narrated the incident of hermolestation at the hands of the appellant-accused to her father, Shri S. C. Girhotra. Also, the parentsof Ms. Aradhana were made aware of the entire incident.(h) On hearing this, Shri S.C. Girhotra, gathered the residents of the locality, who were mostlyparents of trainee boys and girls, and they went to the HLTA office to meet the appellant-accusedbut they were informed that the appellant-accused had already left for Chandigarh. On 15.08.1990, aMemorandum/petition, duly signed by Ms. Ruchika, Ms. Aradhana, Mr. Anand Prakash and Ms.Madhu Prakash-father and mother of Ms. Aradhana, was presented to the then Secretary (Home),Haryana. After the approval of the Home Minister, Shri R.R. Singh, the then DGP was directed tohold an inquiry into the allegations leveled against the appellant-accused in theMemorandum/petition.(i) After conducting the enquiry into the incident, Shri R.R. Singh concluded that the allegation ofmolestation is based on true facts and a cognizable case is made out against the appellant-accusedunder the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the IPC) and forwarded his enquiryreport dated 03.09.1990 to the Secretary (Home), Government of Haryana.(j) During investigation it was also revealed that after the incident of molestation, Ms. Ruchikaconfined herself in her house. Later, on 28.12.1993, she committed suicide by consuming poison anddied on 29.12.1993.(k) The enquiry report by Shri R.R. Singh was examined by the Legal Division of the Government ofHaryana in 1990 and 1992 which also recommended for registration of a case against theappellant-accused. Madhu Prakash-the complainant/Respondent No. 2 herein requested severalauthorities in the Government of Haryana for registration of a case but no action was taken onwhich she filed a Criminal Writ Petition being No. 1694 of 1997 before the Punjab and Haryana HighCourt. The High Court, vide order dated 21.08.1998, issued direction to the Superintendent ofPolice, Panchkula that after registration of the case, the investigation shall be handed over to theCentral Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the same shall be conducted by an officer not below therank of DIG.

Being aggrieved by the order dated23.10.2001, the appellant- accused preferred Criminal Misc. Petition being No. 44607-M/2011before the High Court.

Viswanathan, learned senior counsel for the appellant- accused and Ms. VibhaDatta Makhija, learned senior counsel for the CBI and Shri Vikas Mehta, learned counsel forRespondent No. 2. Rival contentions:4) Learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused contended that given the situation of the HLTAmake shift office in a garage at the relevant point of time along with the presence of a number ofpeople including labourers, it would be impossible to even try for such an act, knowing well that theact can be seen by others. Learned senior counsel further contended that the prosecution story isabsolutely false and frivolous and the appellant-accused has been framed in the present case by thecomplainant party and the high level officers of the State with an ulterior motive. TheS.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/4appellant-accused neither visited the house of Shri S.C. Girhotra nor asked for a meeting withRuchika on 12.08.1990 in HLTA office. It was further argued that the Memorandum/petition hasbeen drafted after prolonged consideration and deliberation by several interested persons includingsome senior police officers of the State of Haryana. The name of the players who were allegedlyaccompanying Ms. Ruchika at the relevant time has not been mentioned in the Memorandumintentionally and later on Ms. Aradhana has been planted as Sathi Khiladi. It was contended that thewords Sathi Khiladi have been mentioned in the Memorandum for the purpose of introducing aneye witness of choice. Learned senior counsel further contended that the signature of Ms. Ruchikaon the alleged Memorandum is false and forged and on this ground, the document cannot be reliedupon. This document does not disclose the details of the incident and merely suggests that theappellant-accused misbehaved with Ms. Ruchika which does not attract Section 354 of the IPC.5) Learned senior counsel further contended that no complaint was filed by Ms. Ruchika or herfather Shri S.C. Girhotra or Shri Ashu - elder brother of Ms. Ruchika or Mrs. Madhu Prakash(PW-2) or Sh. Anand Prakash (PW-1) or by Ms. Aradhana (PW-13) in the police station. Even after14.08.1990, when Ms. Ruchika and Ms. Aradhana allegedly informed their parents, none of themapproached the police to get the FIR registered. The police post, Sector 6, Panchkula is at a distanceof 300 yards only from the tennis court. It is situated very near to the house of Shri S.C. Girhotraalso. In this way undue and unexplained delay resulted in manipulations and proper version couldnot be put forth before the court.6) Learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused further contended that the inquiry conductedby Shri R.R. Singh was without jurisdiction as the appellant-accused, at the relevant point of time,was on deputation with the BBMB and was not under the administrative control of the Governmentof Haryana. He further contended that the IAS lobby in the Government of Haryana was entirelyagainst the appellant-accused and it had colluded with Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1) and othersagainst the appellant- accused. He further pointed out the reason that there was rivalry between thetwo tennis associations, one headed by the appellant-accused and one formed later on by the IASgroup with Shri J.K. Duggal, Secretary (Home) as its President with the patronage of Shri B.S. Ojha.It was further contended from the side of the appellant-accused that before forming the HaryanaTennis Association (HTA), the IAS lobby pressurized the appellant- accused to step down from thePresidentship of HLTA in favour of Shri B.S. Ojha to which the appellant-accused refused whichannoyed Shri B.S. Ojha, who had strong reasons for ordering the enquiry by Shri R.R. Singh andpolice officers working under him had organized the drafting of the said Memorandum against theappellant-accused. The enquiry conducted by Shri R.R. Singh cannot be relied upon because noenquiry could be marked to him and also he has not held the enquiry in proper manner. It wasfurther submitted by learned senior counsel that the media has played a negative role in the presentcase and published the selective news items only in collusion with the complainant party. Thematerial witnesses like ball picker - Paltoo and Coach - K.T. Thomas, who were allegedly present atthe place of alleged incident, have not been examined by the prosecution. Further, the witnesseshave made a lot of improvements and there are other discrepancies also in the statements ofwitnesses and therefore, the same could not have been relied upon by the courts below. Learnedsenior counsel finally contended that the case of the prosecution is false and frivolous, the net resultof which is that the prosecution has failed to prove its case and the appellant-accused is entitled toS.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/5be acquitted.7) Per contra, learned senior counsel for the CBI submitted that the occurrence is well proved by theunimpeachable testimony of Ms. Aradhana (PW-13). The eye witness stood with her testimony tillend and therefore, the contention urged on behalf of the appellant-accused with regard to the aboveevidence has no relevance or substance. On a careful examination of the statement of PW-13, it canbe very easy to arrive at the conclusion that there was every possibility that Ms. Ruchika could havebeen embraced by the appellant-accused in the manner that the eye-witness eventually described inher deposition before the trial court. Even Shri S.C. Girhotra father of Ms. Ruchika has categoricallydeposed that the appellant-accused met him and requested him not to send his daughter abroad andalso insisted to meet her in his office on 12.08.1990 which gets corroboration from the statement ofPW-13 that both the girls went to meet the appellant-accused at his office at HLTA.8) With regard to the claim of signature on the Memorandum as well as on the application given tothe SHO, learned senior counsel for the CBI submitted that as far as the signatures of Ms. Ruchikaon the document are concerned, Ms. Ruchika has signed the alleged Memorandum in the presenceof others and the same is established by the witnesses like Ms. Aradhana, Mrs. Madhu Prakash andSh. Anand Prakash in whose presence she signed the documents, which is a direct evidence. Theevidence of expert witness cannot be considered conclusive proof of the charge and it requiresindependent and reliable evidence for its corroboration. She further submitted that Ms. Ruchika wasthe best person to depose about the genuineness of her signatures, but as she is no more, therefore,she could not appear in the witness box to depose about the genuineness of her signature on thealleged Memorandum. In her absence, the persons, in whose presence, she signed the document arethe best witnesses to prove the genuineness of the signature of the victim. The strong direct evidenceon record cannot be rebutted by weak type of evidence of hand writing expert upon which reliance isplaced by the learned senior counsel on behalf of the appellant-accused.9) With regard to the contention urged by the appellant-accused that Ms. Aradhana was the SathiKhiladi as mentioned in the Memorandum, on the basis of which FIR got registered, wasmanipulated, learned senior counsel submitted that a perusal of the contents of the Memorandumreveals that it merely gives a sequence of events which had happened from the very beginning andno manipulation appears to be made out. Merely on the ground that Shri C.P. Bansal, the then DIGand Shri Sham Lal Goyal, the then DSP were present on the spot, it cannot be said that they activelyparticipated in its drafting and certain unnecessary and unwarranted facts were added to it. Ifexperienced police officers would have participated in its drafting then it should have been in theform of FIR and the evidence must have been specifically pointed out in it. But the language of theMemorandum is like that the people have tried to show their resentment against the alleged act anddemanded action against the accused. The reason for not mentioning the name of Ms. Aradhana inthe Memorandum is that she could have been harassed by the accused, who being a high rankingpolice officer. Because of this reason only, Ms. Ruchika or Ms. Aradhana or their parents did notapproach the local police to lodge the FIR. They were fully aware that the appellant-accused, being asenior most police officer, holding a key post in the State, would definitely hamper the investigationor may not allow the police officers to cooperate with the complainant party.S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/610) Learned senior counsel for the CBI further pointed out that Shri R.R. Singh was an authoritylegally competent to investigate the facts of the Memorandum and he was asked by the Governmentof Haryana to enquire into the facts given in the Memorandum and to submit a report to it. To makea person an authority legally competent to investigate, it is not necessary that he should be havingauthority which flows from a Statute. It is sufficient that such person was authorized legally by theState Government to investigate the fact. As such, Sh. R.R. Singh was competent authority toinvestigate the facts in question and the statements given by the witnesses before him are admissiblein evidence irrespective of time gap between the time when the incidents occurred and the date onwhich the statements were given.11) Learned senior counsel for the CBI finally submitted that the alleged rivalry between the HLTAand HTA as well as the arguments advanced by learned senior counsel for the appellant-accusedregarding the credibility of Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1) and Shri S.C. Girhotra (PW-15) have nobearing on the case at hand and the prosecution has made out a case for conviction of theappellant-accused under Section 354 of the IPC.Discussion:12) It is not disputed that HLTA was floated in 1988-89 at Panchkula, Haryana. Theappellant-accused was the President of HLTA. Its office was established in the garage of an underconstruction house at Sector 6, Panchkula owned by the appellant-accused. It is also an admittedfact that Ms. Aradhana (PW-13), Mr. Manish Arora (PW-3), Mr. Vipul Chanana (PW-4) and Ms.Ruchika (since deceased) were the members of the Association and used to play tennis in its court. Itis the case of the prosecution that on 11.08.1990, the appellant-accused visited the house of Shri S.C.Girhotra (PW-15) and requested him not to send his daughter to Canada for coaching as he wouldarrange special coaching for her at HLTA itself. This fact has been well proved by Shri S.C. Girhotra(PW-15) in his statement. He has deposed before the trial Court that on 11.08.1990, theappellant-accused visited his house at about 12.00 noon and had asked him not to send his daughterto Canada and that he would arrange special coaching for her. The appellant-accused further askedhim to send his daughter on 12.08.1990, at about 12.00 noon, in his office to discuss about thetraining. At that particular point of time, Ms. Ruchika was not present at her house. On her return,PW-15 informed the same to her and also asked her to meet the appellant-accused on 12.08.1990 inhis office at 12.00 noon. This fact finds corroboration from the statement of Ms. Aradhana (PW-13).She has deposed that on 12.08.1990, at about 11.00 a.m., Ms. Ruchika came to her house and shevery excitedly told her that on 11.08.1990, the appellant- accused had visited her house andrequested her father not to send her abroad and that he would arrange special coaching for her atHLTA itself as she was a promising player. She further informed Ms. Aradhana that theappellant-accused had asked her to meet him on 12.08.1990, at 12.00 noon, at HLTA office. Thevery same fact finds place in the Memorandum also which was signed by Ms. Ruchika along withothers. The evidence of PW-15 corroborates with the evidence of PW-13 in order to substantiate thefact that the appellant-accused visited the house of Shri S.C. Girhotra on 11.08.1990 and asked himto send Ms. Ruchika to his office on 12.08.1990, at 12.00 noon.S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/713) Ms. Ruchika (since deceased) and Ms. Aradhana went to play at lawn tennis court on 12.08.1990and while they were playing Sh. Paltoo-the ball picker came there and told Ms. Ruchika that theappellant-accused had called her to his office at 12.00 noon. Accordingly, Ms. Ruchika and Ms.Aradhana went to his office. The appellant-accused asked Ms. Aradhana to fetch the coach-Shri T.Thomas. While Ms. Aradhana had left the place, the appellant-accused molested/outraged themodesty of Ms. Ruchika. When Ms. Aradhana returned to the office, she witnessed theappellant-accused molesting Ms. Ruchika. Ms. Aradhana, in her statement, has categoricallydeposed that on that day when both of them i.e., Ms. Ruchika and Ms. Aradhana were playingtennis, Shri Paltoo, the ball picker, came and informed Ms. Ruchika that the appellant-accused hadcalled her in HLTA office. They saw that the appellant-accused was standing outside his office. Onseeing them, the appellant-accused asked them to come to his office. Though Ms. Ruchika requestedthe appellant-accused to talk to her outside the office, but he insisted them to come to his office. Onhis insistence, they followed him towards his office. On being asked by the appellant-accused, achair was brought on which Ms. Aradhana (PW-13) sat down while Ruchika remained standing onher right side. Immediately thereafter, the appellant-accused asked Ms. Aradhana to fetch thecoach-Mr. T. Thomas. When she went outside to call the coach, she found him standing at a distanceon the other side of the house across the road. She asked the ball picker-Paltoo to go and fetch thecoach. Mr. Thomas, on being informed about the same by Mr. Paltoo, waved his hand towards Ms.Aradhana expressing his inability to come at that moment. Thereafter, Ms. Aradhana returned andwhen she entered the office, she saw that the appellant- accused was holding one hand of Ms.Ruchika and his other hand was around her waist. Ms. Ruchika was trying hard to get herselfreleased by pushing him away with her other hand. On seeing Ms. Aradhana (PW-13), theappellant-accused became nervous and released Ms. Ruchika and fell down on his chair. When sheinformed the appellant-accused that coach has refused to come to his office, the appellant-accusedrudely ordered her to go again and call the coach personally. In the meantime, Ms. Ruchika came toher side and went out of the office. When PW-13 was trying to follow her, the appellant-accused toldher ask her to cool down, I will do whatever she will say. Thereafter, PW-13 followed Ms. Ruchikaand when she reached near her, Ruchika started weeping loudly. When she asked Ms. Ruchika as towhat had happened, she narrated that as soon as she left to fetch the coach, the appellant-accusedcaught hold of her hand which she got released with great difficulty, but he again caught hold of herhand and with his other hand the appellant-accused caught hold of her waist and dragged hertowards him and embraced her. She further told her that in the meantime when PW-13 reachedthere, he got scared and immediately released her. After discussion as to whether the incident bedisclosed to their parents or not, both of them decided not to inform their parents about the incidentas the appellant-accused, being a high ranking police officer, could harm their families. Themolestation of Ms. Ruchika, at the hands of the appellant-accused is very well proved from thedeposition of PW-13. There was no reason for Ms. Aradhana (PW-13) to depose falsely. In fact, shewitnessed the actual act of molestation of Ms. Ruchika at the hands of the appellant-accused.Further, the fact regarding molestation of Ms. Ruchika by the appellant-accused has been stated onoath by Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1), Mrs. Madhu Prakash (PW-2), Mr. Manish Arora (PW-3), Mr. Vipul Chanan (PW-4) and Shri S.C.Girhotra (PW-15). There is no reason as to why PW-13 and other aforementioned prosecutionwitnesses would falsely implicate the appellant-accused in the case.S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/814) Ms. Ruchika and Ms. Aradhana visited the lawn tennis court on 14.08.1990, at 4:30 p.m.,instead of their usual timing deliberately in order to avoid confrontation with the appellant-accused,who usually used to visit the court in the evening daily. At about 6.30 p.m., when they were about toreturn after practice, Shri Paltoo the ball picker, came over the lawn tennis court and told Ms.Ruchika that the appellant-accused had called her in his office immediately. However, Ms. Ruchikarefused to go there and told Ms. Aradhana that since they had not informed about the incidentwhich took place on 12.08.1990 to their parents that has emboldened the appellant-accused.Thereupon, they decided to inform about the overt act of the appellant-accused to their parents.They went to the house of Ms. Ruchika where they met Shri S.C. Girhotra - father of Ms. Ruchika.Ms. Ruchika started narrating the incident of molestation to her father, however, she could notnarrate the entire incident and broke down, whereupon her father told Ms. Aradhana to take Ms.Ruchika to her mother. They went to the house of Ms. Aradhana where Mrs. Madhu Prakash (PW-2)and Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1) were present. Ms. Ruchika disclosed the entire incident to PW-2,who further informed her husband about the said incident. Thereafter, Ms. Ruchika, Ms. Aradhana,Shri Anand Prakash, Mrs. Madhu Prakash and Shri S.C. Girhotra and other persons went to HLTAcourt to meet the appellant-accused wherefrom they came to know that the appellant- accused hadalready left for Chandigarh.15) On 15.08.1990, a number of persons, who were mostly players and their parents, gathered at theresidence of Shri Anand Prakash. They decided that the incident should be brought to the notice ofhigher authorities including the Chief Minister of Haryana. Accordingly, a Memorandum wasprepared. A number of copies of this Memorandum were prepared for being handed over todifferent authorities. This Memorandum was signed by Sh. Anand Prakash, Ms. Ruchika, Mrs.Madhu Prakash, Meenu, Sangeet, Aradhana, Anirudh, Beenu, Naresh Mittal, C.S. Gupta and ShriI.D. Mittal. The witnesses who were examined in the court identified their signatures as well assignatures of Ms. Ruchika on the Memorandum. The appellant-accused disputed the genuineness ofsignatures of Ms. Ruchika. He tried to substantiate his contention by examining the hand writingexpert. The contention of the appellant-accused is not tenable as the witnesses who have beenexamined by the prosecution and in whose presence the Memorandum was signed, have identifiedthe signatures of Ms. Ruchika. Shri Anand Prakash has proved the preparation of Memorandum. Inthis regard, the law is very clear that a fact should be proved by the best available evidence. Thewitnesses had identified the signatures of Ms. Ruchika on the Memorandum, therefore, the evidenceof the hand writing expert cannot considered to be safe and it requires corroboration fromindependent witnesses. As already stated, the signatures of Ms. Ruchika have been proved by thewitnesses who have signed the Memorandum and are direct, primary and best available evidence inthe case and, therefore, the same can be relied upon.16) On 16.08.1990, the Memorandum was given to Shri J.K. Duggal (PW-12), the then Secretary(Home) who assured them that the matter would be enquired into. He asked the persons who hadpresented the Memorandum to him to reach the lawn tennis court where Shri S.K. Joshi, the thenSDM would also be reaching. After reaching there, they found a Notice dated 15.08.1990 declaringsuspension of Ms. Ruchika with effect from 13.08.1990 displayed on the Notice Board. Shri S.K.Joshi, the then SDM also reached there. Shri Kuldeep Singh-the Manager and Shri T. Thomas-theCoach were also present there. On being asked, Shri Kuldeep Singh, in the presence of witnesses,S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/9informed that he has affixed the notice on the directions of the appellant-accused. He furtherdisclosed that Ms. Ruchika has committed no act of indiscipline. On being asked, Shri KuldeepSingh gave the same facts in writing on the Notice. This fact was confirmed by the Coach - Shri T.Thomas and he signed at a point where the following words were written I support the contents ofthe endorsement of Sh. Kuldeep Singh. He was also asked to give it in writing, if any act ofindiscipline has been committed by Ms. Ruchika. On this, he made an endorsement to the effect thatto the best of his knowledge Ms. Ruchika has not done any act of misbehavior or indiscipline in theHLTA tennis court. This notice was produced by Shri Anand Prakash at the time of his depositionbefore the trial court. It has also come in his evidence that said notice was given to him by the SDMimmediately after making endorsement. These facts have been proved by PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4,PW-5 and PW-13. The presence of Shri Kuldeep Singh and Shri T. Thomas on that day and time hasalready been proved by the then SHO, Panchkula who was on patrolling duty on that date andreached the spot on receiving verbal transmission message about the incident.17) Shri R.R. Singh was directed by the Chief Minister and Home Minister of the State of Haryana toconduct an enquiry into the allegations contained in the Memorandum. In compliance of the saidorder, Shri R.R. Singh recorded the statements of the witnesses including Mrs. Madhu Prakash(PW-2), Ms. Aradhana (PW-13), Shri S.C. Girhotra (PW-15) and Shri Anil Kumar. The statements ofMs. Ruchika and Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1) were also recorded. After the enquiry, herecommended that a case under the relevant provisions of the IPC be got registered. Despite the factthat Shri R.R. Singh had recommended the registration of a case against the appellant-accused, noaction was taken by the State Government. It is most surprising that no value was attached to thesaid Report and to the recommendations made by such a high ranking police officer i.e., DirectorGeneral of Police, Haryana.18) It has also been argued from the side of the appellant-accused that Shri B.S. Ojha and Shri J.K.Duggal were having great grudge against him. It was further contended that the relations betweenthe appellant-accused and Shri R.R. Singh were strained since 1976. But this suggestion was deniedby the witness while appearing in the court. Learned senior counsel for the CBI has strenuouslysubmitted that a proper report was given by Shri R.R. Singh and it is a matter of commonexperience that no girl or father would make a false complaint of such heinous nature even againsttheir enemy.19) Shri R.R. Singh had conducted the enquiry under the orders of the Government of Haryana,therefore, he was competent to investigate/enquire into the allegations made in the Memorandum.As such, all the statements recorded by him are admissible under Section 157 of the Indian EvidenceAct for the purpose of corroboration. Shri J.K. Duggal and Shri B.S. Ojha are independent witnessesand they have no grudge against the appellant-accused as alleged by the learned senior counsel. Forthe sake of arguments, even if it is assumed to be correct that there was some dispute over thecontrol of HLTA between them, it was not such a big issue which would have induced them toimplicate the appellant-accused falsely. There is no evidence on record to substantiate theallegations that these two officers were in any way instrumental in preparation of Memorandum orimplicating the appellant- accused in the case. There is also no evidence on record to suggest anynexus of these two officers with Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1) and Shri S.C. Girhotra (PW-15). There isS.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/10no evidence to suggest any enmity between the appellant-accused and PW-1 to implicate him in afabricated case. It is further the case of the appellant-accused that statement recorded by Shri R.R.Singh cannot be used by the prosecution for the purpose of corroboration under Section 157 of theEvidence Act. The contention of the accused is not tenable at all. This section envisages twocategories of statements of witnesses, which can be used for corroboration. First is the statementmade by a witness to any person at or about the time when the incident took place. The second is thestatement made by him to any authority legally competent to investigate the matter. Suchstatements gain admissibility, no matter that it was made long after the incident. But if thestatement was made to non-authority, it loses its probative value due to lapse of time. Shri R.R.Singh was an authority legally competent to investigate the incident. He was asked by the StateGovernment to enquire into the facts given in the Memorandum and report thereon. To make aperson an authority legally competent to investigate, it is not necessary that he should be havingauthority which flows from a Statute. It is sufficient that such person was authorized legally by theState Government to investigate the matter. Hence, we are of the view that Shri R.R. Singh wasauthority competent to investigate the fact in question and the statements given by the witnessesbefore him are admissible in evidence irrespective of time gap between the time when incidentsoccurred and the date on which the statements were given. Shri R.R. Singh was in fact competent toinvestigate the matter since the enquiry conducted by him was merely a fact finding enquiry. Theundisputed fact is that nothing happened even after the submission of the report by Shri R.R. Singhbecause no action was taken by the State Government on the same. Further, all the witnessesincluding Sh. J.K. Duggal and Shri B.S. Ojha examined by the prosecution are the independentwitnesses and the enmity, as suggested by the appellant- accused, is not proved, as discussed above.20) Learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused has contended that in the present factsituation, how a person can embrace other while standing behind the table and then suddenly fallinto his chair on the entry of PW-13. In this regard, we have carefully considered the evidence givenby the prosecution, especially the evidence of PW-13. She, being the sole witness to prove the actusreus, her evidence should receive some careful consideration and we do not find any reason for herto depose falsely against the appellant-accused. There is, thus, every possibility that Ms. Ruchikacould have been embraced by the appellant in the manner as described by PW-13.21) The High Court, on proper re-appreciation of the entire evidence, came to the right conclusionthat the prosecution was successful in proving the case beyond reasonable doubt and the offencepunishable under Section 354 of the IPC was made out. There is devastating increase in casesrelating to crime against women in the world and our country is also no exception to it. Although thestatutory provisions provide strict penal action against such offenders, it is for the courts toultimately decide whether such incident has occurred or not. The courts should be more cautious inappreciating the evidence and the accused should not be left scot-free merely on flimsy grounds. Bythe consistent evidence of Ms. Aradhana (PW-13), the prosecution has proved beyond reasonabledoubt the offence committed by the appellant under Section 354 of the IPC. A charge under Section354 of the IPC is one which is very easy to make and is very difficult to rebut. It is not that onaccount of alleged enmity between the appellant and Shri Duggal and Shri Ojha, he was falselyimplicated. It would, however, be unusual in a conservative society that a woman would be used as apawn to wreak vengeance. When a plea is taken by the appellant- accused that he has been falselyS.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/11implicated, courts have a duty to make deeper scrutiny of the evidence and decide the acceptabilityor otherwise of the accusations made against him. In the instant case, both the trial court and theHigh Court have done that. There is no scope for taking a different view from the view already beentaken by the courts below. The occurrence of the overt act is well proved by the unimpeachabletestimony of the eye-witness Ms. Aradhana (PW-13).22) In order to constitute the offence under Section 354 of the IPC, mere knowledge that themodesty of a woman is likely to be outraged is sufficient without any deliberate intention of havingsuch outrage alone for its object. There is no abstract conception of modesty that can apply to allcases. A careful approach has to be adopted by the court while dealing with a case alleging outrage ofmodesty. The essential ingredients of the offence under Section 354 IPC are as under:(i) that the person assaulted must be a woman;(ii) that the accused must have used criminal force on her; and(iii) that the criminal force must have been used on the woman intending thereby to outrage hermodesty.23) This Court, in Vidyadharan vs. State of Kerala (2004) 1 SCC 215, held as under 10. Intention isnot the sole criterion of the offence punishable under Section 354 IPC, and it can be committed by aperson assaulting or using criminal force to any woman, if he knows that by such act the modesty ofthe woman is likely to be affected. Knowledge and intention are essentially things of the mind andcannot be demonstrated like physical objects. The existence of intention or knowledge has to beculled out from various circumstances in which and upon whom the alleged offence is alleged tohave been committed. A victim of molestation and indignation is in the same position as an injuredwitness and her testimony should receive the same weight ..24) It is undoubtedly correct that if intention or knowledge is one of the ingredients of any offence,it has got to be proved like other ingredients for convicting a person. But, it is also equally true thatthose ingredients being state of mind may not be proved by direct evidence and may have to beinferred from the attending circumstances of a given case. The sequence of events which we havedetailed earlier indicates that the appellant-accused had the requisite culpable intention.25) This Court, in Tarkeshwar Sahu vs. State of Bihar, (2006) 8 SCC 560, held as under:-39. So far as the offence under Section 354 IPC is concerned, intention to outrage the modesty of awoman or knowledge that the act of the accused would result in outraging her modesty is thegravamen of the offence.40. The essence of a womans modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux ofthe matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive.Modesty is an attribute associated with female human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attachesto a female owing to her sex.S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/1226) With regard to the delay of about 6 days in presenting the complaint to the SHO, this Court is ofthe view that the same has been duly explained. In a tradition-bound non-permissive society inIndia, it would be extremely reluctant to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect uponchastity of a woman had occurred, being conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the societyor being looked down by the society. In the instant case, the victim-Ms. Ruchika not informingabout the incident to the parents under the circumstances that the appellant- accused, who being avery senior police officer of the State, was reasonable and it would not have been an easy decisionfor her to speak out. In the normal course of human conduct, this unmarried minor girl, would notlike to give publicity to the traumatic experience she has undergone and felt terribly embarrassed inrelation to the incident to narrate it to her parents and others overpowered by a feeling of shameand her natural inclination would be to avoid talking about it to anyone, lest the family name andhonour is brought into controversy. After informing the incident to her parents, the follow up actionwas immediately taken by the residents and the fellow players and a Memorandum containingallegations against the appellant-accused was prepared and submitted before the then Secretary(Home). Therefore, giving a due consideration to the appellant- accused, once the victim and herfamily members got assurance of justice from the superior authorities, they lodged a formalcomplaint against the appellant-accused.27) With regard to the contention of learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused that thesignature of Ms. Ruchika on the Memorandum was forged though she signed the same in front ofShri Anand Prakash, Shri S.C. Girhotra, Ms. Aradhana and Mrs. Madhu Prakash and they haveadmitted the same, we are of the opinion that expert evidence as to handwriting is only opinionevidence and it can never be conclusive. Acting on the evidence of any expert, it is usually to see ifthat evidence is corroborated either by clear, direct or circumstantial evidence. The sole evidence ofa handwriting expert is not normally sufficient for recording a definite finding about the writingbeing of a certain person or not. A court is competent to compare the disputed writing of a personwith others which are admitted or proved to be his writings. It may not be safe for a court to record afinding about a persons writing in a certain document merely on the basis of expert comparison, buta court can itself compare the writings in order to appreciate properly the other evidence producedbefore it in that regard. The opinion of a handwriting expert is also relevant in view of Section 45 ofthe Evidence Act, but that too is not conclusive. It has also been held by this Court in a catena ofcases that the sole evidence of a handwriting expert is not normally sufficient for recording a definitefinding about the writing being of a certain person or not. It follows that it is not essential that thehandwriting expert must be examined in a case to prove or disprove the disputed writing. It isopinion evidence and it can rarely, if ever, take the place of substantive evidence. Before acting onsuch evidence, it is usual to see if it is corroborated either by clear, direct evidence or bycircumstantial evidence.28) In Mobarik Ali Ahmed vs. The State of Bombay AIR 1957 SC 857, this Court has held as under:-11..Learned counsel objected to this approach on a question of proof. We are, however, unable to seeany objection. The proof of the genuineness of a document is proof of the authorship of thedocument and is proof of a fact like that of any other fact. The evidence relating thereto may bedirect or circumstantial. It may consist of direct evidence of a person who saw the document beingS.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/13written or the signature being affixed. It may be proof of the handwriting of the contents, or of thesignature, by one of the modes provided in Sections 45 and 47 of the Indian Evidence Act. It mayalso be proved by internal evidence afforded by the contents of the document. This last mode ofproof by the contents may be of considerable value where the disputed document purports to be alink in a chain of correspondence, some links in which are proved to the satisfaction of the court. Insuch a situation the person who is the recipient of the document, be it either a letter or a telegram,would be in a reasonably good position both with reference to his prior knowledge of the writing orthe signature of the alleged sender limited though it may be, as also his knowledge of the subjectmatter of the chain of correspondence, to speak to its authorship. In an appropriate case the courtmay also be in a position to judge whether the document constitutes a genuine link in the chain ofcorrespondence and thus to determine its authorship. We are unable, therefore, to say that theapproach adopted by the courts below in arriving at the conclusion that the letters are genuine isopen to any serious legal objection. The question, if any, can only be as to the adequacy of thematerial on which the conclusion as to the genuineness of the letters is arrived at. That however is amatter which we cannot permit to be canvassed before us.29) In Smt. Bhagwan Kaur vs. Shri Maharaj Krishan Sharma And Others (1973) 4 SCC 46, this Courtheld as under:-26..It is no doubt true that the prosecution led evidence of handwriting expert to show the similarityof handwriting between (PW 1/A) and other admitted writings of the deceased, but in this respect,we are of the opinion that in view of the main essential features of the case, not much value can beattached to the expert evidence. The evidence of a handwriting expert, unlike that of a fingerprintexpert, is generally of a frail character and its fallibilities have been quite often noticed The courtsshould, therefore, be wary to give too much weight to the evidence of handwriting expert. In Sri SriSri Kishore Chandra Singh Deo v. Babu Ganesh Prasad Bhagat this Court observed that conclusionsbased upon mere comparison of handwriting must at best be indecisive and yield to the positiveevidence in the case.30) It is thus clear that uncorroborated evidence of a hand writing expert is an extremely weak typeof evidence and the same should not be relied upon either for the conviction or for acquittal. Thecourts, should, therefore, be wary to give too much weight to the evidence of handwriting expert. Itcan rarely, if ever, take the place of substantive evidence. Before acting on such evidence, it is usualto see if it is corroborated either by clear, direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence.31) It is the claim of learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused that the present case isfabricated and a result of the rivalry between HLTA and HTA. Further, Shri Anand Prakash hasderived professional benefit from this exercise besides venting his longstanding grudge against theappellant-accused. It does not stand to logic that having regard to the Indian social set up, anyfather would let his daughters honour and reputation be damaged merely because one of hisassociate has his own agenda against the appellant-accused. However, each case has to bedetermined on the touchstone of the factual matrix thereof. In the instant case, there is nothing onrecord on the basis of which it can be said that the tender age of the victim was exploited for thebenefit of Shri Anand Prakash (PW-1)S.P.S.Rathore vs C.B.I & Anr on 23 September, 2016Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30822518/1432) With regard to the contention of learned senior counsel that non- examination of two importantsite witnesses viz., Shri Paltoo-the ball picker and Shri T.Thomas-the Coach draws adverse inferenceagainst the prosecution, the High Court has rightly held that adverse inference against theprosecution can be drawn only if it withholds certain evidence and not merely on account of itsfailure to obtain certain evidence. We are also of the opinion that they were not in any wayconnected with the actual commission of offence and even in their absence, the commission of theoffence of molestation by the appellant-accused stands well proved by the unimpeachable testimonyof the eye witness (PW-13) to the incident.33) No particular number of witnesses is required for proving a certain fact. It is the quality and notthe quantity of the witnesses that matters. Evidence is weighed and not counted. Evidence of even asingle eye witness, truthful, consistent and inspiring confidence is sufficient for maintainingconviction. It is not necessary that all those persons who were present at the spot must be examinedby the prosecution in order to prove the guilt of the accused. Having examined all the witnesses,even if other persons present nearby not examined, the evidence of eye-witness cannot be discarded.34) In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the opinion that Ms. Aradhana (PW-13) withstoodher testimony from beginning till the end and her deposition was found reliable and corroborativewith other prosecution witnesses and both the courts below were right in upholding the convictionof the appellant-accused under Section 354 of the IPC.35) With regard to sentence of the appellant-accused, learned senior counsel on his behalf haspointed out certain mitigating factors which are- old age of the appellant-accused, health ailments, responsibility of looking after the unmarrieddaughter suffering from congenital heart disease, past meritorious service and prolonged trial.Keeping in view the aforementioned factors especially the old age and physical condition of theappellant-accused, we do not think it expedient to put him back in jail. While we uphold the findingsas to the guilt of the appellant-accused, we are of the opinion that the cause of justice would be bestsub-served when the sentence of the appellant-accused would be altered to the period alreadyundergone. We, therefore, reduce the sentence of the appellant to the period already undergone byhim as a special case considering his very advanced age.36) In view of the foregoing discussion, we confirm the conviction of the appellant-accused underSection 354 of the IPC while modifying the sentence to the period already undergone. The appeal isdisposed of with the above terms.....J.(V. GOPALA GOWDA) ......J.(R.K.
