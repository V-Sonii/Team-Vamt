The respondent challengedhis  conviction in appeal to the High Court. The High  Courtset  aside the order of conviction and sentence  imposed  bythe  trial  court and acquitted him. The State  feeling  ag-grieved  came up in appeal by special leave. While  allowingthe  appeal  setting aside the order of the High  Court  andState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/1restoring that of the Trial Court, the Court,    HELD:  A prosecutrix of a sex-offence cannot be  put  onpar  with  an  accomplice. She is in fact a  victim  of  thecrime.  The  Evidence  Act nowhere says  that  her  evidencecannot  be  accepted unless it is corroborated  in  materialparticulars.  She is undoubtedly a competent  witness  undersection 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight asis attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. Thesame degree of care and caution must attache in the  evalua-tion of her evidence as in the case of any injured complain-ant or witness and no more. [123B-C]    What  is more necessary is that the Court must be  aliveto  and  conscious of the fact that it is dealing  with  theevidence  of  a person who is interested in the  outcome  ofcharge levelled by her. Having regard to the increase in thenumber  of sex-violation cases in the recent past,  particu-larly cases of molestation and rape in custody, it is properto remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony  ofa woman who is a116victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated inmaterial  particulars  except in the rarest of  rare  cases.[123C-D; 124B-C]    Ours is a conservative society where it concerns  sexualbehaviour.  Ours is not a permissive society as in  some  ofthe Western and European countries. Our standard of  decencyand  morality  in public life is not the same  as  in  thosecountries.  It  is, however, unfortunate  that  respect  forwomanhood  in  our country is on the decline  and  cases  ofmolestation  and rape are steadily growing. An Indian  Womanis  now required to suffer indignities in  different  forms,from  lewd remark to eve-teasing, from molestation to  rape.Decency  and  morality in public life can  be  promoted  andprotected  only if we deal strictly with those  who  violatethe  social norms. The standard of proof to be  expected  bythe Court in such cases must take into account the tact thatsuch  crimes  are generally committed on the  sly  and  veryrarely  direct evidence of a person other than the  prosecu-trix is available. [124D-F]    Courts  must also realise that ordinarily a woman,  moreso a young girl, will not stake her reputation by leveling afalse  charge concerning her chastity. By our criminal  lawsvide  powers are conferred on police officers  investigatingcognizable  offences.  The infrastructure  of  our  criminal'investigation  system  recognises and indeed  protects  theright  of a woman to decent and dignified treatment  at  thehands of the investigating agency. [124F-H]    The  purpose and setting, the person and  his  position,the misuse or abuse of office and the despair of the  victimwhich  led to her surrender are all relevant  factors  whichmust  be present in the mind of the Court  while  evaluatingthe conduct-evidence of the prosecutrix. A person in author-ity,  such as a police officer carries with him the  awe  ofState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/2office  which  is bound to condition the  behaviour  of  hisvictim [125C-D]    The Court must not be oblivious of the emotional turmoiland  the psychological injury that a prosecutrix suffers  onbeing  molested or raped. She suffers a tremendous sense  ofshame and the fear of being shunned by society and her  nearrelatives  including  her husband. Instead of  treating  herwith  compassion and understanding as one who is an  injuredvictim of a crime, she is, more often than not, treated as asinner  and shunned. It must, therefore be realised  that  awoman who is subjected to sex-violence would always be  slowand  hesitant about disclosing her plight. The  Court  must,therefore, evaluate her evidence in the above background.117Bharwada  Bhognibhai  Hirjibhai  v.  State  of  Gujarat,[1983] 3 SCR 280--relied upon.JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 221 of 1986 etc. From the Judgmentand Order dated 28.6.1985 of the Bombay High Court in Crl. Appeal No. 215 of 1982. S.B. Bhasme,Mrs. H. Wahi, A.S. Bhasme and A.M. Khanwil- kar for the Appellants.V.D. Misra, J. Wad and Mrs. Aruna Matbur for the Re- spondents.The Judgment of.the Court was delivered by AHMADI, J. This appeal by special leave is brought bythe State of Maharashtra against the judgment of acquittal recorded by the Nagpur Bench of theHigh Court of Bombay (Maharashtra) reversing the conviction of the respondent ChandraprakashKewalchand Jain, a Sub-Inspector of Police, under Section 376, I.P.C. for having committed rape onShamimbanu, a girl aged about 19 or 20 years on 22nd August, 1981. The learned AdditionalSessions Judge, Nagpur, came to the conclusion that the prosecution had brought home the chargeunder Section 376, I.P.C. and sentenced the respond- ent to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6 months. He was,however, acquitted of the charge under Section 342, I.P.C. The respondent challenged his convictionin appeal to the High Court. The High Court set aside the order of conviction and sentence imposedby the trial court and acquitted the respondent. The State feeling aggrieved sought special leave toappeal. On the same being granted this appeal is before us.Briefly the facts are that the parents of Shamimbanu were residing as tenants in a part of thebuilding belonging to the father of Mohmad Shafi while the remaining portion was occupied by theowner's family. PW 1 Mohmad Shafi aged about 25 years fell in love with PW 2 Shamimbanu agedabout 19 years. The prosecution case is that although the parents of both knew about their loveaffair, for some reason or the other, they were not married. Both of them left Nagpur and went toBombay where they contracted a marriage through a Kazi and returned to Nagpur by train on 20thAugust, 198 1. They got down at Anjani Railway Station (a suburb of Nagpur) and went to a nearbyGurudeo Lodge and occupied Room No. 204. That night i.e. on the night of 20th/12st August, 1981,State Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/3PW 8 Police Sub Inspector Qureishi checked the hotel and learnt that the couple was living in thesaid room in the assumed names of Mohmad Shabbir and Sultana. On being questioned PW 1Mohmad Shafi gave out the true facts and showed the Nikahnama. Ex. 10. On being satis- fied aboutthe correctness of the version, Police Sub-In- spector qureishi got their correct names substituted inthe register of the Lodge as is evident from the entry Ex. 31, proved by PW 5 Manohar Dhote, theManager of the Lodge. Police Sub-Inspector Qureishi did not deem it necessary to take any stepsagainst the couple.On the next night between 21st and 22nd August, 1981 the respondent-accused went to the hotelroom No. 204 occupied by the couple at the odd time of about 2.30 a.m. and knocked on the door.He was accompanied by PW 7 Constable Chandrab- han. When Mohmad Shafi opened the door therespondent ques- tioned him on seeing Shamimbanu with him. Mohmad Shafi told him that she washis wife and gave their correct names. Notwithstanding their replies the respondent insisted thatthey accompany him to the police station. PW 5 requested the respondent to sign his visit book sincehe had inspected a few rooms of his Lodge including Room No. 204 but the re- spondent told himthat he would do it later. So saying he left the Lodge with the couple.On reaching the police station the respondent separated the couple. He took Shamimbanu to thefirst floor of the police station while her husband Mohmad Shafi was taken to another room by PW7. Shamimbanu alleges that after she was taken to the first floor, the respondent flirted with her,slapped her when she refused to respond to his flirtation and demanded that she spend the nightwith him. The respond- ent also demanded that she should give her age as 15 years so that MohmadShafi could be booked. On her refusing and protesting against his behaviour he threatened her withdire consequences.In the other room Mohmad Shafi was subjected to beating by PW 7. After sometime both the boyand the girl were brought down to the main hall of the police station. By then it was around 5.00 or5.30 a.m. Thereafter he sent Mohmad Shafi with a constable to fetch the girl's father. The girl'sparents arrived at the police station shortly. The respondent asked the girl's parents if they wereprepared to take back the girl who claimed to have married Mohmad Shafi. The girl's parentsshowed annoyance and left the police station refusing to take her with them. Mohmad Shafi'sparents also adopted the same attitude.The respondent then recorded an offence under Section 110 read with 117 of the Bombay Police Actagainst Mohmad Shafi on the allegation that he was found misbehaving on a public street utteringfilthy abuses in front of Gujarat Lodge near Gurudeo Lodge. After putting Mohmad Shaft in thelock-up he sent the girl Shamimbanu to Anand Mahal Hotel with PW 7. Initially PW 4, the HotelManager refused to give a room to an unescorted girl but PW 7 told him that he had brought her onthe directive of the respondent. Thereupon PW 4 allotted Room No. 36 to her. He made an entry inthe hotel register to the effect 'Shamimbanu wife of Mohmad Shaft ..... as per instructions of PoliceSub-Inspector Shri Jain ...... ' vide Ex. 25. Afterleaving the girl in Room No. 36, PW 7 left the hotel.It is the prosecution case that after the girl was allotted the room, as per the usual practice, the hotelboy changed the bed-sheets, pillow covers and quilt cover. The rent was charged from the girl.Having thus separated the couple and finding the girl thoroughly helpless, the respondent visitedState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/4the girl's room and knocked on the door. The unsuspecting Shamimbanu opened the door. Therespondent entered the room and shut the door behind him. Thereafter he asked the girl to undressbut on the girl refusing he forcibly removed her 'kurta' and threw it away. He gagged the girl'smouth and threatened her with dire consequences if she did not submit. He then threw the girl onthe cot, forcibly removed her 'salwar' and denuded her. He then had sexual intercourse with her,notwithstand- ing her protestations. After satisfying his lust, the re- spondent left threatening thathe would bury both of them alive if she complained to anyone. He told her that he would nowarrange to send back her husband.Not fully satisfied the respondent returned to the hotel room after about half an hour and knockedon the door. Shamimbanu opened the door thinking that her husband had returned. When she sawthe respondent she tried to shut the door but the respondent forced his way into the room and shutthe door from within. He once again had sexual inter- course with her against her will. He repeatedhis threat before leaving.On the other hand Mohmad Shaft was sent to Court on his arrest under Sections 110/117 of theBombay Police Act. He was released on bail. He returned to the police station by about 5.00 p.m.and enquired about the whereabouts of his wife. PW 7 told him she was in Room No. 36 of AnandMahal Hotel. He immediately went to his wife. On seeing him she was in tears. She narrated to himwhat she had gone through at the hands of the respondent. Enraged Mohmad Shaft went back to thepolice station and informed PW 14 Inspector Pathak about the commission of assault and rape onhis wife by the re- spondent. PW 14 recorded the same in the station diary at 6.35 p.m. and informedhis superiors about the same presuma- bly because a police officer was involved. Thereupon DeputyCommissioner of Police Parassis and Assistant Commissioner of Police Gupta arrived at the policestation. The Assistant Commissioner of Police asked Inspector Pathak to accompany Mohmad Shafiand fetch Shamimbanu. On their return with Shamimbanu Mohmad Shaft was asked to give awritten account of the incident which he did. On the basis thereof an of- fence under section 376,I.P.C. was registered and the investigation was entrusted to Inspector Korpe of Crime Branch.In the course of investigation a spot panchnama of Room No. 36 was drawn up and certain articlessuch as bed-sheet, quilt cover, mattress, etc. which had semen-like stains were attached. The hotelregister containing the relevant entry (Ex. 25) was also seized and statements of witnesses wererecorded. Both the respondent and Shamimbanu were sent for medical examination and their bloodsamples were taken along with that of Mohmad Shafi to determine their blood groups. Similarly thegarments of the respondent and Shamimbanu were attached and sent for chemical examinationalong with the articles seized from the hotel room. On the conclusion of the investigation therespondent was charge sheeted and put up for trial before the Additional Sessions Judge, Nagpur.The respondent pleaded not guilty to the charge and denied the accusation made against him. Hisdefence was that he arrested Mohmad Shaft on the charge under Sections 110/117, Bombay PoliceAct, and took him to Gurudeo Lodge and from there he took him and Shamimbanu to the policestation. Since the parents of both the boy and the girl disowned them he had no alternative but toplace Mohmad Shaft in the lock-up and allow Shamimbanu to leave the police station as a freecitizen since she was not accused of any crime. It was his say that after Shamimbanu left the policestation she went to Anand Mahal Hotel and stayed in Room No. 36 awaiting Mohmad Shafi.State Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/5According to him as Mohmad Shaft was annoyed because of his detention in the lock-up, he had,with the assistance of Shamimbanu, falsely involved him on the charge of rape.The trial court found that the respondent had visited Room No. 204 at an odd hour and had takenthe couple to the police station where he had misbehaved with the girl. It also found that he hadbooked the boy on a false charge and had lodged the girl in Room No. 36 after their parentsdisowned them. It lastly held that the evidence of the prosecutrix clearly established that therespondent had raped her twice in that room. The trial court convicted the respondent underSection 376, I.P.C.The respondent preferred an appeal to the High Court. A learned Single Judge of the High Courtallowed the appeal and acquitted the respondent. The High Court took the view that the oralinformation Ex. 50 furnished by Mohmad Shafi to Inspector Pathak at 6.35 p.m. constituted theFirst Information Report and the subsequent written information Ex. 7 given at 8.30 p.m., wasinadmissible in evidence as hit by Section 162 of the Code. The High Court then took the view thatexcept in the 'rarest of the rare cases' where the testimony of the prosecutrix is found to be sotrustworthy, truthful and reliable that no corroboration is necessary, the Court should ordinarilylook for corroboration. Accord- ing to it as Ex. 50 did not unfold two successive acts of rape, this wasnot a case where it would be safe to base a conviction on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, moreso because both the girl and the boy had reason to entertain a grudge against the respondent whohad booked the latter. Lastly the High Court pointed out that the version of the prosecutrix is full ofcontradictions and is not corroborat- ed by medical evidence, in that, the medical evidence re-garding the examination of the prosecutrix is negative and does not show marks of violence. Thesecontradictions and inconsistencies have been dealt with in paragraphs 24 to 31 of the judgment. TheHigh Court also noticed certain infirm- ities in the evidence of PW 1 Mohmad Shafi in paragraphs 32to 34 of its judgment. The High Court, therefore, concluded that the prosecution had miserablyfailed to prove the guilt of the accused and accordingly acquitted him. It is against this order of theHigh Court that the State has preferred this appeal by special leave.The learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the entire approach of the High Court inthe matter of appreciation of evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly PW 2, betrays totalignorance of the psychology of an Indian woman belonging to the traditional orthodox society. Hesubmitted that the prosecu- tix of this case came from an orthodox muslim family, was semi-literatehaving studied upto the VII Standard and whose parents considered it a shame to take her back totheir fold because she had eloped and married a boy of her own choice. He submitted that thestatement of law in the High Court judgment that implicit reliance cannot be placed on a prose-cutrix except in the rarest of rare cases runs counter to the law laid down by this Court in BharwadaBhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat, [1983] 3 SCR 280. He also submitted that the evidence ofthe prosecutrix has been rejected on unsustainable grounds which do not touch the substratum ofthe prosecution case and which can be at- tributed to nervousness and passage of time. According tohim this approach of the High Court has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice which this Courtmust correct in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Con- stitution. The learnedcounsel for the respondent, however, supported the High Court judgment.State Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/6It is necessary at tile outset to state what the ap- proach of the Court should be while evaluating theprosecu- tion evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex-offences. Is it essentialthat the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the Courtbasis a conviction on her testimony? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save therarest of rare the Court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of theprosecutrix? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said stat- ute 'Evidence'means and includes all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it bywitnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except thecontents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oralevidence. According to that section all per- sons are competent to testify unless the Court considersthat they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rationalanswers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, orany other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section 133 provides that heshall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a convic- tion is not illegal merelybecause it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illus- tration (b)to Section. 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the Court 'may' presume that an accom-plice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction basedsolely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration(b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars.This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). A prosecutrix of a sex-offencecannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Actnowhere says that her evidence cannot be ac- cepted unless it is corroborated in materialparticulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence mustreceive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree ofcare and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evi- dence as in the case of an injuredcomplainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to andconscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcomeof the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on theevidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporat- ed in the Evidence Actsimilar to illustration (b) to Sec- tion 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for somereason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may lookfor evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corrobo- ration required in the caseof an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of theprosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circum- stances of each case. But if aprosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a con- viction on herevidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circum-stances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strongmotive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation inaccepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of aprosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accept- ed. The degree of proof required mustnot be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exceptionhas rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: "ItState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/7is only in the rarest of rare cases if the Court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is sotrustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary."With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily theevidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is avictim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in whichcase it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance toher accusation. We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex-violationcases in the recent past, particu- larly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove thenotion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence mustordinarily be cor- roborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist oncorroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust ofanother with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult toinjury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in materialparticulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where itconcerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the Western and Europeancountries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries.It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases ofmolestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indigni- tiesin different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency andmorality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violatethe societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the Court in such cases must take intoaccount the fact that such crimes are generally commit- ted on the sly and very rarely directevidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarilya woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge con- cerningher chastity.But when such a crime is committed by a person in au- thority, e.g. a police officer, should theCourt's approach be the same as in any other case involving a private citi- zen? By our criminal lawswide powers are conferred on police officers investigating cognizable offences. The infrastructure ofour criminal investigation system recog- nises and indeed protects the right of a woman to decentand dignified treatment at the hands of the investigating agen- cy. This is evident from the provisoto sub-section (2) of Section 47 of the Code which obliges the police officer desiring to effect entry togive an opportunity to the woman in occupation to withdraw from the building. So also subsection(2) of Section 53 requires that whenever a female accused is to be medically examined suchexamination must be under the supervision of a female medical practitioner. The proviso to Section160 stipulates that whenever the presence of a woman is required as a witness the investigating offi-cer will record her statement at her own residence. These are just a few provisions which reflect theconcern of the legislature to prevent harassment and exploitation of women and preserve theirdignity. Notwithstanding this concern, if a police officer misuses his authority and power whiledealing with a young helpless girl aged about 19 or 20 years, her conduct and behaviour must bejudged in the backdrop of the situation in which she was placed. The purpose and setting, the personand his position, the misuse or abuse of Office and the despair of the victim which led to hersurrender are all relevant factors which must be present in the mind of the Court while evaluatingState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/8the con- duct-evidence of the prosecutrix. A person in authority, such as a police officer, carries withhim the awe of office which is bound to condition the behaviour of his victim. The Court must not beoblivious of the emotional turmoil and the psychological injury that a prosecutrix suffers on beingmolested or raped. She suffers a tremendous sense of shame and the fear of being shunned bysociety and her near rela- tives, including her husband. Instead of treating her with compassion andunderstanding as one who is an injured victim of a crime, she is, more often than not, treated as asinner and shunned. It must, therefore, be realised that a woman who is subjected to sex-violencewould always be slow and hesitant about disclosing her plight. The Court must, there- fore, evaluateher evidence in the above background. It is time to recall the observations of this Court made not sofar back in Bharwada Bhognibhai Hirjibhai, (supra): "In the Indian setting, refusal to act on thetestimony of a victim of sexual assaults in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult toinjury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexualmolestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief orsuspicion? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male domi- nated society. Wemust analyse the argument in support of the need for corroboration and subject it to relentless andremoreseless cross-examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opinionated, eye inthe light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussedon the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the WesternWorld which has its own social milieu, is own social mores, its own permissive values, and its owncode of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdropof the social ecology of the Western World. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on aturn-key basis and to transplate it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmos-phere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian Society, and its profile. The identities of the twoworlds are dif- ferent. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identi- cal."Proceeding further this Court said:"Without the fear of making too wide a statement, or of overstating the case, it can be said thatrarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault .......... The statement isgenerally true in the context of the urban as also rural society. It is also by and large true in thecontext of the sophisticated, not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely canone conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urbanelites. Because: (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive Socie- ty of India wouldbe extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity hadever occurred. (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the Society or beinglooked down by the Society including by her own family members, relatives, friends and neighbours.(3) She would have to brave the whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love andrespect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness beingshattered. (5) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be difficult to secure analliance with a suitable match from a respectable of an acceptable family. (6) It would almostinevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear ofbeing taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embrassed in relatingthe incident to others being over powered by a feeling of shame on account of the upbringing in atradition bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be toState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/9avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought intocontroversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the hus-band's family of a married woman would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity onaccount of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victimherself being considered to be promiscu- ous or in some way responsible for the incident regardlessof her innocence. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face thecourt, to face the cross examination by Counsel for the culprit, and the risk of being disbelieved, actsas a deterrent." We are in complete agreement with these observations. We now proceed to examineif the High Court was justi- fied in upturning the order of conviction passed by the Trial Court. TheHigh Court refused to confirm the convic- tion of the respondent as it found the evidence of theprosecutrix full of contradictions and not consistent with medical evidence as well as the findingsrecorded by the Chemical Analyst. We may first indicate the contradictions which prompted theHigh Court to look for corroboration. They are:(i) the version that the respondent had misbehaved with her in the police station and had molestedher could not be believed because she did not complain about the same to the other police officerswho were present in the police station main hall on the ground floor or to her relatives who werecalled to the police station;(ii) the conduct of the respondent in calling her par- ents and in giving them an opportunity to takeher with them does not smack of an evil mind;(iii) the evidence of the prosecutrix that the respondent was instrumental in lodging her in AnandMahal Hotel room is not supported by any evidence;(iv) the conduct of the prosecutrix in not informing and seeking assistance from the hotelmanagement after the first incident and even after the second incident of rape in the hotel room isunnatural and surprising;(v) the find of semen-stains on the 'salwar' and 'kurta' of the prosecutrix runs counter to herevidence that on both the occasions she was completely denuded before she was ravished;(vi) the absence of marks of physical violence also runs counter to her version that when she tried toraise an alarm she was slapped by the respondent;(vii) the evidence of PW 3 Dr. Vijaya and the medical report Ex. 17 do not lend corroboration to theevidence of the prosecutrix that the respondent had sexual intercourse with her notwithstanding theresistence offered by her;(viii) the report of the Assistant Chemical Analyst Ex. 71 shows that neither semen nor spermatozoawere detected from the vaginal smear and slides that were forwarded for analysis; and(ix) the evidence of PW 12 Dr. More and his report Ex. 41 shows that no physical injuries were foundon the person of the respondent to indicate that he had forcible sexual intercourse shortly before hisState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/10examination. Before we proceed to deal with these discrepancies we think it is necessary to clear theground on the question whether the prosecutrix had a sufficiently strong motive to falsely involvethe respondent and that too a police offi- cer. It is possible that she may have felt annoyed at beingdragged out of the hotel room at dead of night after they had satisfied Police Sub-Inspector Qureishithat they were legally wedded only a few hours back. PW 1 may also have felt offended at beingwrongly hooked under Sections 110/117, Bombay Police Act. The question is whether on account ofthis annoyance both PW 1 Mohmad Shaft and PW 2 Shamimbanu would be prepared to stake thereputation of the latter? As pointed out earlier ordinarily an Indian woman would be most reluctantto level false accusation of rape involving her own reputation unless she has a very strong bias orreason to do so. In the present case although the couple had reason to be annoyed with the conductof the respondent, the reason was not strong enough for Mohmad Shafi to involve his wife and soilher reputation nor for Shamimbanu to do so. An Indian woman attaches maximum impor-tance to her chastity and would not easily be a party to any move which would jeopardise herreputation and lower her in the esteem of others. There are, therefore, no such strong circumstanceswhich would make the court view her evidence with suspicion.The next question is whether the High Court was justi- fied in refusing to place reliance on herevidence in view of the discrepancies and inconsistencies indicated above. It is not in dispute thatthe respondent had taken both PW 1 and PW 2 to the police station at dead of night. At the policestation both of them were separated. She was all alone with the respondent till about 5.00 a.m. Thiswas her first encounter with the police. She must have been nervous and considerably shaken. Shemust have felt helpless as she was all alone. She must be terribly worried not only about her own fatebut also that of her husband. It is during the time she was alone with the respondent that the latteris alleged to have misbehaved with her. How could she complain to the other police officers in thepolice station about the behaviour of their colleague unless she be sure of their response? Havingseen the behaviour of one of them, how could she place confidence in others belonging to the sameclan? She may rather prefer to ignore such behaviour than speak of it to unknown persons.Ordinarily an Indian woman is ashamed to speak about such violations of her person, more so tototal strangers about whose response she is not sure. There was no point in speaking to her parentswho had disowned her. She, however, claims to have informed her husband about the same on hisreturn. The omission on the part of her husband to make a mention about the same cannot discredither. Even if we assume that she omitted to mention it, the said omission cannot weaken herevidence as obvious- ly she would attach more importance to what happened there- after in the hotelroom. The respondent's behaviour in the police station had paled into insignificance in view of hissubsequent misdeeds. No wonder she would attach greater importance to the subsequent eventsrather than dwell on advances made earlier. We, therefore, cannot agree with the High Court'sobservation that "the prosecutrix is not only prone to make improvements and exaggerations, but isalso a liar disclosing a new story altogether to serve her inter- est". This is a harsh comment which,we think, is totally unwarranted.The High Court has argued that the conduct of the respondent in sending for her parents and inpermitting her to go with them shows that the respondent's intentions were not evil. In the firstplace it must be mentioned that the suggestion to call the parents came from PW 1.State Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/11Secondly the evil thought may have taken concrete shape after the parents refused to take her withthem. It was then that the respondents realised the helplessness of the girl and chalked out a plan tosatisfy his lust. As a part of that design he falsely booked Mohmad Shaft and made arrange- mentsto lodge the girl in a hotel of his choice. The evi- dence of PW 4 Suresh Trivedi read with the entry inthe hotel register and the contradiction brought on record from his police statement leave no roomfor doubt that the girl was lodged in his hotel at the instance of the respondent. PW 6 and PW 7 havealso resiled from their earlier versions to help the respondent. But notwithstanding their denial wesee no reason to disbelieve Shamimbanu on the point of PW 7 having lodged her in Room No. 36 ofAnand Mahal Hotel as the same is corroborated not only by the remark in the entry Exh. 25 of thehotel register but also by the fact that it was PW 7 who informed Mohmad Shaft that she was inRoom No.36. We are, therefore, of the view that her evidence in this behalf is supported by not only oral butalso documentary evidence. How then could she seek help or assistance from the hotel staff whichwas under the thumb of the respondent? The hotel was situate within the jurisdiction of the re-spondent's police station. It was at the behest of the respondent that she was kept in that room. Shemust have realised the futility of complaining to them. Failure to complain to the hotel staff in theabove circumstances cannot be described as unnatural conduct.It is true that the prosecutrix had deposed that on both the occasions she was completely denudedbefore the respond- ent raped her. On the first occasion he had removed her 'kurta' before she waslaid on the cot. Her 'salwar' was removed while she was lying on the cot. Therefore, the 'salwar' maybe lying on the cot itself when the act was committed. It is, therefore, not at all surprising to findsemen stains on the 'salwar'. She was wearing the same clothes when she was ravished the secondtime. On the second occasion he first threw her on the cot and then undressed her. Therefore, boththe 'kurta' and the 'salwar' may be lying on the cot at the time of sexual intercourse. Besides she hadworn the same clothes without washing herself imme- diately after the act on each occasion. It is,therefore, quite possible that her clothes were stained with semen. It must also be remembered thatthis is not a case where the prosecuting agency can be charged of having concocted evi- dence sincethe respondent is a member of their own force. If at all the investigating agency would try to help therespondent. There is, therefore, nothing surprising that both these garments bore semen stains.Besides, there was no time or occasion to manipulate semen stains on her clothes and that too of therespondent's group. Her clothes were sent along with the other articles attached from Room No. 36for chemical analysis under the requisition Ex. 67. The report of the Assistant Chemical Analyser,Ex. 69 shows that her clothes were stained with human blood and semen. The semen found on oneof her gar- ments and on the bed sheet attached from the room was of group A which is the group ofthe respondent, vide Ex. 70. Of course the other articles, viz., the mattress and the underwear of therespondent bore no stains. On the contrary the find of semen tends corroboration, if corroborationis at all needed to the version of the prosecutrix. The possi- bility of the semen stains being ofMohmad Shaft is ruled out as his group was found to be 'B' and not 'A'. In the circumstances theabsence of semen or spermatozoa in the vaginal smear and slides, vide report Ex. 71, cannot castdoubts on the creditworthiness of the prosecutrix. The evidence of PW 3 Dr. Vijaya Lele shows thatshe had taken the vaginal smear and the slides on 23rd August, 1981 at about 1.30 p.m. i.e., almostafter 24 hours. The witness says that spermatozoa can be found if the woman is examined within 12State Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/12hours after intercourse, thereafter they may be found between 48 and 72 hours but in dead form.Shamimbanu may have washed herself by then. Therefore absence of sper- matozoa cannot discredither evidence.The absence of marks of physical violence on the prose- cutrix is not surprising. According to her therespondent had slapped her and threatened her with dire consequences when she tried to resist himon both occasions. Since she was examined almost 24 hours after the event it would be too much toexpect slap marks on her person. It is, however, true that according to PW 12 Dr. More there wereno marks of injury on the body of the respondent when he was examined on the 22nd itself at about8.45 p.m. While it is true that the version of the prosecutrix is that she had tried to resist him, itmust be realised that the respondent being a strong man was able to overpower her and take her byforce. Be- sides, he was a man in authority in police uniform. The prosecutrix was alone andhelpless. In the circumstances as pointed out earlier the resistance would be considerablydampened. But the evidence of PW 12 Dr. More who examined the respondent on the 22nd at 8.45p.m. reveals that he had noticed (i) absence of smegma around the glans penis and(ii) the frenum tortuous and edematous. indicative of the respondent having had sexual intercoursewithin the preced- ing 24 hours. However, absence of marks of violence and absence of matting ofpubic hair led the witness to state that no definite opinion could be given whether or not therespondent had sexual intercourse in the last 24 hours. In cross-examination an attempt was madeto show that smegma may be absent in a man with clean habits; that the frenum may be edematousif there is fric- tion with rough cloth and tortuousness of the frenum could be due to anything thatcauses swelling of the skin. The witness, however, said that he had not seen marks of itching therebynegativing the suggestion. Be that as it may, the evidence of this witness does show that there wasevidence suggesting the possibility of the respondent having had sexual intercourse within thepreceding 24 hours although the witness could not hazard a definite opinion. Therefore, thenon-committal opinion of this witness cannot be said to run counter to the evidence of theprosecutrix. It may be that the evidence as to resistence may have been overstated, a tendency whichis generally noticed in such cases arising out a fear of being misunderstood by the society. That isnot to say that she was in any way a consenting party. She was the victim of brute force and the lustof the respond- ent.PW 1 Mohmad Shafi's evidence is also brushed aside on account of so-called contradictions set outin paragraphs 32 to 34 of the High Court Judgment. The first reason is the non-disclosure of detailsin the first oral statement which was reduced to writing at Ex. 50. That was skeleton informa- tion.That is why the need to record a detailed version Ex. 7 was felt. Therefore, merely because thedetails are not set out in Ex. 50 it cannot be said that the prosecutrix had not narrated the details.We have treated Ex. 50 as FIR for deciding this case. The previous involvement of PW 1 in a coupleof cases is not at all relevant because the decision of the case mainly rests on his wife's evidence. Buteven Ex. 50 shows that his wife had told him that the respondent had raped her. We, therefore, donot see how the evidence of PW 1 can be said to be unacceptable.The fact that the respondent had gone to Gurudeo Lodge at an odd hour and had taken theprosecutrix and her husband to the police station at dead of night is not disputed. The fact that theState Of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain on 18 January, 1990Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199575/13respondent refused to sign the police visit book of the Lodge, though requested by the Manager PW5 Manohar Dhote, on the pretext that he was in a hurry and would sign it later, which he never did,speaks for itself. Then the respondent booked Md. Shafi under a false charge and put him behind thebars thereby isolating the prosecu- trix. We say that the charge was false not merely because it is sofound on evidence but also because of the report Ex. 46 dated 21st September, 1981 seekingwithdrawal of prosecu- tion for want of material to sustain the charge. Having successfully isolatedthe prosecutrix he sent her to Anand Mahal Hotel with PW 7 who lodged her in Room No. 36. Therespondent, therefore, had planned the whole thing to satisfy his lust. The subsequent attempt onthe part of the respondent to commit suicide on being prosecuted as evidenced by the FIR Ex. 56betrays a guilty conscience. We are, therefore, of the opinion that if the prosecution evidence isappreciated in the correct perspective, which we are afraid the High Court failed to do, there can beno hesitation in concluding that the prosecution has succeeded in proving the respond- ent's guilt.Unfortunately the High Court stigmatised the prosecutrix on a thoroughly erroneous appreciation ofher evidence hereby adding to her woes. If the two views were reasonably possible we would haverefrained from interfering with the High Court's order of acquittal. In our opinion the trial court hadadopted a correct approach and had properly evaluated the evidence and the High Court was notjustified in interfering with the trial court's order of conviction. On the question of sentence we canonly say that when a person in uniform commits such a serious crime of rape on a young girl in herlate teens, there is no room for sympathy or pity. The punishment must in such cases be exemplary.We, therefore, do not think we would be justified in reducing the sentence awarded by the trial courtwhich is not harsh. In the result we allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Courtacquitting the respondent and restore the order of conviction and sentence passed on therespondent by the trial court. The respondent will surrender forthwith and serve out his sentencesin accordance with law. His bail bond will thereupon stand cancelled.Criminal Appeal No. 220 of 1986.In view of the order passed in the State's appeal, we need not pass separate orders in this appeal.The appeal will, therefore, stand disposed of in view of the order passed in the above appeal.R.N.J.
