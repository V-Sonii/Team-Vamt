COLABAWALLA, J                                  ]1                  By this Appeal, the Appellant (Original Petitioner -husband before the Family Court) has challenged the judgment and decree dated 24th August, 2015passed by the Family Court, Mumbai at Bandra. By this judgment, the Petition of the Appellant fordivorce on the ground of cruelty under section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 wasdismissed and the Appellant was directed to pay maintenance for the child @ Rs. 15,000/- perAswale 1/54 fca.20.16.doc month from the date of filing of the Written Statement by the Respondent- wife before the Family Court. The relief of injunction claimed by the Appellant - husband was alsorejected by the Trial Court. It is being aggrieved by this judgment and decree of the Family Courtthat the present Appeal has been filed. 2 The brief facts giving rise to the present Appeal are asunder:-The Appellant herein was the Original Petitioner- husband before the Family Court. TheRespondent herein was the Original Respondent-wife before the Family Court. The marriagebetween the Appellant and the Respondent was solemnized on 5 th December, 2006 at the CricketClub of India Lawns, Churchgate, Mumbai. It is not in dispute that the marriage between theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/1Petitioner and the Respondent is registered. Prior to marriage, the Appellant was a bachelor and theRespondent was the spinster. Out of the said marriage, the Appellant and the Respondent have ason named Kairav born on 25 th December, 2007. It is an admitted fact that the said son resideswith the Respondent.Aswale                                   2/54                                                            fca.20.16.doc3                  It is the case of the Appellant that after marriage, theAppellant and the Respondent cohabited and resided with the Appellant's parents at their residencesituated at 64, Ameeta building, Gen. Jagannath Bhonsle Marg, Mumbai- 400 021. Thereafter, on1st September, 2007, the Appellant took up a flat on leave and licence basis situated at 193/25,Omkar Co-operative Housing Society, sector 16A, Nerul, Navi Mumbai 400 706 and started toreside in the said premises.4 It is the case of the Appellant that initially he had filed Petition bearing No. A-2342 of 2007 fordivorce against Respondent on the ground that the same was null and void. However, after filing ofthe said Petition, several events transpired and the Respondent has filed various false cases againstthe Appellant, his parents and brother ruining and maligning their name in the society. It is the caseof the Appellant that the Respondent went to the extent of wrongfully filing cases of molestationagainst the Appellant's brother and thereby ruining his chances of pursuing an honorable professionand a decent living. It is in these circumstances that the present Petition came Aswale 3/54fca.20.16.doc to be filed against the Respondent seeking divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty. We must mention that Petition bearing No.A-2342 of 2007 has been withdrawn.5 It is the case of the Appellant that he first met the Respondent on 1st May, 2006 in a meetingarranged by one Raman Agarwal. At that particular moment of time, the Appellant's mother wassuffering from Cancer and was under going treatment for the same. At that time, when the Appellantand the Respondent met in the presence of Mr. Agarwal, it was impressed upon the Appellant thatthe Respondent was a well educated, caring and loving person, kind hearted and had a very goodsense of humour. It was further represented to the Appellant that the Respondent belonged to a verycultured and highly respected family and the Respondent's father was a businessman having atexturing plant at Silvassa. It was further represented that the Respondent was very good natured,calm and cultured and that she could completely take care of the household duties as a housewife.Aswale                                   4/54Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/2                                                            fca.20.16.doc6                  It is thereafter stated that the Appellant informed theRespondent that his earnings per month were not more than Rs. 20,000/- per month and also thathis mother is a cancer patient and needed attention. It is the case of the Appellant that theRespondent and her parents assured the Appellant that the Respondent would adjust to the salary ofthe Appellant as well as live in harmony with the Appellant's parents.7 In these circumstances, on 10th May, 2006, an engagement ceremony was performed finalizingthe marriage proposal between the Appellant and the Respondent. The ceremony was attended byclose relatives of both parties. It is the case of the Appellant that he and his father amply made itclear that the Appellant's mother, being gravely sick, the marriage ceremony would be performedonly after her chemotherapy treatment was finished. However, disregarding the Appellant's pleasand the poor health of the Appellant's mother, Mr. Raman Agarwal as well as the Respondent'sfather time and again started pressurizing the Appellant's parents and also the Appellant's grandfather for fixing an early date for the marriage.Aswale                                          5/54                                                      fca.20.16.doc8                  It is also the case of the Appellant that prior tomarriage, the Appellant expressed his desire to the Respondent that he would like to visit theRespondent's home and meet her family, to which the Respondent flatly refused saying that as pertheir custom the groom does not visit the bride's house before marriage. Hence, the Appellant wasnot allowed to meet the Respondent in her own house prior to the marriage. It is the case of theAppellant that all this while, from the month of May 2006 till October 2006, the Respondent'sfather kept harassing the Appellant's father for an early marriage. It was therefore finally agreed thatthe marriage between the Appellant and the Respondent was to be solemnized on 5 th December,2006 at the Cricket Club of India in the morning and that is how the marriage was solemnized.9 It is the case of the Appellant that before the reception of the marriage, the Respondent threwtemper tantrums causing inordinate delay in reaching the venue. Be that as it may, after marriage,Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/3the Appellant and the Respondent went for their honeymoon to Singapore. There the Respondentwould disappear on her own without prior intimation to the Appellant as a result of Aswale 6/54fca.20.16.doc which the Appellant would suffer severe trauma and harassment and get worried forthe Respondent's safety in an unfamiliar place. The Appellant has spent most of his time looking forthe Respondent and worrying about her whereabouts. The Appellant was petrified of theRespondent's irrational and irresponsible behaviour. It is thereafter averred that after marriage theAppellant realized that the Respondent always spoke about her friends and relatives in a demeaningmanner and ridiculed them. When the Appellant asked the Respondent as to why she has developedsuch a nature of ridiculing her family and friends, the Respondent surprised the Appellant with heranswer that they were not her friends but were bees on her money. According to the Appellant, theRespondent used derogatory terms for everyone, including her own family members. Initially, theAppellant believed the Respondent's stories. However, with passing of time the Appellant realizedthat all that the Respondent said were either lies or statements twisted to suit her own convenience.10 In the Petition before the Family Court great details have been set out about the cruelty that hasbeen meted out to the Appellant by the Respondent. We, in this Appeal are not going into Aswale7/54 fca.20.16.doc great detail about each and every incident save and except the major ones thathave been canvassed before us by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant.11 Considering the submissions made by both counsel and perusing the papers and proceedings,following points arise for our consideration:-I Whether the Appellants prove that the In the Respondent had treated him with cruelty affirmative.as averred in the Petition?II Whether the Appellant has made out a case In the for dissolution of their marriage whichaffirmative. was solemnized on 5th December, 2006 by decree of divorce under Section 13 (1) (ia) ofthe Hindu Marriage Act, 1955?III Whether the Appellant has made out a case Partly, Yes for setting aside the impugned judgmentand decree dated 24th August, 2015 passed by Family Court No.3, Mumbai in Petition No. A-134 of2009?12 The first incident that was brought to our notice is an incident that took place on 9th August,2007 when the Respondent strongly hit the Appellant's mother in her stomach with her elbowAswale 8/54 fca.20.16.doc knowing fully well that the Appellant's mother was suffering from breastcancer and that during an operation the Appellant's mother's abdominal muscles were removed andtransplanted around the chest along with the fat and fascia and there were no nerves on the left sideof the abdomen and therefore she did not feel any pain immediately. However, a week later the paingradually increased.13 The second incident is the incident that took place on 25th August, 2007 wherein the Respondentonce again assaulted the Appellant's mother and as a result of which she developed complicationsand was hospitalized.Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/414 The third incident is an incident that occurred on 10 th August, 2007 when the Respondentslapped the Appellant as an argument ensued between them. For this incident, the Appellant in factfiled N. C. No. 1133 of 2007 on 26th August, 2007. 15 The fourth incident is an incident that tookplace on 18th November, 2007 wherein the Respondent filed a police complaint with the GoregaonPolice Station against the Appellant Aswale 9/54 fca.20.16.doc and his family members with respectto dowry and physical assault on her.16 Thereafter, on 19th November, 2007, the Respondent filed another complaint against theAppellant and his parents at Cuffe Parade Police Station before attacking the Appellant's parents'house at Ameeta building (the fifth incident). In this complaint it was alleged that the Respondentwas prevented from getting into house that was admittedly owned by the parents of the Appellant.After this complaint was filed, on the very same day, i.e. on 19th November, 2007 the Respondentalong with some other persons attacked the Appellant's father and mother at Ameeta building anddamaged the Appellant's father's premises. Accordingly, a complaint was filed by the Appellant'sfather against the Respondent and her family and friends with DCP, Colaba.17 Thereafter, it is alleged that on 28th November, 2007, the Respondent filed Petition B-113 of2007 in the Family Court demanding the Appellant's father's property. This Petition was dismissedby the Family Court. It is thereafter stated that on 5 th April, 2008 and 5th May, 2008, theAppellant's father was Aswale 10/54 fca.20.16.doc assaulted by the Respondent's father and hisassociates for which the Appellant's father lodged a complaint and filed a criminal caseNo.64/SW/08 in the Metropolitan Magistrate Court at Esplanade. On 21st April, 2008 theRespondent's family and others filed criminal Revision Petition No.765 of 2008 before the SessionsCourt, Mumbai to quash the said case which was rejected on 20 th September, 2008. This order waschallenged by filing a Writ Petition in this Court wherein this Court gave partial relief and directedthat the case in the Magistrate's Court be tried in a time bound manner. We must mention here thatthis criminal complaint was ultimately withdrawn by the Appellant's father on the basis of anagreement that was arrived at between the parties vide a Memorandum of Understanding dated 25th July, 2013. It appears that though the Appellant's father acted on the basis of the said MOU, theRespondent and her family members have failed to keep up to their end of the bargain under thesaid MOU. 18 Be that as it may, another incident that occurred was on 15th July, 2008 when an NCcame to be filed by the Respondent in MRA Police Station for which the Appellant and his fatherwere detained for six hours and finally freed on proving to the police the false nature of the said NC.This NC is numbered as NC No.932 Aswale 11/54 fca.20.16.doc dated 15th July, 2008. We mustmention here that there is no dispute that this incident has taken place. However, it was arguedbefore us that the Respondent is unaware whether the Appellant and his father were detained for sixhours.19 Thereafter, on 18th July, 2008 a criminal complaint of molestation was filed against theAppellant's younger brother - Dr.Deepesh and others at Nirmal Nagar Police Station bearing FIRNo. 171 of 2008. According to the Appellant, at that relevant time, the Appellant and his entirefamily was in the Sessions Court for hearing of an Anticipatory Bail Application. In this veryproceeding, the Respondent also filed a criminal appeal in the High Court for getting furtherinvestigation done on the production of some CCTV footage from the security of the High Court andMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/5her said Appeal was allowed by this Court and the police were directed to do further investigation.Thereafter, further investigations were done and the police filed their report dated 22 nd February,2014 wherein it has been opined that no substantial proof is received to the effect that the CCTVfootage being claimed by the Respondent was procured by them from the CCTV recording room ofthe High Court and the person visible in the footage is the same person which is accused in the casefiled by the Respondent Aswale 12/54 fca.20.16.doc herein. We will refer to this report in greaterdetail later in this judgment. Be that as it may, this complaint filed against the brother of theAppellant was finally disposed of by order dated 16th July, 2016 when the Appellant's brother hadfiled an application for discharge under Section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Crpc).By this order, the Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, after hearing both the parties, allowed theapplication and discharged the Appellant's brother vide Section 239 of the CrPC for offencespunishable under Sections 341, 323, 504, 354 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (for short"IPC"). 20 What is important to note is that in this order, the court has recorded that apart from thecomplaint being lodged after some delay and for which there was no explanation, the Complainant(namely the Respondent herein) was not able to provide the description of any of the aforesaid threeunknown persons (who allegedly acted on the behest of the Appellant's brother - Dr. Deepesh) eitherin her FIR or in her further statement. The court further noted that the Complainant had notproduced her clothing, which were allegedly torn off by the so called three unknown persons tosubstantiate her allegations. Further, the Complainant had not disclosed the number of the Aswale13/54 fca.20.16.doc rickshaw nor had she stated that one of the assailants was accompanied by theAppellant's brother in motor car no. 9800. Further, the police report sets out the statement of thecomplainant that three unknown persons allegedly assaulted the Complainant and she sustainedinjuries. However, no medical certificate was also filed to prove the injuries on the person of theComplainant. It is in these circumstances that the Metropolitan Magistrate's Court observed that theAppellant's brother is the sole person against whom the police has submitted the charge sheet forcommission of the alleged offences. It was an admitted fact that the assault had not taken place bythe Appellant's brother, but on his instructions, by three unknown persons. Considering that thosethree unknown persons were never identified nor arrested nor arrayed by her in the FIR, theMetropolitan Magistrate's Court observed that the provisions of Section 34 of IPC were inapplicableagainst the Appellant's brother (the accused). The Appellant's brother was not liable to beprosecuted for sharing a common intention with the so called three unknown persons especiallywhen the Police had never arrested any other person or submitted a police report against any of theso called unknown persons. The Court further opined that Aswale 14/54 fca.20.16.doc theInvestigating Officer had not collected any evidence to show that there was any direct or indirectinvolvement of the accused (Appellant's brother) to commit the offences punishable under Sections341, 323, 504, 354 read with 34 of the IPC. It is in these circumstances that the Court observed thatthere is no evidence on record to frame the charge against the Appellant's brother (accused) andhence an order was passed allowing the application of the Appellant's brother and he wasdischarged of the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 504, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC. 21Considering all these incidents and many more, on 13th January, 2009, the Appellant filed PetitionNo. A-134 of 2009 in the Family Court seeking a divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In this Petition, on 19th October, 2010, the Respondentmoved an application for maintenance. This application was allowed by the Family Court vide itsorder dated 17th June, 2013 granting maintenance of Rs.10,000/- p. m. for the child and Rs.Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/630,000/- p. m. for the Respondent.22                 After filing of this Petition, another complaint was filedAswale                                    15/54                                                     fca.20.16.docon 20th December, 2011 by the Respondent against the Appellant's brother - Deepesh in MRA MargPolice Station wherein it was alleged that the Appellant's brother had threatened that he wouldkidnap the child of the Respondent.23 It is the case of the Appellant that on 24 th January, 2014 the Family Court ordered arrestwarrant against the Appellant in RD No. 213 of 2011 despite the Appellant having made the fullpayment by 10th May, 2013. Despite full payment being made, the Respondent did not withdraw RDNo. 213 of 2011 and requested for arrest behind the back of the Appellant. As far as this incident isconcerned, the Appellant was released on his personal surety with a warning. The Appellant wassubjected to confinement for the whole day and humiliated, at the hands of the Respondent, is theallegation.24 On 25th November, 2014, the Respondent again moved an application seeking arrest of theAppellant in RD NO. 583 of 2013, despite the order dated 15 th November, 2014 passed by one of us(K. K. Tated, J.) having granted relief by staying the said Family Court proceedings till 12thDecember, 2014. Despite the stay order of this Court, the Appellant was initially arrested andAswale 16/54 fca.20.16.doc thereafter released in view of the fact that this court had already stayedthe Family Court proceedings as mentioned earlier. 25 Looking to all these incidents, and asnarrated above, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, submitted that there wasno real dispute that these incidents actually took place. There have been several criminal complaintsfiled by the Appellant and his family members against the Respondent and her family members andvice versa. She submitted that looking to all these incidents and certainly when looked at as a whole,a clear case of cruelty was made out by the Appellant. She submitted that some of these incidentshave not even been discussed by the Trial Court in the impugned order. They have been completelyignored. Furthermore, according to the learned counsel, the Trial Court had gone completely wrongin taking each incident in isolation rather than looking at all the incidents as a whole and thencoming to the conclusion whether there was a case of cruelty made out or otherwise. She also tookus through the evidence led by the parties in respect of these incidents and submitted that this was aMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/7fit case where a decree of divorce ought to have been granted under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the HinduMarriage Act, 1955 and the impugned order ought to be Aswale 17/54 fca.20.16.doc set aside, atleast to the extent of not granting a divorce in favour of the Appellant.26 On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, submitted thatthe Trial Court had correctly appreciated the evidence led by the parties and has thereafter come tothe conclusion that no case for divorce on the ground of cruelty has been made out by the Appellant.The Trial Court has examined each individual incident and thereafter come to the conclusion that ithas. The learned counsel painstakingly took us through the impugned order and the reasoning giventherein. He therefore submitted that there was absolutely no justification for interference with theimpugned order which was well reasoned and passed on sound legal principles. Accordingly, hesubmitted that there was no merit in this Appeal and the same ought to be dismissed.27 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and have perused the papers andproceedings in the present Appeal.28                 At the outset, we must mention here that a detailedAswale                                  18/54                                                      fca.20.16.docWritten Statement was filed by the Respondent to the Petition filed by the Appellant which can befound from pages 190 to 208 of the paper book. We have carefully gone through this WrittenStatement wherein the Respondent herself alleges several acts of cruelty that have been allegedlymeted out to her and her family members by the Appellant and his family members. In fact, on thisbasis, an issue also was framed whether the Respondent proved that the Appellant had treated herwith cruelty as averred in her Written Statement. This issue however was not at all decided by theTrial Court on the ground that the same was not necessary to decide the same since the Respondenthad not made any claim based on the alleged cruelty and that by itself would not discharge theAppellant from proving cruelty pleaded by him. 29 Having said this, we shall now deal with theincidents of cruelty that were pleaded by the Appellant and examine the same on the basis of thepleadings and the evidence led by the parties in that regard.CRIMINAL COMPLAINT FILED BY THE RESPONDENTMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/8AGAINST     THE APPELLANT'S  BROTHER   FORMOLESTION:-Aswale                                     19/54                                                               fca.20.16.doc30                 The first incident and which according to us is one ofthe most important incidents of cruelty alleged by the Appellant is the criminal complaint filed on18th July, 2008 by the Respondent against the Appellant's younger brother - Dr. Deepesh on theground that the Respondent was molested by three unknown persons on the instructions/behest ofthe said Dr. Deepesh. In this regard, an FIR came to be filed bearing FIR No. 171 of 2008. This FIRcan be found at pages 84-88 of the Respondent's compilation Exhibit-76. On the basis of the FIRCriminal Case no.2277/PS/2008 was filed in the Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at Bandra.31 As far as this incident is concerned, the averments of the Appellant can be found at paragraph"oo" of the Appeal (page 179 of the paper book). The Appellant has stated that on 18 th July, 2008the Respondent filed a case against the Appellant's brother falsely alleging that with the help ofthree goons the Appellant's brother tore her clothing and threatened her to divorce the Appellant. Itis thereafter stated that this complaint of the Respondent is totally false as the Appellant's brother(Dr. Deepesh) was with the Appellant at the Sessions Court for filing an Aswale 20/54 fca.20.16.docapplication for Anticipatory bail. In reply to the Respondent's FIR, a detail statement was filed at theNirmal Nagar Police Station, explaining the facts. It is thereafter stated that despite this, theAppellant's brother was arrested and then released on bail and told to report the Police Station everySunday like a criminal. 32 As far as this incident is concerned, the Appellant has led evidence inchief wherein what has been stated by the Appellant in his Divorce Petition has been reiterated inhis evidence. Even in the cross examination of the Appellant he has categorically denied the incidentof 18 th July, 2008 and has stated that the Appellant and his brother had applied for AnticipatoryBail and it was not true to say that the Appellant and his brother, with the help of local goons hastried to pressurize the Respondent into divorcing the Appellant by molesting her. Apart from theAppellant being examined himself, the Appellant also examined his mother. The Appellant's motherin her evidence has stated that on 18th July, 2008, the Respondent filed a false molestation caseagainst her son Deepesh (Appellant's brother). She has categorically stated that the time mentionedin the complaint made by the Respondent, her son Dr. Deepesh was with her at the Aswale 21/54fca.20.16.doc Sessions Court. What is interesting to note is that there is no cross examination of theAppellant's mother on this at all. The next witness that has been examined by the Appellant, isAppellant's father (PW-6). He, at paragraph 19 of his affidavit, has stated that on 18th July, 2008,the Respondent filed an FIR against his younger son Deepesh falsely alleging that Deepesh, with theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/9help of three goons, tore her clothes and threatened her to give divorce to the Appellant. TheAppellant has further stated that the said complaint is clearly false as his son Deepesh was with himat the Sessions Court for filing an application for Anticipatory Bail. He has further stated that thisFIR has been investigated and re- investigated and the allegations of the Respondent in this regardhave been proved false in the police report. We must state that even the Appellant's father has notbeen cross-examined with reference to this incident.33 The only pleading that we find of the Respondent with reference to this incident is in paragraph42 of her Written Statement (page 203 of the paper book). All that the Respondent has stated in herpleading is that on 18 th July, 2008 she had come to meet her advocate in the Family Court fordiscussion with her Aswale 22/54 fca.20.16.doc brother and father and whilst returning she wasalone. It is thereafter stated that the Appellant took advantage of the same and the Respondent washumiliated/molested on the road. Accordingly, the Respondent's complaint came to be filed whichare self explanatory.34 What is interesting to note from these pleadings is that in the Written Statement the Respondentalleges that the Appellant took advantage of the situation that Respondent was alone andhumiliated/molested her on the road. However, in the FIR filed about this alleged incident, theAppellant does not figure in the same anywhere. In the FIR, the allegation is that the Appellant'sbrother - Dr. Deepesh, conspiring with three unknown persons, on 18th July, 2008 had pushed theComplainant and pulled her dupatta and kicked on her private parts. The detailed police report withreference to this incident has been filed before us at page 209 of the Appellant's compilation. Thepolice report with reference to this incident clearly states that in February, 2008 the Complainant(Respondent herein) had received summons to the effect that a suit was filed against her in theFamily Court, Bandra and as the date of hearing in the said notice was 19th July, 2008, in order tofile reply to it, the Complainant Aswale 23/54 fca.20.16.doc (Respondent) had gone to meet herAdvocate Sandhya Sharma at the Family Court at Bandra, Mumbai. After meeting her advocate atabout 13.45 hours, the Respondent started to go to her residence at Goregaon by Rickshaw. On herway to the residence, near Ascension at fly over bridge, the Rickshaw suddenly broke down andtherefore the Rickshaw driver pushed the Rickshaw and brought it on the service road and informedthe Respondent that he would arrange for another Rickshaw. Thereafter, the Respondent got downat the service road and was waiting for another Rickshaw. At that time, three persons were standingthere. There were rings in the fingers of their hands. Moreover, amongst them, there was a stronglybuilt person wearing a black kurta and pajama. Another person was having a beard and was wearinga pant and a shirt. The third person's teeth were shabby and his face was dreadful. The strongly builtperson pushed the Respondent and pulled her dupatta and kicked on her private parts. Moreover,the person who was looking dreadful caught hold of her hair and the person who was sporting abeard was speaking on the phone to somebody, when he said "Doctor madam work had been done".At that time, the Respondent asked him as to who had sent him, upon which she was informed that"Doctor Aswale 24/54 fca.20.16.doc has sent us" and stated that just now they have only torn of herkurta but hereafter they will tear her nickers, if she does not sign the papers pertaining to thedivorce with the Appellant. Saying this, they left from there. After this she got a rickshaw on theservice road and while she was proceeding ahead on the service road, out of her three assailants, theRespondent saw that the person sporting a beard sitting with the accused Deepesh in a black colourMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/10car bearing No.9800 on the highway by the side of the service road. At that time the said person andDeepesh were laughing seeing the complainant (Respondent). Thereafter the Respondent went toher house at Goregaon by rickshaw and narrated the aforesaid facts to her mother. Thereafter thisinformation was also given to the Respondent's father over the phone. This information wasthereafter also given by the Respondent's father to his friend Varun Chowdhary who thereafter cameto the Respondent's house and accompanied her to Goregaon Police station and narrated all theaforesaid facts to the Senior Police Inspector there.35 What we find very interesting is that it is the Respondent's own case that the rickshaw that shehad gotten into Aswale 25/54 fca.20.16.doc to go to her residence from BKC to Goregaon brokedown on the highway. It is for this reason that the rickshaw was pushed on the service road. It is theRespondent's own statement that when the Rickshaw was pushed on the service road on the sideand was parked there, three persons (who allegedly molested her) were standing there. It is not hercase that those three people were either following her or arrived there once she was at the spotwhere the rickshaw had broken down. It is also not her case or allegation that the rickshaw driverwas in anyway involved in this incident. This being the case, it is ludicrous to suggest that her 3assailants, and who were supposedly acting at the behest of the Appellant's brother, happened to beat the exact same spot where the rickshaw broke down. The police report which has been preparedafter further investigation (as ordered by this Court in Writ Petition No.3075 of 2012 dated 26thSeptember, 2012), was also filed in the Magistrate's Court. After this report came to be filed, theAppellant's brother Dr. Deepesh filed an application under Section 239 of the CrPC for discharge inthe said Criminal Case No. 2277/PS/2009. This application for discharge came to be allowed by theMetropolitan Magistrate's Court, Bandra, Mumbai vide its order dated 16th July, 2016. This orderclearly records Aswale 26/54 fca.20.16.doc that though this incident occurred on 18 th July, 2008,the Complainant had lodged the FIR on 19 th July, 2008, and for this delay, there was noexplanation. It has been further recorded that the Respondent had not been able to providedescription of any of the aforesaid three unknown persons either in her FIR or in her furtherstatement. Further, the Respondent had not produced her clothes which were allegedly torn off bythe so called three unknown persons at the time of the alleged incident to substantiate herallegations and neither had the Respondent disclosed the number of the rickshaw in which she wastraveling. Despite the fact that it is her case that she was molested and had suffered injuries, theInvestigating Officer had not filed any medical certificate on record to prove injuries on the personof the Respondent. The chargesheet that came to be filed was against one person only namely Dr.Deepesh for the alleged offences. In this regard, the Metropolitan Court opined that the provisionsof Section 34 of the IPC were inapplicable against Dr. Deepesh. Dr. Deepesh was not liable to beprosecuted for the alleged offence for sharing a common intention with the so called three unknownpersons especially when the police had never arrested any person or submitted a police reportagainst any of the so called unknown Aswale 27/54 fca.20.16.doc persons. The Investigating Officerhad not collected any evidence to show that there was either any direct or indirect involvement ofDr. Deepesh to commit offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 504, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC. Itis in these circumstances and considering the very object of Section 239 of the CrPC, theMetropolitan Magistrate allowed the application of discharge. 36 On going through this order, wefind that the application of the Appellant was allowed after perusing the police report filed before itand the Magistrate finding absolutely no evidence whatsoever against Dr. Deepesh (namely theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/11Appellant's brother). We, therefore, find that as far as this incident is concerned, the Appellant'sbrother was wrongfully accused of molesting the Respondent. More importantly, what is alsoimportant to note is that in the evidence led by the Appellant's mother as well as the Appellant'sfather, it is their case that Dr. Deepesh at the time of the alleged incident was in the Sessions Courtwith them applying for Anticipatory Bail apprehending that the Respondent may file a complaintagainst them under Section 498A of the IPC. This evidence has not been controverted whatsoever bythe Respondent. This is another factor, which at Aswale 28/54 fca.20.16.doc least to our mind,clearly goes to show that there was no real substance in the FIR filed by the Respondent against theAppellant's brother on the alleged ground of molestation. We clearly find that this complaint filedagainst the Appellant's brother would certainly amount to cruelty as it has tarnished the image ofthe Appellant and his entire family in society and would certainly amount to cruelty as contemplatedunder Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. According to us, on this ground alone theAppellant would be entitled to a decree of divorce.37 It is crystal clear from the report submitted by the Nirmal Nagar Police Station in a molestationcase filed by the Respondent Wife that she can make false statements to gain favourable orders evenbefore the Courts. In that case she specifically made a statement that she obtained CCTV footagefrom the High Court to show that the Appellant's brother tried to pressurize her even in the HighCourt premises. The official English translated portion of the police report which reads thus showsthat the Respondent intentionally made false statement in a proceeding before the Magistrate Courthearing Case No. 2277 of 2011.Aswale                                  29/54                                                                   fca.20.16.doc"On the date 17.12.2011, he and his father had gone to the High Court alongwith the complainant forhearing into the said petition. The complainant had seen the person who had beaten her up in theaforesaid case on the date 19.7.2008, outside the High Court building with the arrested accusedDipesh. He threatened the complainant saying, "Still you have not mended up your behaviour, stillyou are coming to the Court, we will cut you and your child into pieces," and both of them left awayfrom them. When the complainant was scared. She made a complaint to M.R.A. Police Station .On the date 11.1.2012 the witness and his father and friend Linesh Nagda had gone alongwith thecomplainant to the High Court for further hearing into the aforesaid writ petition. On that day, thecomplainant saw the accused, to whom she had seen outside the High Court on the date 17.12.2011,of the aforesaid case, in the compound of the High Court. Complainant gave the said information tothe witness and father thereupon, he gave the said information to the complainant's advocateMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/12Ashokji Saraogi. The advocate asked him to check the C.C.T.V. footage of the Court. Thereupon, onthat day itself, all of them had gone to Security officer's office in the High Court and gave the saidinformation to the police who were present there and requested them (police personnel)to show theC.C.T.V. footage. "Thereupon they showed us C.C.T.V. footage, in the said footage, the complainant,on seeing a bearded person who was entering the Court premises, stated that he was the sameperson who had beaten her up on the date 19.7.2008. The beard on his face had grown up more. Hewas found to be of the age group of 40 years, having slim built and of the height about five feet 8inches and wearing white shirt and black pant on his person. From this, when the police made thesearch for the said accused person in the precincts of the High Court, but, he was not foundanywhere in the compound and around the High Court. On the date 11.1.2012, police sub-inspectorRevankar had met us in the Bombay High Court. We gave the aforesaid information even to himthereupon police sub-inspector Revankar told us, 'we will make an application to the High Courtand get C.C.T.V. footage' . Thereafter, when all of us sought a copy of the said footage from thepolice, the police said that they could not give footage to us and if we wanted the said footage thenwe should make an application to Higher Officers and should get the same. "However, we makeearnest request to him and told the gravity of the incident thereupon, he allowed us to record thesaid footage in the mobile, I downloaded the said footage in my mobile. We showed the said photos(images) to the High Court on the next date. If the bearded person from Muslim Community, towhom I saw in the C.C.T.V. footage of the Bombay High Court on the date 11.1.2012, if he comesbefore me then I can identify him." The complainant's brother Piyush Goyanka recorded hisstatement accordingly and the same has been annexed herewith.From the information given by the complainant and witness, when the enquiry was made withwitness Linesh Laherchand Nagda, who has family relation with them, he gave the information asfollows :- on the date 19.7.2008, when the complainant, after meeting her advocate of the FamilyCourt, was returning to her house at the spot, near Bandra Aswale 30/54 fca.20.16.doc Highway, herrickshaw got breakdown, thereupon rickshaw driver had taken his rickshaw aside on the serviceroad. As soon as he had taken his rickshaw aside and parked, at that moment itself, some unknownpersons caught hold of her and thrashed her and told her "Do as what Doctor says otherwise we willmake your condition more worse" and one person out of the unknown persons beating her up, toldsomeone from his mobile by making a phone call that - "Doctor madam your work has been done"thereafter, those unknown persons fled away through nearby lane there. On account of thiseventuality, the complainant got scared and remained unmoved there. At that time, she saw aroundher, when across the service road on the Highway her brother-in-law by name Dipesh Agarwalseated in the black colour car. She did not tell me as to which direction he had gone. Moreover, I donot know as to exactly which spot the aforesaid incident had occurred on the service road.Thereupon, I told them that the aforesaid incident was wrongful and that they should question therelatives of Meghna's in-laws and told them to sit together with the members of their communityand to resolve the said matter in a proper manner (amicably).Thereafter, about three days later, Piyush Navalkishore Goyanka informed that he had gonealongwith the complainant and had lodged the offence with the Nirmal Nagar Police Station.Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/13In connection with the aforesaid offence, the complainant has filed the Writ Petition in the HighCourt. On the date 11.01.2012, Navalkishore Goyanka, Piyush Goyanka and also the said witnessalongwith the complainant had gone to the High Court, Bombay for hearing of the said petition.On that day, when all of them were standing in front of Court Room No.3 in the High Court, at about12.30 in the afternoon, the complainant told them that she had seen one of the persons who werethrashing her on the service road, at Bandra on the date 19/7/2008, in the precincts (compound) ofthe Court. Thereupon, the said information was conveyed to Advocate Ashokji Saraogi of the case.Thereupon, he told us to to check the footage of C.C.T.V. in the Court. Therefore, on that day itselfall of us had gone to the office of the Security Officer and given the said information to the policepersonnel who was present there and requested him to show the footage of C.C.T.V. Thereupon,when he showed us the C.C.T.V. footage, Meghana on seeing one bearded person, who was beingseen entering the Court precincts in the said footage, stated that this was the same person who hadbeaten up her up on the date 19/7/2008. Thereupon, all of them (us) had sought a copy of thefootage to the said police, he had told us that he could not give the said footage to from and that ifwe wanted the said footage, then we should make an application to the higher (superior) officer andto get the same. However, when we made earnest request and told him the gravity of the incident, heallowed us to record the said footage on mobile, thereupon, Piyush Goyanka had down loaded thesaid footage in the mobile. Statement of the said witness has also been recorded and included in thepapers.When enquiry was made with the arrested accused Dipesh Gokulchand Agarwal, gave theinformation that since the time of marriage there has been quarrel between the complainant and hisbrother Aswale 31/54 fca.20.16.doc Deepak Gokulchand Agarwal. Therefore, the family members ofthe complainant 's parental home were harassing Deepak, parents and him in various manner andthereby they were trying to grab their movable and immovable properties. Therefore, thecomplainant's relatives have lodged many false complaints against them with different policestations. As such the aforesaid activities of the complainant and her parents were increased andtherefore, Deepak Agarwal had filed a petition in the Family Court, B.K.C., Bandra in the year 2007for granting him the order to live separately from the complainant. Therefore, complainant'srelatives filed a suit in the Court to get the property of the parents of the accused and harassed hisparents, brother Deepak and him in various ways. Moreover, as the accused had got the informationthat the complainant was thinking of filing case against his brother, mother and father and him,under Section 498(A), the accused and his parents and brother together had gone to the office of theRegistrar of Sessions Court, Mumbai with their advocate I.B. Singh, on the date 18/07/2008 atabout 12.00 noon, to make an application for getting anticipatory bail to prevent from beingarrested, if she (complainant) filed such case. (complainant) and we were there upto about 4.30 to05.00 p.m. in the evening. For hearing of the said matter we had again remained present in theSession Court on the date 19/07/2008, and in the hearing, we were granted anticipatory bail.When the accused was in the premises of Sessions Court,Mumbai on the date 18/07/2008, from12.00 to 5.00 p.m. During that period, some unknown persons had beaten up the complainant andthe said unknown person fled away, he (accused) was nearby spot, where the complainant wasbeaten up, such complaint has been lodged by the complainant and her relatives against him on theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/14date at Crime Registration Number 171/2008, under Section 341, 323, 504, 354, 34 of I.P.C. and hewas arrested. When he had given the aforesaid information to the police. Moreover, on that day, ashe was in the Sessions Court, neither he had seen or waylaid the complainant on that full day.Moreover, she was not molested or beaten up. In order to malign his character and to see that hisdoctor (medical) practice is stopped and to cause loss to him, the complainant at the instance of herrelatives lodged the aforesaid false complaint against him and he had told this fact to PSI Revankarat that time. However, as he told him that the proofs were found against him, therefore, thecharge-sheet was filed. As the Charge-sheet was filed against him without making properinvestigation and as he was innocent in the said offence, he had filed writ petition Number 1861/11in the High Court to quash and set aside the complaint. On the date of hearing in to the saidpetition, the complainant and her father and other associates were coming to the Court, though theyhad nothing to do with the same. On the date 17/12/11, the accused had gone to the High Courtalongwith his advocate. On that day, as the Hon'ble Judge had not come in the Court, withoutmaking my hearing in to the said petition, hearing of the petition was adjourned to 11/1/12 at 11.00a.m. On the date 11/01/2012, the said accused, alongwith his advocates and his assistant were aboutto go out of the Court precincts, Investigating Officer of his case Police Sub Inspector Revankar hadme him there, hence the accused greeted him 'Good Morning' and went ahead with his advocate. Athat time, Aswale 32/54 fca.20.16.doc complainant's father Navankishor Goyanka, Piyush Goyanka,Ajay Dalmia and some other persons were standing there. As soon as the Accused and his advocatewent ahead, the Complainant's brother Piyush Goyanka on seeing him said, " Let's give himbashing" and proceeded towards him (accused). When Ajay Dalmia told him (Piyush) that - "All ofus are in Court, if we do this then all of us will come in a fix" and dragged him back. "My advocate'sAssistant and I have heard the said words and seen the said act." When they (Advocate & Assistant)took him (accused) alongwith them out side the Court and from there they took the accused toBellard Pier Court. At that time he had ignored the aforesaid incident. However, as he had realisedthat complainant's associate and relatives would again hatch some conspiracy against him andwould implicate him in some case. Hence, on each date of hearing into the Writ Petition, theaccused Dipesh Agarwal used to move in and out of the Court only alongwith Advoate Sunil D'souzaand his Assistant. On the date 19/1/2012, hearing was made in his aforesaid Writ Petition anddecision was given to the effect that the points putforth by him have been kept open and that thehearing in to his case would be made in the concerned Court and there was no need to make enquiry(investigation) again and by giving such decision, the Hon'ble Court disposed of his Writ Petition.Therefore, at about 12.05 he alongwith his advocate Sunil D'souza left the High Court premises andwent to Bellard Pier.

Police Station, the complainant hasmade the complaint that on the date 20/12/2011, the accused Deepak Gokulchand Agarwal andunknown person had threatened her on the date 17/12/11 near Hutatma Chowk parking, Fort,Mumbai saying that if she uttered anything then they would see her on her child and hurled abusesand the said complaint has been lodged as Non Cognizable complaint No. 924/11 under Section 504,506 of I.P.C. There is a discrepancy about the narration of the threat and also in the information ofabout in information given by the complainant in her statement about the threating given by theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/18Accused Deepak Agarwal to her and about the threatening given to her by Aswale 36/54fca.20.16.doc the opponent as per the complaint given by her in M.R.A. Marg Police Station.Moreover, the police has stated to the the complainant and her father, brother and Linesh Nagdathat C.C.T.V. footage of the High Court could not be given to them without the written order of theSenior Police Officer.Moreover, there is a similarity in the same of the police department, the C.C.T.V. footage therecannot be given as per the order of the superiors.A discrepancy is seen in the information given by the complainant and the witnesses about the factas to when and from where the C.C.T.V. footage herein was taken. Moreover, there is no mentioningfrom which the police personnel they had obtained the said. Moreover, the statement given by thepolice constable no. 08-0955/Shankar Bhosale looking after the said work as stated that except theofficial working in the C.C.T.V. recording room of the High Court and in-charge police inspectornobody else had entered and that he had not given the said recording to anyone. Moreover, in thewritten information received from the said department, the same thing has been mentioned.Moreover, according to him on the working day, about 3000 people visit everyday to the HighCourt. Among them, there are many persons from Muslim community and bearded persons. Fromthis, it is not understood in the enquiry as to exactly from whom the C.C.T.V. footage, produced inthe Hon'ble Court by the complainant party, was acquired. From the information from thecomplainant and of the complainant party and the information given by the witnesses on her behalfmoreover from the non co-operation made by the complainant party in respect of making heradvocate of her case and her father to remain present, whose presence was utmost necessary in thematter of enquiry, no substantial proof is received to the effect that the C.C.T.V. footage, beingclaimed by the complainant party, was procured by them from the C.C.T.V. Recording room of theHigh Court and person visible in the footage is the same person, who is the accused in the case filedby her (complainant ).Therefore, this report is respectfully submitted for further necessary action or order.Yours faithfully, Sd/- (illegible) (P. V. Pitale) Assistant Police Inspector Nirmal Nagar, PoliceStation.The Senior Police Inspector, Nirmal Nagar Police Station, Mumbai.Pursuant to the Order of the Hon'ble High Court, the enquiry into the said matter has been carriedout. In the present matter, seen the statements of the Complainant, her brother and LineshLeharchand Nagda recorded during the course of enquiry made by the Assistant Police InspectorPitale with the Complainant and the witnesses who remained present on her behalf during theenquiry. It is found that there is a discrepancy between the time at which the Complainant had seenthe bearded person, in the High Court precincts as well as in the Aswale 37/54 fca.20.16.doc locationof the place as well as in the information given to her father. Further, there is a discrepancy even inthe date given by the Complainant on which she had seen the C. C. T. V. Footage in High Court andMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/19in the date given by the aforesaid witnesses on which they had seen the C. C. T. V. Footage.Moreover, there is also a discrepancy between the information given by the Complainant in herstatement about the threat given to her by the Accused Deepak Agarwal, and about the facts inrespect of the threat given to her by the opponent mentioned in the Complainant given by her in M.R. A. Marg Police Station and in the information about the said dates.In the information given in the statement given by the complainant as well as the witnesses givingevidence on her behalf, there is a similarity that the C. C. T. V. Footage of the High Court cannot begiven to them without the written permission of the Senior Police Officers.Moreover, it has not been mentioned as to from which Police personnel, the Complainant and thewitnesses obtained the said C. C. T. V. Footage. Further, in the statement given by Police ConstableB. No.08- 0955 / Shankar Bhosale working in the C. C. T. V. Recording Room in the High Court and in theinformation writing received from the said Section, it has been mentioned that save and except theofficial working in the C. C. T. V. Recording Room and the In-Charge Police Inspector, no one else ispermitted to go in the said Room. Further it is his say that around 3000 people come in the HighCourt on a working day which include many persons belonging to Muslim Community as well as thebearded persons. Therefore, during the course of enquiry, it has not been revealed as to exactly fromwhere the C. C. T. V. Footage produced by the Complainant before the Hon'ble Court, was obtainedby them. Thus, no substantial proof is found to the effect that the C. C. T. V. Footage produced bythe Complainant was obtained by them from the C. C. T. V. Control Room in High Court and thatthe person seen in the Footage is the Accused in the case filed by her. Therefore, I am agreeable tothe Report by submitted by the A P I Pitale after completion of the investigation.Hence, this Report is respectfully submitted for information and orders.Sd/- (illegible) Senior Police Inspector, Nirmal Nagar Police Station, Mumbai Outward No._______ / 2014 Date - ____ / 02/ 2014."38 What is interesting to note is that in the impugned order the Trial Court has taken note of thefact that the incident as Aswale 38/54 fca.20.16.doc on 18th July 2008 had taken place and that acriminal case with reference to the same was pending in the criminal court. The Trial Court hashowever recorded that since the case has not been decided, it is very difficult to say that theallegations made by the Respondent in that complaint are false. However, as can be seen from whatis stated by us herein above, the Appellant's brother has been discharged from the said case as therewas absolutely no evidence against him of any nature whatsoever. This being the case, we clearlyfind that the filing of the complaint by the Respondent against the Appellant's brother on the groundthat she was molested by the three unknown persons at the behest of the Appellant's brother (andfrom which case subsequently the Appellant's brother has been discharged as there was no evidencewhatsoever against him), would certainly amount to cruelty under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the HinduMarriage Act, 1955 entitling the Petitioner/ Appellant to a decree of divorce.Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/20COMPLAINT FILED BY THE RESPONDENT AGAINST THE APPELLANT'S BROTHER ON THEALLEGED GROUND OF THREATENING TO KIDNAP HER CHILD:-39 The next incident of cruelty that is alleged by the Appellant is when the Respondent on 20thDecember, 2011 filed a Aswale 39/54 fca.20.16.doc complaint against the Appellant's brotherDeepesh in the MRA Marg Police Station about the alleged threat given to her on 17 th December,2011 about kidnapping her child if she uttered anything. The said complaint was lodged as anon-cognizable Complaint No. 924 of 2011 under Sections 504, 506 of the IPC. This complaint alsocan be found in the police investigation report at page 215 of the Petitioner's compilation. Thispolice report clearly states that there is a discrepancy about the narration of the threat and also inthe information given by the Complainant/Respondent in her statement about the threat given byDeepesh to her. It appears that thereafter no further action was taken with reference to thiscomplaint. This is yet another incident where a complaint was filed against the Appellant's brotherDeepesh on the ground that he threatened to kidnap the Respondent's child. Even the police reportclearly states that there are contradictory statements made with reference to this complaint by theRespondent before the police authorities. This is yet another incident, which to our mind, wouldcertainly amount to cruelty as contemplated under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 especially when one takes into consideration that no further action was taken on this complaintby the Aswale 40/54 fca.20.16.doc investigating authorities as there appeared no substance in theallegations.40 We are mindful of the fact that this alleged incident occurred after the filing of the Petition. Butthat itself cannot be a ground for holding that the same would not amount to cruelty. It is now wellsettled by the Supreme Court in the case of Vishwanath Agrawal Vs. Sarla Vishawnath Agrawalreported in (2012) 7 SCC 288 that even incidents occurring during the pendency of the DivorcePetition can certainly be taken into consideration to come to the conclusion whether a party isentitled to a divorce on the ground of cruelty or otherwise. The relevant portion of this decisionreads thus:-"46. It is interesting to note that the respondent has deposed that it was published inthe papers that the daughter-in-law was slapped by the father-in-law and NeetaGujarathi was recovered from the house but eventually the police lodged a caseagainst the husband, the father-in-law and other relatives under Section 498-A of thePenal Code. We really fail to fathom how from this incident and some crypticevidence on record, it can be concluded that the respondent wife had established thatthe husband had an extramarital relationship with Neeta Gujarathi. That apart, in theapplication for grant of interim maintenance, she had pleaded that the husband was awomaniser and drunkard. This pleading was wholly unwarranted and, in fact,amounts to a deliberate assault on the character. Thus, we have no scintilla of doubtthat the uncalled-for allegations are bound to create mental agony and anguish in themind of the husband.Aswale                                        41/54Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/21                                                             fca.20.16.doc47. Another aspect needs to be taken note of. The respondent had made allegationabout the demand of dowry. RCC No. 133 of 1995 was instituted under Section 498-Aof the Penal Code against the husband, father-in-law and other relatives. They havebeen acquitted in that case. The said decision of acquittal has not been assailed beforethe higher forum. Hence, the allegation on this count was incorrect and untruthfuland it can unhesitatingly be stated that such an act creates mental trauma in themind of the husband as no one would like to face a criminal proceeding of this natureon baseless and untruthful allegations.48. Presently to the subsequent events. The courts below have opined that thepublication of notice in the daily Lokmat and the occurrence that took place on11-10-1995 could not be considered as the said events occurred after filing of thepetition for divorce. Thereafter, the courts below have proceeded to deal with theeffect of the said events on the assumption that they can be taken into consideration.As far as the first incident is concerned, a view has been expressed that the notice waspublished by the wife to safeguard the interests of the children, and the second onewas a reaction on the part of the wife relating to the relationship of the husband withNeeta Gujarathi.49. We have already referred to the second incident and expressed the view that thesaid incident does not establish that there was an extramarital relationship betweenNeeta and the appellant. We have referred to the said incident as we are of theconsidered opinion that the subsequent events can be taken into consideration. Inthis context, we may profitably refer to the observations made by a three-JudgeBench in A. Jayachandra [(2005) 2 SCC 22] : (SCC p. 32, para 16) "16. The matter canbe looked at from another angle. If acts subsequent to the filing of the divorcepetition can be looked into to infer condonation of the aberrations, acts subsequent tothe filing of the petition can be taken note of to show a pattern in the behaviour andconduct."50. We may also usefully refer to the observations made in Suman Kapur [(2009) 1SCC 422 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 204 :AIR 2009 SC 589] wherein the wife had made a maladroit effort to take advantage of atypographical error in the written statement and issued a notice to the husband alleging that he hadAswale 42/54 fca.20.16.doc another wife in USA. Thus, this Court has expressed the opinion that thesubsequent events can be considered."Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/22(emphasis supplied) 41 Looking to this Authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court, eventsthat have occurred during the pendency of the Divorce Petition can and should be looked into forconsidering whether a case of cruelty is made out as contemplated under section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. APPELLANT TAKEN INTO CUSTODY IN R.D.213 OF 2011 PURSUANTTO AN ORDER PASSED BY THE FAMILY COURT:-42 The next incident of cruelty which has been alleged by the Appellant is that he was taken intocustody on 24 th January, 2014 pursuant to an order passed by the Family Court in R.D. No. 213 of2011. This arrest order can be found at pages 61 to 62 of the order compilation tendered before us.What is interesting to note is that, the Appellant herein had filed Writ Petition No.10237 of 2013 inthis Court in which an application was moved on the very same day namely 24th January, 2014.This Court on the said date recorded the statement made on behalf of the Appellant herein that hehad already paid a sum of Rs.6,50,000/- and that he Aswale 43/54 fca.20.16.doc would deposit asum of Rs.3,00,000/- in the Family Court, Mumbai on 27th January, 2014 and further undertook todeposit a further sum of Rs.4,00,000/- on or before 10 th February, 2014 in the Family Court as apart of arrears of maintenance. This Court ordered that the aforesaid amounts would be depositedin the Family Court Mumbai on the aforesaid dates and further granted liberty to the Respondent towithdraw the said amount. Despite this order being passed on the same date, the same was notbrought to the notice of the Principal Judge, Family Court by the Respondent and instead shepressed for having the Appellant arrested. It is in these circumstances that the Appellant wasarrested on 24th January, 2014. It is only thereafter that the Appellant was released on his personalsurety. The Appellant was subjected to confinement for the whole day and humiliated at the handsof the Respondent, despite the High Court passing the order dated 24th January, 2014 granting timeto the Appellant to pay the arrears of maintenance as stated herein above. 43 This however does notstop here. On 25 th November, 2014 once again the Respondent moved an application seeking arrestof the Appellant in R.D. No. 583 of 2013. This is despite the Aswale 44/54 fca.20.16.doc fact that anorder was passed on 15th November, 2014 by this Court granting a stay of the Family Courtproceedings till 12 th December, 2014. This order of the High Court dated 15 th November, 2014 waspassed in the presence of the advocates for the Respondent. Despite this, the same was not broughtto the notice of the Family Court and instead an application for arrest of the Appellant was made on25th November, 2014. On this application filed on 25th November, 2014, the Family Court issued anarrest warrant against the Appellant. It is only at 4.45 p.m. when the order of the High Court wasbrought to the notice of the Family Court by the Appellant's advocate, that the warrant issuedagainst the Appellant was stayed. Both these incidents clearly go to show that the Respondent wasout to harass the Appellant by having him arrested time and again without bringing the true andcorrect facts before the Family Court and subverting the process of law and justice. This, to ourmind, would certainly amount to cruelty as contemplated under section 13(1)(ia) of the HinduMarriage Act, 1955 entitling the Appellant to a decree of divorce. FILING OF N.C.932 BY THERESPONDENT UNDER WHICH THE APPELLANT AND HIS FATHER WERE DETAINED FORSIX HOURS:-Aswale                                     45/54Mr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/23                                                     fca.20.16.doc44                 Another incident of cruelty that is alleged by theAppellant is one of 15th July, 2008 when the Respondent filed N.C. No.932 in the MRA PoliceStation for which the Appellant and his father were detained for six hours and finally released afterproving the false nature of the N.C. The fact that this N.C. was filed is not in dispute and in fact hasbeen produced by the Respondent themselves in their compilation. It appears that no further actionhas been taken on this N.C. and despite this we find that there is absolutely no discussion about thisincident in the impugned order. To our mind, this is one more incident which goes to show that theRespondent was out to harass the Respondent by filing frivolous complaints and having himdetained and/or arrested.THE RESPONDENT ASSAULTING THE MOTHER OF THE APPELLANT ON 9 TH AUGUST 2007AND 25 TH AUGUST 2007:-45 One more incident that we would like to narrate is one that took place on 9th August, 2007 and25th August, 2007. The allegation is that on 9th August, 2007, the Respondent hit the Appellant'smother in her abdomen with her elbow knowing fully well that her mother in law was suffering frombreast cancer and Aswale 46/54 fca.20.16.doc the abdomen muscles were removed and transplantedaround the chest along with the fat and fascia and there were no nerve on the left side of theabdomen. However, as the days passed she felt abdominal discomfort. On 25th August, 2007, againthe Respondent assaulted the Appellant's mother as a result she developed complications and washospitalized. The allegation is that it was found that the hit was in the pancreas and pancreas weredamaged. The Appellant's complaint with reference to this incident also came to be filed by theAppellant on 17 th September, 2007. Though this complaint has been filed after quite some delay,the same has been explained by the Appellant in his affidavit in lieu of evidence at paragraph 28thereof. It has been stated that on 26th August, 2007 an N.C. was registered with the Cuffe ParadePolice Station for abuse done by the Respondent to the Appellant on 10th August, 2007 and againon 14th August, 2007. This incident was related to the Respondent slapping and abusing theAppellant. At that time the Inspector was informed about the physical assault on the Appellant'smother at the hands of the Respondent. It was informed that a written complaint was required to begiven and therefore the police authorities avoided to file a complaint. Due to the Appellant'smother's critical Aswale 47/54 fca.20.16.doc condition in the hospital, a written complaint was filedon 17 th September, 2007. According to the Appellant, the police officer on the duty was persistentlyavoiding to file the complaint with reference to the abuse on his mother. Even the NC filed by theAppellant on 26th August, 2007 was registered after a week of the complaint filed by the Appellant.46 As far as the incident regarding the assault on the mother of the Appellant is concerned, thepleadings in this regard can be found at page 173 of the paper book. Even in his examination inchief, the aforesaid incident is narrated at paragraph 27 thereof. The only cross on this issue of theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/24Appellant can be found at page 242 of the paper book (paragraph82). In the cross examination the Appellant has stated that his mother was at home between 9thAugust, 2007 and 24th August, 2007. He has categorically denied that he has made any falseallegation about the Respondent assaulting his mother. He has further denied that he and hisparents conspired to throw the Respondent out of their house after taking her jewelry.47                 Apart from the evidence of the Appellant, the motherAswale                                       48/54                                                     fca.20.16.docof the Appellant has also led evidence and narrated the incident in her evidence. At paragraphs 7and 8 of her examination in chief (page 251 of the paper book), she has categorically stated that on9th August, 2007 when she called the Respondent for tea in the evening, she was hit by theRespondent with her elbow in her abdomen and chest knowing fully well that she was suffering frombreast cancer and that during the operation, her abdominal muscles were removed and transplantedaround the chest along with the fat and fascia due to which there was no sensation on the left side ofher abdomen. In these circumstances, she could not feel any pain at that particular time. However,as the days passed, she gradually felt increasing abdominal discomfort. It is thereafter specificallystated that on 25th August, 2007, the Respondent again assaulted her. On that very night hercondition deteriorated and her husband took her to the hospital where she was admitted. Onevaluation it was found that she had acute pancreatitis which according to her, was due to theRespondent's assault. She has also stated that she has been in the hospital for 14 to 15 days fightingfor her life but with the grace of God she survived. The only cross of the mother we find is atparagraphs 22 and 23 at pages 264 to 265 of the paper book. On going Aswale 49/54 fca.20.16.docthrough the cross, we do not find anything therein that shatters the testimony of the Appellant'smother. The Appellant's mother has categorically denied that she has falsely deposed that theRespondent assaulted her on 9th August, 2007 or 25th August, 2007. In fact, in the crossexamination a suggestion was put to her that the Appellant and her parents were assaulting theRespondent and to avoid getting arrested by the police, the Appellant's mother had got admitted tothe hospital. We find this suggestion on the face of it to be wholly ludicrous. Firstly, there is nopleading by the Respondent that she was ever assaulted by the Appellant and her parents on 25thAugust, 2007. Secondly, no complaint to that effect has ever been filed by the Respondent againstthe Appellant or his parents. Thirdly, in the cross examination, it has been specifically stated by theMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/25Appellant's mother that from 26th August, 2007 till 10th September, 2007, she was under goingchemotherapy treatment for her cancer as she was suffering from breast cancer. All this clearly goesto show that the suggestion put forth to the Appellant's mother that she was admitted to the hospitalonly to avoid the arrest from the Police, is wholly unbelievable.48                 On going through the testimony of the Appellant asAswale                                  50/54                                                        fca.20.16.docwell as of the Appellant's mother, we have no hesitation in holding that the testimony as given by theAppellant as well as his mother has not been in any way shattered by the Respondent. At leastlooking to the preponderance of probabilities and with the evidence on record, we have nohesitation in holding that this incident as narrated by the Appellant and her mother in fact tookplace and was not a concocted story, as sought to be alleged by the Respondent.49 We must also mention that as far as this incident is concerned, the same has been dealt with inthe impugned order at paragraph 98 thereof. The only reason for rejecting this contention of theAppellant and Appellant's mother is that the Respondent was pregnant of about four months at thetime when the alleged incident took place and she had to take care of herself and the child in herwomb, and therefore, it was not believable that she would give a blow to her mother in law causingcomplications to her body. We find this reasoning to be wholly of perverse. Merely because theRespondent was pregnant of about four months, is certainly not a reason to hold that she would notbe able to give a blow to her mother in law. This is the only reason we find in the impugned order forrejecting the contention of the Aswale 51/54 fca.20.16.doc Appellant.50 There are several other incidents that have been narrated such as the incident that took place on19 th November, 2007 where the Respondent filed a complaint against the Appellant and his parentsat Cuffe Parade police station before attacking Appellant's parents house at Ameeta Building. We arenot going into details of these other incidents, considering the fact that the incidents discussed by usherein above are enough to grant a decree of divorce to the Appellant on the ground of cruelty underSection 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 51 Looking to what is stated herein above, andlooking at the facts of the case in their totality, we find that Trial Court had completely gone wrongin not granting a decree of divorce in favour of the Appellant. The mistake that the Trial Court hasmade is that it has wrongly examined each incident independently rather than looking at the case inits totality. Further, we find that some of the major incidents have not even been considered by theTrial Court in the impugned order. Looking to all these facts, we have no hesitation in holding thatMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/26the impugned order suffers from perversity and the Appellant is entitled to a decree of Aswale 52/54fca.20.16.doc divorce.52 In these circumstances, the following order is passed:-(a) The impugned order dated 24th August, 2015 is set aside insofar as it dismissesthe Appellant's Petition seeking a decree of divorce.(b) The marriage solemnized between the Appellant and the Respondent on 5thDecember, 2006 stands dissolved by decree of divorce under Section 13 (1) (ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955.(c) The Appellant is granted a decree of divorce under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the HinduMarriage Act, 1955.(d) Considering that the Appellant has succeeded before us, the direction by the TrialCourt for the Appellant to pay costs of Rs. 15,000/- to the Respondent is also setaside.(e) As far Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the operative part of the impugned order areconcerned, the same are retained.                   (f)      It is clarified that the Appellant shall payAswale                                      53/54                                                              fca.20.16.docmaintenance at the rate of Rs. 15,000/- p. m. for the child from the date of filing ofthe Written Statement till the child attains majority.(g) Arrears, if any, with reference to such maintenance shall also be cleared by theAppellant as expeditiously as possible and in any event within a period of fourmonths from today.(h) Decree of divorce be drawn up accordingly.(i) The Appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs quantified at Rs.50,000/- to be paidMr. Deepak Gokulchand Aggarwal vs Mrs. Meghana Deepak Aggarwal on 27 April, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6564987/27by the Respondent to the Appellant within a period of four weeks from today.
