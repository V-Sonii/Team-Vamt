Section 12 has been amended by Amendment Act, 2015 based on the recommendations of the Law Commission, which specifically dealt with the issue of “neutrality of arbitrators”. To achieve the main purpose for amending the provision, namely, to provide for “neutrality of arbitrators”, sub-section (5) of Section 12 lays down that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. In such an eventuality, i.e., when the arbitration clause is found to be foul with the amended provision, the appointment of the arbitrator would be beyond the pale of the arbitration agreement, empowering the Court to appoint such an arbitrator as may be permissible. That would be the effect of the non obstante clause contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12 and the other party cannot insist upon the appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement.Whether, the Stationery Purchase Committee – Arbitral Tribunal consisting of the officers of the respondent has lost the mandate, considering Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule of the Arbitration Act, 1996.
