Supreme Court of IndiaApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Author: D AnandBench: V.N.Khare           PETITIONER:APPAREL EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL        Vs.RESPONDENT:A.K. CHOPRADATE OF JUDGMENT:       20/01/1999BENCH:V.N.KhareJUDGMENT:DR. ANAND, CJI :Special Leave granted. Does an action of the superior against a female employee which is againstmoral sanctions and does not withstand test of decency and modesty not amount to sexualharassment? Is physical contact with the female employee an essential ingredient of such a charge?Does the allegation that the superior tried to molest a female employee at the place of work, notconstitute an act unbecoming of good conduct and behaviour expected from the superior? These aresome of the questions besides the nature of approach expected from the law courts to casesinvolving sexual harassment which come to the forefront and require our consideration. Referenceto the facts giving rise to the filing of the present Appeal by Special Leave at this stage is appropriate: The respondent was working as a Private Secretary to the Chairman of the Apparel ExportPromotion Council, the appellant herein. It was alleged that on 12.8.1988, he tried to molest awoman employee of the Council, Miss X (name withheld by us) who was at the relevant timeworking as a Clerk-cum-Typist. She was not competent or trained to take dictations. Therespondent, however, insisted that she go with him to the Business Centre at Taj Palace Hotel fortaking dictation from the Chairman and type out the matter. Under the pressure of the respondent,she went to take the dictation from the Chairman. While Miss X was waiting for the Director in theroom, the respondent tried to sit too close to her and despite her objection did not give up hisobjectionable behaviour. She later on took dictation from the Director. The respondent told her totype it at the Business Centre of the Taj Palace Hotel, which is located in the Basement of the Hotel.He offered to help her so that her typing was not found fault with by the Director. He volunteered toshow her the Business Centre for getting the matter typed and taking advantage of the isolatedplace, again tried to sit close to her and touch her despite her objections. The draft typed matter wascorrected by Director (Finance) who asked Miss X to retype the same. The respondent again wentwith her to the Business Centre and repeated his overtures. Miss X told the respondent that sheApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/1would leave the place if he continued to behave like that. The respondent did not stop. Though hewent out from the Business Centre for a while, he again came back and resumed his objectionableacts. According to Miss X, the respondent had tried to molest her physically in the lift also whilecoming to the basement but she saved herself by pressing the emergency button, which made thedoor of the lift to open. On the next day, that is on 16th August, 1988 Miss X was unable to meet theDirector (Personnel) for lodging her complaint against the respondent as he was busy. Shesucceeded in meeting him only on 17th August, 1988 and apart from narrating the whole incident tohim orally submitted a written complaint also. The respondent was placed under suspension vide anorder dated 18th August, 1988. A charge-sheet was served on him to which he gave a reply denyingthe allegations and asserting that the allegations were imaginary and motivated. Shri J.D. Giri, aDirector of the Council, was appointed as an Enquiry Officer to enquire into the charges framedagainst the respondent. On behalf of the management with a view to prove the charges as many assix witnesses were examined including Miss X. The respondent also examined seven witnesses. TheEnquiry Officer after considering the documentary and oral evidence and the circumstances of thecase arrived at the conclusion that the respondent had acted against moral sanctions and that hisacts against Miss X did not withstand the test of decency and modesty. He, therefore, held thecharges levelled against the respondent as proved. The Enquiry Officer in his report recorded thefollowing, amongst other, findings : 8.1. Intentions of Shri A.K. Chopra were ostensibly manifestedin his actions and behaviour; Despite reprimands from Miss X he continued to act against moralsanctions; 8.2. Dictation and subsequent typing of the matter provided Shri A.K. Chopra necessaryopportunity to take Miss X to the Business Centre a secluded place. Privacy in the Business Centreroom made his ulterior motive explicit and clear; 8.3. Any other conclusion on technical nicetieswhich Shri A.K. Chopra tried to purport did not withstand the test of decency and modesty.The Enquiry Officer concluded that Miss X was molested by the respondent at Taj Palace Hotel on12th August, 1988 and that the respondent had tried to touch her person in the Business Centre withulterior motives despite reprimands by her. The Disciplinary Authority agreeing with the report ofthe Enquiry Officer, imposed the penalty of removing him from service with immediate effect on28th June, 1989. Aggrieved, by an order of removal from service, the respondent filed adepartmental appeal before the Staff Committee of the appellant. It appears that there was somedifference of opinion between the Members of the Staff Committee and the Chairman of the StaffCommittee during the hearing, but before any decision could be arrived at by the Staff Committee,the respondent, on the basis of some unconfirmed minutes of the Staff Committee meeting, filed aWrit Petition in the High Court inter alia challenging his removal from service. On January 30,1992, the Writ Petition was allowed and respondent Nos. 1 and 3, therein, were directed to act uponthe decision of the Staff Committee, assuming as if the decision, as alleged, had been taken at the34th Meeting of the Staff Committee on 25th July, 1990. The appellant challenged the judgment andorder of the High Court dated 30th January, 1992, through Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.3204 of1992 in this Court. While setting aside the judgment and order of the High Court dated 30thJanuary, 1992, a Division Bench of this Court opined : We have been taken through the proceedingsof the meeting starting from 33rd meeting upto 38th meeting by both the learned Counsel appearingfor the respective parties. Considering the same it appears to us that the alleged decision taken onthe said Agenda No.5 in the 33rd and 34th meeting is in dispute and final decision on the same hasnot yet been taken and the alleged resolution on the said Item No.5 still awaits ratification. In thatApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/2view of the matter, the High Court was wrong in deciding the disputed question of fact in favour ofRespondent No.1. We, therefore set aside the impugned order of the Delhi High Court as accordingto us the final decision on the resolution taken on the said Agenda No.5 has not yet been finallyratified. We are not inclined to consider the other questions sought to be raised in this appeal andthe said questions are kept open. In view of the pendency of the matter for a long time, we direct theappellantcompany to convene the meeting of Staff Committee as early as practicable but notexceeding two months from today so that the question of ratification of the resolution on the saidAgenda No.5 taken in the meeting of the Staff Committee is finally decided.Pursuant to the above directions, the Staff Committee met again and considered the entire issue andcame to the conclusion that the order passed by the Director General terminating the services of therespondent on 28th June, 1989 was legal, proper and valid. The appeal was dismissed and theremoval of the respondent for causing sexual harassment to Miss X was upheld. The respondent,thereupon, filed Writ Petition No.352 of 1995 in the High Court, challenging his removal fromservice as well as the decision of the Staff Committee dismissing his departmental appeal. Thelearned Single Judge allowing the Writ Petition opined that ... the petitioner tried to molest and notthat the petitioner had in fact molested the complainant. The learned Single Judge, therefore,disposed of the Writ Petition with a direction that the respondent be reinstated in service but that hewould not be entitled to receive any back wages. The appellant was directed to consider the periodbetween the date of removal of the respondent from service and the date of reinstatement as theperiod spent on duty and to give him consequential promotion and all other benefits. It was,however, directed that the respondent be posted in any other office outside Delhi, at least for aperiod of two years. The appellant being aggrieved by the order of reinstatement filed Letters PatentAppeal No.27 of 1997 before the Division Bench of the High Court. The respondent also filed LettersPatent Appeal No.79 of 1997 claiming back wages and appropriate posting. Some of the ladyemployees of the appellant on coming to know about the judgment of the learned Single Judge,directing the reinstatement of the respondent, felt agitated and filed an application seekingintervention in the pending L.P.A. The Division Bench vide judgment and order dated 15th July,1997, dismissed the L.P.A. filed by the appellant against the reinstatement of the respondent. TheDivision Bench agreed with the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge that the respondenthad tried to molest and that he had not actually molested Miss X and that he had not managed tomake the slightest physical contact with the lady and went on to hold that such an act of therespondent was not a sufficient ground for his dismissal from service. Commenting upon theevidence, the Division Bench observed :We have been taken in detail through the evidence/deposition of Miss X. No part of that evidencediscloses that A.K. Chopra even managed to make the slightest physical contact with the lady. Theentire deposition relates that A.K. Chopra tried to touch her. As we have said that no attempts made,allegedly by A.K. Chopra, succeeded in making physical contact with Miss X, even in the narrowconfines of a Hotel lift. To our mind, on such evidence as that was produced before the EnquiryOfficer, it is not even possible to come to a conclusion that there is an attempt to molest as therehave been no physical contact. There being no physical contact between A.K. Chopra and Miss X,there cannot be any attempt to tried to molest on the part of A.K. Chopra. (Emphasis ours)Aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench, the employer- appellant has filed this appeal byApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/3special leave. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The EnquiryOfficer has found the charges established against the respondent. He has concluded that therespondent was guilty of molestation and had tried to physically assault Miss X. The findingsrecorded by the Enquiry Officer and the Disciplinary Authority had been confirmed by the AppellateAuthority (the Staff Committee) which admittedly had co-extensive powers to re-appreciate theevidence as regards the guilt as well as about the nature of punishment to be imposed on therespondent. The Staff Committee while dealing with the question of punishment has observed : ShriChopra has also mentioned in his appeal that the penalty on him was harsh and disproportionate tothe charge levelled against him. On this, the Staff Committee observed that no lenient view would bejustified in a case of molestation of a woman employee when the charge was fully proved. Anylenient action in such a case would have a demoralizing effect on the working women. The StaffCommittee, therefore, did not accept the plea of Shri Chopra that a lenient view be taken in his case.The learned Single Judge, did not doubt the correctness of the occurrence. He did not disbelieve thecomplainant. On a re- appreciation of the evidence on the record, the learned Single Judge,however, drew his own inference and found that the respondent had tried to molest but since he hadnot actually molested the complainant, therefore, the action of the respondent did not warrantremoval from service. The learned Single Judge while directing the reinstatement of the respondentobserved : 15. In the totality of facts and circumstances, ends of justice would meet if the petitioneris reinstated in service but he would not be entitled to any back wages. The Council shall considerthis period as on duty and would give him consequential promotion to the petitioner. He shall beentitled to all benefits except back wages. The petitioner shall be posted in any other office outsideDelhi, at least for a period of two years." (Emphasis ours) The Division Bench of the High Court alsowhile dismissing the L.P.A. filed by the appellant did not doubt the correctness of the occurrence. Italso concluded that since the respondent had not actually molested Miss X and had only tried toassault her and had not managed to make any physical contact with her, a case of his removal fromservice was not made out. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench did not doubt thecorrectness of the following facts : 1. That Miss X was a subordinate employee while the respondentwas the superior officer in the organization; 2. That Miss X was not qualified to take any dictationand had so told the respondent; 3. That the respondent pressurized her to come with him to TajPalace Hotel to take dictation despite her protestation, with an ulterior design; 4. That therespondent taking advantage of his position, tried to molest Miss X and in spite of her protestation,continued with his activities which were against the moral sanctions and did not withstand the testof decency and modesty; 5. That the respondent tried to sit too close to Miss X with ulterior motivesand all along Miss X kept reprimanding him but to no avail; 6. That the respondent was repeatinghis implicit unwelcome sexual advances and Miss X told him that if he continued to behave in thatfashion, she would leave that place; 7. That the respondent acted in a manner which demonstratedunwelcome sexual advances, both directly and by implication; 8. That action of the respondentcreated an intimidated and hostile working environment in so far as Miss X is concerned.The above facts are borne out from the evidence on the record and on the basis of these facts, thedepartmental authorities keeping in view the fact that the actions of the respondent were consideredto be subversive of good discipline and not conducive to proper working in the appellantOrganization where there were a number of female employees, took action against the respondentApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/4and removed him from service. The High Court appears to have over-looked the settled position thatin departmental proceedings, the Disciplinary Authority is the sole Judge of facts and in case anappeal is presented to the Appellate Authority, the Appellate Authority has also the power/andjurisdiction to re-appreciate the evidence and come to its own conclusion, on facts, being the solefact finding authorities. Once findings of fact, based on appreciation of evidence are recorded, theHigh Court in Writ Jurisdiction may not normally interfere with those factual findings unless itfinds that the recorded findings were based either on no evidence or that the findings were whollyperverse and/or legally untenable. The adequacy or inadequacy of the evidence is not permitted tobe canvassed before the High Court. Since, the High Court does not sit as an Appellate Authority,over the factual findings recorded during departmental proceedings, while exercising the power ofjudicial review, the High Court cannot normally speaking substitute its own conclusion, with regardto the guilt of the delinquent, for that of the departmental authorities. Even insofar as imposition ofpenalty or punishment is concerned, unless the punishment or penalty imposed by the Disciplinaryor the Departmental Appellate Authority, is either impermissible or such that it shocks theconscience of the High Court, it should not normally substitute its own opinion and impose someother punishment or penalty. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the HighCourt, it appears, ignored the well-settled principle that even though Judicial Review ofadministrative action must remain flexible and its dimension not closed, yet the Court in exercise ofthe power of judicial review is not concerned with the correctness of the findings of fact on the basisof which the orders are made so long as those findings are reasonably supported by evidence andhave been arrived at through proceedings which cannot be faulted with for procedural illegalities orirregularities which vitiate the process by which the decision was arrived at. Judicial Review, it mustbe remembered, is directed not against the decision, but is confined to the examination of thedecision-making process. Lord Haltom in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans,(1982) 3 All ER 141, observed : The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the individualreceives fair treatment, and not to ensure that the authority, after according fair treatment, reaches,on a matter which it is authorized by law to decide for itself, a conclusion which is correct in the eyesof the court.Judicial Review, not being an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which thedecision was arrived at, the Court while exercising the power of Judicial Review must remainconscious of the fact that if the decision has been arrived at by the Administrative Authority afterfollowing the principles established by law and the rules of natural justice and the individual hasreceived a fair treatment to meet the case against him, the Court cannot substitute its judgment forthat of the Administrative Authority on a matter which fell squarely within the sphere of jurisdictionof that authority. It is useful to note the following observations of this Court in Union of India v.Sardar Bahadur, (1972) 4 SCC 618 : Where there are some relevant materials which the authorityhas accepted and which materials may reasonably support the conclusion that the officer is guilty, itis not the function of the High Court exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 to review thematerials and to arrive at an independent finding on the materials. If the enquiry has been properlyheld the question of adequacy or reliability of the evidence cannot be canvassed before the HighCourt.Apparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/5After a detailed review of the law on the subject, this Court while dealing with the jurisdiction of theHigh Court or Tribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters and punishment in Union of Indiav. Parma Nanda, (1989) 2 SCC 177, opined : We must unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of theTribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters or punishment cannot be equated with anappellate jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot interfere with the findings of the Enquiry Officer orCompetent Authority where they are not arbitrary or utterly perverse. It is appropriate to rememberthat the power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer is conferred on the competent authorityeither by an Act of Legislature or Rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. Ifthere has been an enquiry consistent with the rules and in accordance with principles of naturaljustice what punishment would meet the ends of justice is a matter of exclusively within thejurisdiction of the competent authority. If the penalty can lawfully be imposed and is imposed on theproved misconduct, the Tribunal has no power to substitute its own discretion for that of theauthority.In B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India, (1995 ) 6 SCC 749, this Court opined : The disciplinaryauthority is the sole judge of facts. Where appeal is presented, the appellate authority hascoextensive power to reappreciate them evidence or the nature of punishment. In a DisciplinaryEnquiry, the strict proof of legal evidence and findings on that evidence are not relevant. Adequacyof evidence or reliability of evidence cannot be permitted to be canvassed before the Court/Tribunal.Further it was held :A review of the above legal position would establish that the disciplinary authority, and on appealthe appellate authority, being fact-finding authorities have exclusive power to consider the evidencewith a view to maintain discipline. They are invested with the discretion to impose appropriatepunishment keeping in view the magnitude or gravity of the misconduct. The High Court/Tribunal,while exercising the power of judicial review, cannot normally substitute its own conclusion onpenalty and impose some other penalty. If the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority orthe appellate authority shocks the conscience of the High Court/Tribunal, it would appropriatelymould the relief, either directing the disciplinary/appellate authority to reconsider the penaltyimposed, or to shorten the litigation, it may itself, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriatepunishment with cogent reasons in support thereof.( Emphasis supplied) Again in Government of Tamil Nadu and another v. A. Rajapandian, 1995(1)SCC 216, this Court opined : It has been authoritatively settled by string of authorities of this Courtthat the Administrative Tribunal cannot sit as a court of appeal over a decision based on the findingsof the inquiring authority in disciplinary proceedings. Where there is some relevant material whichthe disciplinary authority has accepted and which material reasonably supports the conclusionreached by the disciplinary authority, it is not the function of the Administrative Tribunal to reviewthe same and reach different finding than that of the disciplinary authority. The AdministrativeTribunal, in this case, has found no fault with the proceedings held by the inquiring authority. It hasquashed the dismissal order by re-appreciating the evidence and reaching a finding different thanthat of the inquiring authority. (Emphasis ours) In the established facts and circumstances of thiscase, we have no hesitation to hold, at the outset, that both the learned Single Judge and theApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/6Division Bench of the High Court fell into patent error in interfering with findings of fact recordedby the departmental authorities and interfering with the quantum of punishment, as if the HighCourt was sitting in appellate jurisdiction. From the judgments of the learned Single Judge as wellas the Division Bench, it is quite obvious that the findings with regard to an unbecoming actcommitted by the respondent, as found by the Departmental Authorities, were not found fault witheven on re-appreciation of evidence. The High Court did not find that the occurrence as alleged bythe complainant had not taken place. Neither the learned Single Judge nor the Division Bench foundthat findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer or the Departmental Appellate Authority were eitherarbitrary or even perverse. As a matter of fact, the High Court found no fault whatsoever with theconduct of Enquiry. The direction of the learned Single Judge to the effect that the respondent wasnot entitled to back wages and was to be posted outside the city for at least two years, which wasupheld by the Division Bench, itself demonstrates that the High Court believed the complainantscase fully for otherwise neither the withholding of back wages nor a direction to post the respondentoutside the city for at least two years was necessary. The High Court in our opinion fell in error ininterfering with the punishment, which could be lawfully imposed by the departmental authoritieson the respondent for his proven misconduct. To hold that since the respondent had not actuallymolested Miss X and that he had only tried to molest her and had not managed to make physicalcontact with her, the punishment of removal from service was not justified was erroneous. The HighCourt should not have substituted its own discretion for that of the authority. What punishment wasrequired to be imposed, in the facts and circumstances of the case, was a matter which fellexclusively within the jurisdiction of the competent authority and did not warrant any interferenceby the High Court. The entire approach of the High Court has been faulty. The impugned order ofthe High Court cannot be sustained on this ground alone. But there is another aspect of the casewhich is fundamental and goes to the root of the case and concerns the approach of the Court whiledealing with cases of sexual harassment at the place of work of female employees. The High Courtwas examining disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and was not dealing with criminaltrial of the respondent. The High Court did not find that there was no evidence at all of any kind ofmolestation or assault on the person of Miss X. It appears that the High Court re-appreciated theevidence while exercising power of judicial review and gave meaning to the expression molestationas if it was dealing with a finding in a criminal trial. Miss X had used the expression molestation inher complaint in a general sense and during her evidence she has explained what she meant.Assuming for the sake of argument that the respondent did not manage to establish any physicalcontact with Miss X, though the statement of management witness Suba Singh shows that therespondent had put his hand on the hand of Miss X when he surprised them in the Business Centre,it did not mean that the respondent had not made any objectionable overtures with sexualovertones. From the entire tenor of the cross-examination to which Miss X was subjected to by therespondent, running into about 17 typed pages and containing more than one hundred & fortyquestions and answers in cross-examinations, it appears that the effort of respondent was only toplay with the use of the expressions molestation and physical assault by her and confuse her. It wasnot the dictionary meaning of the word molestation or physical assault which was relevant. Thestatement of Miss X before the Enquiry Officer as well as in her complaint unambiguously conveyedin no uncertain terms as to what her complaint was. The entire episode reveals that the respondenthad harassed, pestered and subjected Miss X, by a conduct which is against moral sanctions andwhich did not withstand the test of decency and modesty and which projected unwelcome sexualApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/7advances. Such an action on the part of the respondent would be squarely covered by the termsexual harassment. The following statement made by Miss X at the enquiry : When I was there inthe Chairmans room I told Mr. Chopra that this was wrong and he should not do such things. Hetried to persuade me by talking. ......................... I tried to type the material but there were so manymistakes. He helped me in typing. There he tried to blackmail me. ................. He tried to sit with me.In between he tried to touch me............................ Mr. Chopra again took me to the Business Centre.Thereafter again he tried. I told him I will go out if he does like this. Then he went out. Again hecame back. In between he tried. (Emphasis supplied) unmistakably shows that the conduct of therespondent constituted an act unbecoming of good behaviour, expected from the superior officer.Repeatedly, did Miss X state before the Enquiry Officer that the respondent tried to sit close to herand touch her and that she reprimanded him by asking that he should not do these things. Thestatement of Miss Rama Kanwar, the management witness to the effect that when on 16th Augustshe saw Miss X and asked her the reason for being upset, Miss X kept on weeping and told her shecould not tell being unmarried, she could not explain what had happened to her. The material on therecord, thus, clearly establishes an unwelcome sexually determined behaviour on the part of therespondent against Miss X which was also an attempt to outrage her modesty. Any action or gesture,whether directly or by implication, aims at or has the tendency to outrage the modesty of a femaleemployee, must fall under the general concept of the definition of sexual harassment. The evidenceon the record clearly establishes that the respondent caused sexual harassment to Miss X, takingadvantage of his superior position in the Council. Against the growing social menace of sexualharassment of women at the work place, a three Judge Bench of this Court by a rather innovativejudicial law making process issued certain guidelines in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, (1997) 6 SCC241, after taking note of the fact that the present civil and penal laws in the country do notadequately provide for specific protection of woman from sexual harassment at places of work andthat enactment of such a legislation would take a considerable time. In Vishakas case (supra), adefinition of sexual harassment was suggested. Verma, J., (as the former Chief Justice then was),speaking for the three-Judge Bench opined : 2. Definition : For this purpose, sexual harassmentincludes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as :(a) physical contact and advances; (b) a demand or request for sexual favours; (c) sexually-colouredremarks;(d) showing pornography; (e) any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non- verbal conduct of sexualnature.Where any of these acts is committed in circumstances whereunder the victim of such conduct has areasonable apprehension that in relation to the victims employment or work whether she is drawingsalary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise suchconduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem. It is discriminatory forinstance when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that her objection would disadvantageher in connection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when itcreates a hostile work environment. Adverse consequences might be visited if the victim does notconsent to the conduct in question or raises any objection thereto.Apparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/8An analysis of the above definition, shows that sexual harassment is a form of sex discriminationprojected through unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favours and other verbal orphysical conduct with sexual overtones, whether directly or by implication, particularly whensubmission to or rejection of such a conduct by the female employee was capable of being used foreffecting the employment of the female employee and unreasonably interfering with her workperformance and had the effect of creating an intimidating or hostile working environment for her.There is no gainsaying that each incident of sexual harassment, at the place of work, results inviolation of the Fundamental Right to Gender Equality and the Right to Life and Liberty the twomost precious Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. As early as in 1993 atthe ILO Seminar held at Manila, it was recognized that sexual harassment of woman at the workplace was a form of gender discrimination against woman. In our opinion, the contents of thefundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution are of sufficient amplitude to encompass allfacets of gender equality, including prevention of sexual harassment and abuse and the courts areunder a constitutional obligation to protect and preserve those fundamental rights. That sexualharassment of a female at the place of work is incompatible with the dignity and honour of a femaleand needs to be eliminated and that there can be no compromise with such violations, admits of nodebate. The message of international instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 (CEDAW) and the Beijing Declaration which directsall State parties to take appropriate measures to prevent discrimination of all forms against womenbesides taking steps to protect the honour and dignity of women is loud and clear. The InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains several provisions particularlyimportant for women. Article 7 recognises her right to fair conditions of work and reflects thatwomen shall not be subjected to sexual harassment at the place of work which may vitiate workingenvironment. These international instruments cast an obligation on the Indian State to gendersensitise its laws and the Courts are under an obligation to see that the message of the internationalinstruments is not allowed to be drowned. This Court has in numerous cases emphasised that whilediscussing constitutional requirements, court and counsel must never forget the core principleembodied in the International Conventions and Instruments and as far as possible give effect to theprinciples contained in those international instruments. The Courts are under an obligation to givedue regard to International Conventions and Norms for construing domestic laws more so whenthere is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in domestic law. [See with advantagePrem Sankar v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1980 SC 1535; Mackninnon Mackenzie and Co. v. AudreyD Costa, (1987) 2 SCC 469 JT 1987 (2) SC 34; Sheela Barse v. Secretary, Childrens Aid Society,(1987) 3 SCC 50 at p.54; Vishaka & others v. State of Rajasthan & Ors., JT 1997 (7) SC 392; PeoplesUnion for Civil Liberties v. Union of India & Anr., JT 1997 (2) SC 311 and D.K. Basu & Anr. v. Stateof West Bengal & Anr., (1997) 1 SCC 416 at p.438]. In cases involving violation of human rights, theCourts must for ever remain alive to the international instruments and conventions and apply thesame to a given case when there is no inconsistency between the international norms and thedomestic law occupying the field. In the instant case, the High Court appears to have totally ignoredthe intent and content of the International Conventions and Norms while dealing with the case. Theobservations made by the High Court to the effect that since the respondent did not actually molestMiss X but only tried to molest her and, therefore, his removal from service was not warranted rebelagainst realism and lose their sanctity and credibility. In the instant case, the behaviour ofrespondent did not cease to be outrageous for want of an actual assault or touch by the superiorApparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K. Chopra on 20 January, 1999Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/856194/9officer. In a case involving charge of sexual harassment or attempt to sexually molest, the courts arerequired to examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by insignificantdiscrepancies or narrow technicalities or dictionary meaning of the expression molestation. Theymust examine the entire material to determine the genuineness of the complaint. The statement ofthe victim must be appreciated in the background of the entire case. Where the evidence of thevictim inspires confidence, as is the position in the instant case, the courts are obliged to rely on it.Such cases are required to be dealt with great sensitivity. Sympathy in such cases in favour of thesuperior officer is wholly misplaced and mercy has no relevance. The High Court overlooked theground realities and ignored the fact that the conduct of the respondent against his junior femaleemployee, Miss X, was wholly against moral sanctions, decency and was offensive to her modesty.Reduction of punishment in a case like this is bound to have demoralizing effect on the womenemployees and is a retrograde step. There was no justification for the High Court to interfere withthe punishment imposed by the departmental authorities. The act of the respondent wasunbecoming of good conduct and behaviour expected from a superior officer and undoubtedlyamounted to sexual harassment of Miss X and the punishment imposed by the appellant, was, thus,commensurate with the gravity of his objectionable behaviour and did not warrant any interferenceby the High Court in exercise of its power of judicial review. At the conclusion of the hearing,learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent was repentant of his actions andthat he tenders an unqualified apology and that he was willing to also go and to apologize to Miss X.We are afraid, it is too late in the day to show any sympathy to the respondent in such a case. Anylenient action in such a case is bound to have demoralizing effect on working women. Sympathy insuch cases is uncalled for and mercy is misplaced. Thus, for what we have said above the impugnedorder of the High Court is set aside and the punishment as imposed by the Disciplinary Authorityand upheld by the Departmental Appellate Authority of removal of the respondent from service isupheld and restored. The, appeals, thus succeed and are allowed. We, however, make no order as tocosts.Apparel Export Promotion Council vs A.K.
