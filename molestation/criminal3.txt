After the completion of the investigation, challan was filed in the Court and as a prima-facie casewas found .against the accused, he was charged for commission of offences punishable under Sections 376 and506 of IPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.5. Learned trial Court vide its judgment under challenge acquitted the accused by holding thatprosecution had failed to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Whilearriving at the said conclusion, it was held by the learned trial Court that statement of prosecutrixdemonstrated that there was inconsistency in the same. Learned trial Court held that prosecutrix inher application Ext. PW1/A had mentioned that she was suffering from some unknown disease andit was her sister PW6 Reenu who introduced her to accused, who thereafter in the guise of hertreatment, raped her, however, the prosecutrix had not disclosed the first date on which the accusedcame to her in-laws house. Learned trial Court held that as per prosecutrix accused forcibly established physicalrelations with her for the first time on 11.06.2013 and thereafter on 12.06.2013, accused againcommitted rape with her in a vehicle after making her consume something. Learned trial Courtfurther held that prosecutrix had also deposed that she gained consciousness at Kandrour andthereafter, accused took her .to Chandigarh and accused committed rape with her at Chandigarh also against her wish. Learnedtrial Court further held that in Ext. PW1/A, prosecutrix had nowhere disclosed that accused rapedher at Kandrour or that accused was planning to sell her in Rajasthan for a consideration of `3,00,000/- nor was there any whisper in Ext. PW1/A that accused received telephonic call from hermother-in-law, his wife and the police of Police Post Baldwara. Learned trial Court held that allthese facts were disclosed by the prosecutrix in her statement Ext. PW1/C given before learnedACJM, Sarkaghat under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. Learned trial Court further held that on 04.08.2013,prosecutrix had introduced another story to the effect that she was raped at a place near Kandrourbridge inside the vehicle whereas this was not disclosed by her to PW11 Inspector Kamla Ghai butwas disclosed later to PW12 ASI Jagdish. Learned trial Court also held that a perusal of the site planExt. PW11/A which pertained to the house of in-laws of the prosecutrix demonstrated that therewere four rooms alongwith a verandah and the place of occurrence was shown as mark A.Learned trial Court held that site plan demonstrated that in fact all the rooms of the house wereinter-connected and in .case the statement of prosecutrix was to be taken as a gospel truth that she was forcibly raped byaccused 15-16 days prior to 11.06.2013, then the whisper of the accused and prosecutrix would havebeen heard by her husband and other family members who were sleeping in adjoining rooms,however, nothing was deposed to this effect by her husband PW3 Ramesh Kumar. Learned trialCourt also held that PW17 HHC Ranbir Singh in his cross examination deposed that on 14.06.2013,prosecutrix had come to PP Hatli alongwith Up Pradhan PW5 Prakash Chand, her husband PW3Ramesh Kumar, her father-in-law PW2 Mansha Ram and her mother-Decided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/3in-law and rapat No. 18 dated 14.06.2013 was entered in rojnamcha to this effect and prosecutrixhad given statement that she had voluntarily gone after the accused and she was not abducted by theaccused. Learned trial Court further held that this witness further stated that prosecutrix deposedthat accused had not done anything wrong with her. Learned trial Court held that this rapat No. 18had been intentionally withheld by the prosecution. Learned trial Court also held that as per PW17,prosecutrix had not blamed accused for any wrong act. Learned trial Court also took note of the factthat prosecutrix had deposed in the Court that on .13.06.2013, police made a call to the accused on his mobile and the accused had asked her to informthe police that she had married him (accused). Learned trial Court held that prosecutrix had alsodeposed that wife of accused had made a telephonic call and accused disclosed that he had notabducted any woman. Learned trial Court also took note of the fact that mother of the prosecutrixPW7 Jamna Devi had a totally different story to narrate and she had deposed that in-laws of prosecutrix disclosed to her that prosecutrix had run away with one Baba, however, missingreport was lodged at Police Post Hatli on 13.06.2013. Learned trial Court also held that PW7 in herstatement recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C deposed that prosecutrix came to her house at 1:00a.m. in the intervening night of 13/14.06.2013 and disclosed that she was abducted by the accused,however, in her cross examination, she disowned her statement by saying that prosecutrix neverdisclosed to her that she (prosecutrix) was abducted by accused. On these bases, it was held bylearned trial Court that testimony of the prosecutrix was totally unbelievable and rather it emergedthat there was no cogent and reliable evidence to show that prosecutrix was ever found inside thevehicle of accused either at Kandrour or at .Chandigarh. Learned trial Court also held that even on the basis of medical evidence, it could not beconcluded that prosecutrix had been raped by the accused especially when there was nothing onrecord to demonstrate that prosecutrix was not having physical relations with her husband inbetween 14.06.2013 to 19.06.2013. Learned trial Court also held that as far as factum of extendingthreat to prosecutrix was concerned, there was no cogent and reliable evidence to this effect and saidfacts were neither disclosed by prosecutrix to PW7 Jamna Devi, whom she (prosecutrix) met afterher alleged abduction nor to Up Pradhan PW5 Prakash Chand, whom she met on 14.06.2013 andshe did not disclose such facts in PP Hatli where rapat No. 18 was recorded on the same day. Onthese bases, it was held by the learned trial Court that statement of prosecutrix was not inspiringconfidence to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.6. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment so passed by learned trial Court, the State has filed this appeal.7. We have heard the learned Additional Advocate General as well as Mr. Karan Singh Kanwar,learned counsel appearing for the respondent. We have also gone through the records of the case aswell as the judgment passed by learned .trial Court.Decided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/48. It is settled law that for the purpose of conviction of accused charged with committing the offencepunishable under Section 376 of IPC, sole testimony of prosecutrix is sufficient provided thetestimony of the prosecutrix is cogent, reliable and trustworthy and the same inspires confidence inthe Court. A perusal of the judgment passed by learned trial Court demonstrates that it has beenmentioned therein that the testimony of the prosecutrix in the present case is not worth inspiringconfidence as there were contradictions in her statement and some corroborative evidence to lendcredence to the same was lacking in the case. Therefore, we have now to ascertain as to whether thefindings so returned by learned trial Court are borne out from the records of the case or same areperverse.9.

Now when we appreciate ocular testimony of prosecution witnesses, it is apparently evident thatafter the prosecutrix was dropped near the house of her parents on the intervening night of13/14.06.2013 at about 1:00 a.m. and thereafter when she went to police post for the first time on .14.06.2013, she had made a statement to the effect that she had voluntarily gone with the accusedand also returned back of her own volition. This factum is borne out from the cross examination ofthe prosecutrix herself as well as from the testimony of PW17 Ranvir Singh.20. We have already referred to the complaint filed by the prosecutrix initially, on the basis ofwhich, FIR was lodged on 17.06.2013 as well as to her statement recorded under Section 164 ofCr.P.C and her deposition in the Court as PW1.A perusal of all these demonstrates that there are lot of improvements and contradictions in thecomplaint, statement of prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C and her deposition madein the Court of law as PW1 which renders the version of the prosecutrix to be highly unbelievable.The prosecutrix wants this Court to believe that in an intoxicated position, she was abducted by theaccused from the house of her in-laws, wherein besides the prosecutrix and her minor son, herhusband and her in-laws were putting up and no one came to know of this fact. Not only this, shealso wants this Court to believe that before the said abduction of the prosecutrix, she was sexuallyassaulted by the accused against her wish in the house of her in-laws during night .hours and none noticed this fact. It is prosecutrix's own case that it is not as if accused used to sleepwith her in her room but accused used to sleep with her husband in a separate room. As perprosecutrix after her husband went to sleep, accused came to her room and sexually molested her.She further stated that when accused sexually molested her, her minor son used to sleep in otherDecided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/10room. However, when we peruse the testimony of PW2 Mansha Ram, father-in-law of prosecutrix,he has deposed that minor son of prosecutrix used to sleep with her and on the fateful night theywere woken up by the cries of minor child and when they went to see as to what had happened, theyfound prosecutrix missing and later found that accused was also missing with his vehicle.21. In complaint Ext. PW1/A, it is not mentioned that after the accused had abducted the prosecutrixon the night of 12.06.2013 and after she gained consciousness near Kandrour bridge, he had rapedher at Kandrour bridge.Besides this, it is not mentioned in the said complaint that while at Chandigarh, she heard accusedtalking with someone that the prosecutrix was to be taken to Rajasthan and there she was to be soldfor ` 3,00,000/-. Now when we refer to her .statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C, there are improvements made to the effect that as per theprosecutrix, after she was abducted by the accused on the night of 12.06.2013 and taken toChandigarh by accused, he asked her to marry him and when she refused to do so, he told her thathe would send her to Rajasthan after two days.22. rSimilarly, it is not so recorded in complaint Ext.PW1/A that while at Chandigarh, any telephonic call was received by the accused frommother-in-law of the prosecutrix and accused threatened the prosecutrix to inform her mother-in-law that both of them had married to each other however this finds mention in her statementrecorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C before learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Sarkaghat.23. It is not mentioned in the complaint Ext. PW1/A that at Chandigarh, accused had asked theprosecutrix to go back to her house and prosecutrix told him that she was not having money andtherefore, he should drop her at the place from where he had abducted her but it is so mentioned inthe statement of prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C..24. Now when we compare the complaint and statement of prosecutrix under Section 164 of Cr.P.Cwith her deposition made in the court of law, it is evident from the cross examination of theprosecution that she not only admitted that she had stated before the police on 14.06.2013 that shehad voluntarily gone with the accused and had returned back on her own, she also admitted it to becorrect that no rape was committed on her by the accused at Chandigarh.25. When we compare these contradicting statements of the prosecutrix including her initialcomplaint with the testimonies of other prosecution witnesses especially Up Pradhan PrakashChand (PW5) and PW17 Ranvir Singh, it is apparent that in fact on 14.06.2013 statement was madeby the prosecutrix at concerned police post that she had gone alongwith accused of her own andreturned back at her own will and it was subsequently that she was forced, may be by her in-laws orDecided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/11by her husband, to lodge complaint against the accused.26. The testimony of the husband of the prosecutrix is both unnatural and unreliable. In hisexamination-in-chief, .this witness has deposed that accused came to his house to treat his wife and he used to sleep withhim in his house and that on 13th he took his wife during night hours and the matter was reported tothe police and then his parents visited the house of accused and thereafter he did not remember asto what happened. Not only this, in his cross examination, this witness deposed that his wife neverdisclosed to him that accused had committed rape on her. It is slightly difficult to believe thataccused who as per prosecution was sleeping with husband of prosecutrix in his house was able tosexually molest his (PW3's) wife on more than two occasions and PW3 never came to know aboutanything. Similarly, the testimony of her mother PW7 Jamna Devi also fortifies the fact thatprosecutrix had on her own volition gone with the accused as this witness in herexamination-in-chief deposed that during summer days, she was informed by in-laws of prosecutrixthat prosecutrix had run away with one Baba and when prosecutrix called her at around 1:00 a.m. inthe night, she opened the door and slapped her twice or thrice and thereafter prosecutrix did nottalk with them, neither did she had any meal. This witness also deposed that thereafter they calledmother-in-law of prosecutrix and her son took the .prosecutrix to the house of Up Pradhan in the morning. In her cross examination, this witness alsodeposed that she had not disclosed to the police that prosecutrix had told her on the night on13/14.06.2013 that she was abducted by accused and was dropped by him.27. From what we have discussed above, it is apparent that on the basis of testimony of theprosecution witnesses as well as documents placed on record by the prosecution, the prosecutionwas not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that in fact the accused had taken away theprosecutrix from the house of her in-laws on the intervening night of 12/13.06.2013 or that he hadoutraged the modesty of prosecutrix against her will. On the contrary, it is apparent and evidentfrom the statements of prosecution witnesses including the statement of Up Pradhan and PW17Ranvir Singh that on 14.06.2013, prosecutrix had stated at Police Post Baldwara that she had gonealongwith accused of her own free will and thereafter returned back of her own free will andsubsequently she was forced, may be by her in-laws or husband to lodge a false complaint againstthe accused.28. In these circumstances, especially when the prosecution has not been able to prove the guilt ofaccused .beyond reasonable doubt and when testimony of prosecutrix is neither cogent nor trustworthy northe same seems to be reliable, it cannot be said that learned trial Court erred in acquitting theaccused for commission of offences with which he was charged.29. There is no material on record placed by the prosecution from which it can be inferred that anythreats etc. were induced by the accused to the prosecutrix so as to render the accused liable forDecided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/12being punished for commission of offence punishable under Section 506 of IPC. There is no cogentevidence on record that prosecutrix was intimidated by the accused as has been alleged by theprosecution.30. Besides this, we have also carefully gone through the judgment passed by the learned trial Courtand a perusal of the judgment passed by learned trial Court demonstrates that the entire evidenceproduced on record by the prosecution had been minutely taken into consideration by the learnedtrial Court and after a careful consideration of the same, learned trial Court had returned the findingof acquittal in favour of accused.31. Therefore, while concurring with the findings of acquittal returned by learned trial Court, wedismiss the .present appeal being devoid of any merit, so also pending miscellaneous application(s), if any.(Sanjay Karol) Acting Chief Justice (Ajay Mohan Goel) Judge May __, 2017.(narender)Decided On: 03.05.2017 vs Prakash Chand on 3 May, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32791981/13
