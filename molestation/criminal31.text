Central Excise Act, 1944 – Section 5A –  Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) – Power to grant exemption from duty of excise – Terminal Excise Duty (TED) – Refund of.1. Whether the entities herein are entitled to refund of amount purportedly towards TED in respect of specified goods procured or supplied, as the case may be, being deemed exports and from which authority, either under applicable Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) or the 1944 Act ?2. Whether Circular No.16 (RE­2012/2009­14) dated 15.03.2013 is merely clarificatory regarding TED refund and exemption and the efficacy thereof?The EOU entities, who had procured and imported specified goods from DTA supplier, are entitled to do so without payment of duty [as in para 6.2(b)] having been ab initio exempted from such liability under para 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP, being deemed exports. Besides this, there is no other entitlement of EOU under the applicable FTP. Indeed, under para 6.11(a) of the FTP, EOU is additionally eligible merely to avail of entitlements of DTA supplier as specified in Chapter 8 of the FTP upon production of a suitable disclaimer from the DTA supplier and subject to compliance of necessary formalities and stipulations. It would not be a case of entitlement of EOU, but only a benefit passed on to EOU for having paid such amount to the DTA supplier, which was otherwise ab initio exempted in terms of para 6.11(c)(ii) of the FTP coupled with the obligation to import the same without payment of duty under para 6.2(b).
