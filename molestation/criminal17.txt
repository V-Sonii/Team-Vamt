Brief facts of the case, as culled out from the writ petition, are that the petitioner was appointed asmusic teacher in National Institute for the Visually Handicapped at Dehradun, now called asNational Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities (hereinafter to bereferred as the NIEPVD) in the year 2005. On 05.04.2018, a complaint was submitted before thePrincipal, Model School for Visually Handicapped by a student of class VII (name withheld) statingthat he has been molested by the petitioner on 05.03.2018 in 3rd period. The complainant allegedthat he has been often going to the petitioner's class even when it was not his music period. On theaforesaid date, he was all alone with the petitioner missing his sports period. He alleged that thepetitioner tried to sodomize him before this also in train when the students and the petitioner werereturning from Jaipur on 13.02.2018. He shared the incident of molestation with his seniorstudents. He also stated that the petitioner has molested his one other classmate also in the monthof February. On receiving the complaint, the Principal reported the same to the second respondenton 06.04.2018. On the information so received from the Principal NIEPVD, the second respondent,vide an office order dated 09.04.2018, appointed Shri Virendra Singh, Braille Development Officer,as Inquiry Officer to enquire into the matter and submit the report within a week's time.Thereafter, the Inquiry Officer, issued a letter dated 10.04.2018 to the petitioner to appear beforehim on 11.04.2018. During the course of enquiry, the petitioner was apprised about the allegationslevelled against him, which was denied by the petitioner. Before the inquiry officer, petitionersubmitted that the complaint has been lodged at the instigation of some other person with someulterior motive. The inquiry officer submitted the preliminary enquiry report on 08.05.2018observing that prima facie the allegations made against the petitioner are found true. Thereafter, thepetitioner was served with a charge-sheet dated 22.05.2018 wherein following two charges werelevelled against him:-  (i)    That Master Aditya Bhargra, a student of class         VII    complained       that     Shri   Ramesh       ChandKashyap, Music Teacher, molested him on 5th March, 2018. The said student has further allegedthat Mr. Kashyap had earlier also tried to sodomize him in train when he was returning withstudents from Jaipur on 13th Feb 2018. Master Aditya Bahgra also mentioned in his complaint thatShri Ramesh Chand Kashyap has molested Master Deepanshu Palival, his classmate also, in themonth of February, 2018. Master Deepanshu has himself mentioned about his molestation in hisnote dated 06.04.2018. That the petitioner has failed to maintain absolute integrity, devotion toduty and also acted in a manner is unbecoming of a public servant in contravention of Rule 3(1)(i),3(1)(iii) of the CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964.(ii) That Shri Ramesh Chand Kashyap, Music Teacher called Master Aditya Bhagra on 5th March,2018 in 3rd period when Mr. Kashyap molested the said student. As the 3rd period for Class VIstudents was for sports, calling the said student to his room for music session unauthorisedlywithout permission of the sports teacher or the Principal, demonstrates that Mr. Kashyap hadmalafide intention of molesting this student when the other students were not around as they hadgone to attend sports class. Therefore, Mr. Ramesh Chand Kashyap has acted in a manner which isunbecoming of a public servant and thereby contravened provisions of Rules 3(1)(i), 3(1)(iii) of theCCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964.Unknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/23. After serving the charge-sheet, the petitioner was placed under suspension by the secondrespondent vide order dated 23.05.2018 and thereafter the disciplinary proceedings werecommenced. On the selfsame day, in WPPIL No.07 of 2016, in the case of Shivangi Gangwar vs.State of Uttarkhand, the Division Bench of this Court, vide judgment and order dated 23.05.2018,issued certain directions to the State Government, including the one to put Mr. Ramesh ChandKashyap, Music Teacher, Visually Handicapped, 116 Rajpur road, Dehradun, under suspensionforthwith and to commence Disciplinary Proceedings against him for violating the human rights anddignity of the child of the School and to conclude the same within three months. A further directionwas issued to the Director General of Police, State of Uttarakhand to register FIR against thepetitioner under POCSO Act and Indian Penal Code and to conclude the inquiry and investigationwithin three weeks from today and thereafter to put the Challan in the Court of Law. Thereafter, on24.05.2018, one Shri Suresh Uniyal of "bachpan bachao andolan" submitted a written report to theIn-charge Polcie Station Rajpur, Dehradun to lodge a report against the petitioner, on the basiswhereof, FIR was lodged against the petitioner under Section 5/6 of the POCSO Act.4. Pursuant to the charge memo dated 22.05.2018, petitioner submitted his reply/written statementon 26.05.2018. In the written statement, he denied all the charges and stated that charges itself arefull of contradiction. He stated that besides the departmental inquiry, one other inquiry is also beingconducted against him by the Government under the orders of this Court, on similar charges, thus,he prayed that the departmental inquiry should be stopped. Pursuant to the FIR lodged by SureshUniyal, the petitioner was arrested by the police on 04.06.2018. In criminal proceeding, oncompletion of investigation, charge-sheet was submitted in the court and the trial begun.5. Thereafter, the second respondent, by two separate orders passed on dated 20.06.2018,appointed Smt. Daljeet Kaur, Principal, Patrician College, Rajpur Road, Dehradun and Smt. NeerajGandhi, as the Inquiry Officer and the Presenting Officer, respectively. On 19.07.2018, the InquiryOfficer issued notices to the witness, requiring their appearance as state witnesses. On the otherside, on completion of trial, the trial court, vide judgment and order dated 28.09.2018, acquitted thepetitioner from the charges levelled against him.After acquittal, the suspension order of the petitioner was revoked vide order dated 09.10.2018.6. It is stated that on 12.10.2018 the petitioner received a letter issued by Shri K.G. Gupta, wherein itwas stated that he was appointed as Inquiry Officer vide office order dated 19/20.07.2018 by theDirector, NIEPVD and that the petitioner has chosen not to accept any communication regardingthis inquiry and have not participated in the enquiry proceedings. Petitioner was given time by23.10.2018 to submit his written brief of defence in the matter and it was stated that in the absenceof any defence brief from the petitioner, the Inquiry Officer would be constrained to finalize thereport in the matter. In response to the letter dated 12.10.2018, petitioner submitted hisrepresentation dated 18.10.2018 stating that he has been acquitted by the trial court vide judgmentdated 28.09.2018.7. After revocation of suspension order and rendering the service for about one month, thepetitioner was again placed under suspension vide order dated 22.11.2018. Thereafter, the petitionerUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/3was served with a notice dated 01.02.2019 issued by the ad-hoc disciplinary authority inter aliastating therein that the petitioner did not participate either in the preliminary hearing or in theregular proceedings despite repeated summon issued to him and as such the Inquiry Officer ShriK.G. Gupta conducted the inquiry ex-parte and in the inquiry report observed that the articles ofcharge levelled against the petitioner are fully established. The inquiry report was submitted beforethe disciplinary authority. On receipt of report, the ad-hoc disciplinary authority issued a noticedated 01.02.2019 to the petitioner calling his written representation or submission within 15 days.Petitioner submitted his detailed reply dated 15.02.2019 before the Ad-hoc DisciplinaryAuthority/Director, stating that he had already submitted a detailed representation/reply dated26.05.2018 in response to the charge memo dated 22.05.2018. He further stated that despiteknowing the fact that the petitioner is in jail and is not able to participate in the departmentalinquiry, the Inquiry Officer continued the said inquiry and issued a number of summons throughJailor to the applicant to appear before him to participate in the departmental inquiry. He alsostated in the criminal case no.67/2018 under section 377, 511 of IPC and under Section 5/6 ofPOCSO Act 2012 registered against the petitioner on same allegations, he has been acquitted by thetrial court. After acquittal, the departmental inquiry, on the same set of charges, is not sustainable inthe eyes of law. He also stated that the departmental proceedings were conducted at the back of thepetitioner without affording him a reasonable opportunity of hearing. Vide order dated 12.03.2019,third respondent i.e. the Ad-hoc Disciplinary Authority, held that the charges stand establishedagainst the petitioner and accordingly imposed a penalty of 'removable from service with immediateeffect' upon the petitioner. There-against, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the appellateauthority, which was dismissed by the Under Secretary to the Government of India, vide order dated03.07.2019.8. Being aggrieved by the orders dated 12.03.2019 and 03.07.2019, petitioner has filed the presentwrit petition on the following main grounds:-a. The complaint so received by the Principal was submitted on the instructions ofSuchit Narang, who was appointed in the Institute as music teacher on temporarybasis, and who had personal grudge with the petitioner. It is contended that he(Suchit Narang) himself is also facing trial in POCSO Court, Dehradun, for thecharges of molestation of girl students.b. That on the basis of same set of charges, criminal case was also lodged against thepetitioner wherein on completion of evidence and trial, he has been acquitted by thetrial court beyond reasonable doubt for the charges levelled against him. It iscontended that after acquittal of the petitioner in the said criminal case, thedepartmental proceedings cannot be proceeded with. c. Besides this, it is alsocontended that ex- parte inquiry proceedings were carried out by the departmentwithout affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. d. That twoinquiry officers one Smt. Daljeet Kaur and second Shri K.G. Gupta were appointed asevident from the letters dated 19.07.2018 and 12.10.2018. It is contended that ShriK.G. Gupta cannot be appointed as inquiry officer to inquire under the CCS (CCA)Rules 1965 being a retired employee of O.N.G.C. As such the inquiry report submittedUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/4by Shri K.G. Gupta is unsustainable in the eyes of law.e. That after revocation of suspension order, after almost one month, the petitionerwas again placed under suspension by the respondents for the reasons best known tothem.f. That the appeal of the petitioner has been decided by the Under Secretary,Government of India. It is contended that the appellate authority functions as quasijudicial authority and cannot delegate powers to lower authority as such the orderdated 03.07.2019 is non-est in the eyes of law.9. Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondent no.2 wherein the averments made in thewrit petition have been denied. It is further stated that after initiation of the departmental inquirythe petitioner refused to acknowledge any communication sent to him by the Inquiring Authority.He did not express his inability to participate in the departmental inquiry himself or through hisdefence assistant. Under these circumstances, the departmental inquiry was proceeded ex-parteagainst him. It is also stated that instead of submitting his written brief or submitting anyapplication before the Inquiring Authority to defend the case, the petitioner submitted his allegedrepresentation dated 18.10.2018 stating that he has been acquitted by the trial court in the criminalcase vide judgment dated 28.09.2018 and that based on that, the departmental inquiry be droppedagainst him. He was thus reluctant to participate in the departmental inquiry from the beginningwhen he was served with the charge sheet by the Disciplinary Authority till the end when he wascalled upon by the Inquiring Authority to submit his written brief.10. It is also stated that initially vide order dated 20.06.2018 the Disciplinary Authority appointedSmt. Daljeet Kaur, Principal, Patrician College, Rajpur Road, Dehradun, as the Inquiring Authoritybut as the said Inquiring Authority expressed her inability to conduct the inquiry, vide another orderdated 19/20.07.2018, Shri K.G. Gupta, Ex. GGM (HR & Pers.), ONGC, was appointed as theInquiring Authority to conduct the departmental inquiry. It is stated that the Shri K.G. Gupta, beinga retired employee of a PSU, was fully competent to be appointed as an Inquiring Authority.11. In the counter affidavit, it is also stated that a preliminary hearing was conducted by theInquiring Authority on 07.08.2018 and a copy of the minutes of the said hearing were served uponthe petitioner on 08.08.2018 which the petitioner refused to receive declaring that he would notreceive any communications from the respondents till his case continues in the Court. The petitionernowhere in his written statement or in any subsequent communication pleaded his inability toparticipate in the departmental inquiry either himself or through a defence assistant. It is also statedthat after receiving the alleged representation dated 18.10.2018 from the petitioner the InquiringAuthority once again served the petitioner with another notice dated 24.10.2018 calling upon tosubmit his written brief of defence latest by 01.11.2018 but there was no further communicationfrom the petitioner and he did not appear before the Inquiring Authority despite all opportunitieswhereafter the Inquiring Authority prepared and submitted his enquiry report before theDisciplinary Authority on 14.11.2018. The Disciplinary Authority agreed with the findings arrived atby the Inquiring Authority. The petitioner was accorded an opportunity of representing against theUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/5inquiry report vide notice dated 01.02.2019 and pursuant thereto the petitioner represented againstthe inquiry report vide representation dated 15.02.2019.12. Petitioner has filed the rejoinder affidavit reiterating the pleadings made in the writ petition.13. Thereafter, a supplementary affidavit was also filed by the petitioner whereby two letters dated17.05.2019 were brought on record by the petitioner. Petitioner alleged that the said communicationreveal about the authenticity of the Inquiry Officer.14. Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondent nos.1 to 3 against the supplementaryaffidavit stating that the petitioner cannot argue that appointment of inquiry officer was not properor that inquiry officer was not competent at this belated stage when the said fact was within theknowledge of the petitioner for the very inception of filing of the writ petition. It is also stated thatthe petitioner has also not pointed out any prejudice caused to him. It is stated that the inquiry wasconducted under rules and in accordance with the principal of natural justice and no de factoprejudice is pleaded or shown by cogent documentation.15. I have heard Shri Ram Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Arvind Vashishtha,learned Senior Counsel along with Smt. Monika Pant, learned counsel for respondent no.2.16. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the ex-parte disciplinary inquiry has beendone at the back of the petitioner without affording any reasonable opportunity to defend himselfwhich is against settled principle of law of natural justice. It is submitted that the inquiry proceedingwas started on 07.08.2018 and closed on 10.09.2018 during which period the petitioner was in jailfrom 04.06.2018 to 28.09.2018. Learned counsel would submit that the ex- parte inquiry report isbased on surmises and conjecture and circumstantial evidence. It is submitted that in the saidex-parte disciplinary inquiry, the main complainant did not appear and was not examined, whichshows the mala fide intention of the respondents.17. Learned counsel for the petitioner would further submit that Shri K.G. Gupta cannot beappointed as Inquiry Officer to inquire under the CCS (CCA) Rules 1965, as he was more than 70years of age on the date of his appointment as Inquiry Officer and he is not a retired governmentofficer. It is submitted that Shri K.G. Gupta is a retired officer of O.N.G.C. and his date of birth is21.01.1942, as such, his age on the date of empanelment i.e. on 19/20.07.2018 is 76 years.18. He would further submit that the facts and evidence of the charges in criminal case and thedepartmental proceedings against the petitioner were same and identical, without there being anyiota of difference, and in the criminal proceeding, the petitioner has been acquitted by the trial courtbeyond any reasonable doubt. It is submitted that after the acquittal of the petitioner on merit, thedepartmental proceeding on identical facts and charges, should not be allowed to continue and theimpugned order dated 12.03.2019 is liable to be quashed as such.19. He would further submit that after the acquittal of the petitioner from the POCSO court thesuspension order was revoked by the respondents, but thereafter again, the respondents for theUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/6reasons best known to them, passed an order whereby the petitioner was again placed undersuspension.20. To buttress his submissions, learned counsel would place reliance on the following judgments:-(a) Capt. M. Paul Anthony vs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd.& Ors. (1999) 3 SCC 679(b) G.M. Tank vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. (2006) 5 SCC 446(c) Union of India & Ors. Vs. Naman Singh Sekhawat (2008) 4 SCC 121. Per contra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent no.2 would submit that in theinquiry proceedings ample opportunity was given to the petitioner to defend himself but he wasreluctant to participate in the same. He would further submit that during the course of inquiry thepetitioner never raised any objection regarding the appointment of Shri K.G. Gupta as InquiryOfficer.22. Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that merely on the basis of acquittal in criminalproceedings, the departmental proceedings cannot be discontinued. He would submit that acquittalin the criminal case have no relevance to the facts of the departmental proceedings as the standardof proof in both the cases are totally different. In a criminal case, the prosecution has to prove thecriminal case beyond all reasonable doubt whereas in a departmental proceeding, the departmenthas to prove only preponderance of probabilities.23. Having heard the rival submissions of learned counsel for the parties and having perused theaffidavits, counter affidavits and rejoinder affidavit as well as the other documents brought onrecord, I am of the considered view that the departmental proceedings initiated against thepetitioner is unsustainable in the eyes of law and the impugned order of imposing punishment ofremoval from service upon the petitioner is liable to be quashed for the following reasons:-(i) Inquiry conducted by Shri K.G. Gupta, Inquiry Officer and the report submitted thereafter isvitiated in law as the same has been done by a person who was not competent to do the same.Record reveals that the date of birth of Shri K.G. Gupta is 21.01.1942. He was appointed as InquiryOfficer in the matter vide order dated 19/20.07.2018. As such, on the date of his appointment asInquiry Officer, he was aged about 76 years. Annexure SA-5 and Annexure SA-6 enclosed along withthe supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioner makes it evidently clear that the respondents alsonoticed the procedural lacuna in the appointment of Inquiry Officer in the case of petitioner. It waspointed out by the Director (Officiating) that the retired Inquiry Officer should be a GovernmentOfficer and should not be more than 70 year of age as 1st July of year of his empanelment. In view ofthe fact that the inquiry officer is a retired employee of O.N.G.C., and is not a government officer, aswell as the fact that he is more than 70 years of age, the inquiry conducted by the said InquiryOfficer is void ab initio.Unknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/7(ii) There has also been violation of principles of natural justice in the instant case. When theinquiry proceedings commenced, the petitioner was languishing in jail. Though it has come in theinquiry report that sufficient opportunity was given to the petitioner to present his case and that anumber of summons were issued to him in the jail through jailor, which he refused to receive, butthe fact remains that at the relevant point of time, the petitioner was in jail. The inquiry proceedingscommenced and were finalized during the said period. Thus, it is established that a reasonableopportunity of hearing was not provided to the petitioner to defend his case. That apart, the orderpassed by the appellate authority is cryptic and non-speaking. While dismissing the appeal, theappellate authority has not recorded any reason whatsoever for arriving at such conclusion. Theappeal has been dismissed by the appellate authority in a very cursory and mechanical manner.Thus, on this count also, inquiry report is liable to be set aside.(iii) The departmental proceedings were initiated against the petitioner in respect of the charges ofmolestation which were framed on the basis of a complaints made by two students of the Institute.One complainant, who filed the alleged complaint, and because of whom the so-called incidents ofmolestation, came before the Principal, did not participate in the inquiry. He neither appeared norhis statements were recorded before the Inquiry Officer. This victim was a very vital witness in theinquiry but he was not examined and the reason shown for his non-examination in the inquiry wasthat he has left the school and has joined some other institute, though in the criminal proceedingwhich was running parallel with the departmental proceeding, he appeared for the trial court andhis statements were recorded. Non-examination of material witness would draw an adverseinference that the department has withheld vital witness of the case, for the reasons best known tothem. Insofar as other witnesses are concerned, they are departmental witnesses and have deposedat the behest of the department. They cannot be said to be independent witnesses. This veryimportant aspect of the matter was not taken into consideration by the Inquiry Officer and theInquiry Officer, in a very arbitrary manner, has held the petitioner guilty for the charges levelledagainst him. Punishment of removal from service of an employee has serious consequences as itaffects the fundamental rights of livelihood of a workman. Thus, besides the in- competency of theinquiry officer to conduct the inquiry, the non-examination of the material witness in the inquiry,has also vitiated the inquiry.(iv) The departmental proceedings and the criminal proceedings were initiated against thepetitioner on the same set of facts and charges. In both the proceedings, charges levelled against thepetitioner were that the petitioner molested two students of the Institute. In the criminalproceeding, the petitioner has been acquitted honorably by the trial court. The learned trial court,after discussing all the evidences in detail, has recorded a categorical finding that there are seriouscontradictions in the statements of the witnesses who appeared before the court and in thedepartmental inquiry. Besides this, there are contradictory versions of the witnesses regarding thefact as to who was first informed by the victims about the said molestation. The trial court, on theexamination of the witnesses came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proved the guiltalleged against the petitioner beyond any reasonable doubt and acquitted the petitioner by hisjudicial pronouncement with the finding that the charge has not been proved. By the judgment andorder of the trial court, the petitioner has been acquitted honorably. He has been completelyexonerated of the charges levelled against him, which are also the same in the departmentalUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/8proceedings. In a catena of decisions, it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that normallywhere the accused is acquitted honorably and completely exonerated of the charge, it would not beexpedient to continue a departmental proceeding on the very same charges or ground or evidence.In the case at hand, the respondents have wrongly interpreted the conduct rules in the instant case.(v) In Union of India v. Naman Singh, (2008) 4 SCC 1, Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-"35. It is not a case where a mere benefit of doubt had been given to the respondentin the criminal proceeding. The criminal court has given a positive finding that theprosecution has not been able to prove that the accused had misappropriated thegoods. His visit to the border for discharging his duties did not tantamount to misuseof the post or the authority. No evidence has been presented that he did not have theauthority to got the border side on official duties and even the Department had notforbidden him from going to that place. It was held that as misappropriation of theproperty has not been proved, the question of any criminal conspiracy did not arise.No evidence had been adduced to bring home the charge of criminal conspiracy,which is an independent crime.37. In Sawai Singh vs. State of Rajasthan : (1986) 3 SCC 454 this Court opined :-"16. But in a departmental enquiry entailing consequences like loss of job whichnow-a-days means loss of livelihood, there must be fair play in action, in respect of anorder involving adverse or penal consequences against an employee, there must beinvestigations to the charges consistent with the requirement of the situation inaccordance with the principles of natural justice in so far as these are applicable in aparticular situation.17. The application of those principles of natural justice must always be in conformitywith the scheme of the Act and the subject matter of the case. It is not possible to laydown any rigid rules as to which principle of natural justice is to be applied. There isno such thing as technical natural justice. The requirements of natural justice dependupon the facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of the enquiry, the rulesunder which the Tribunal is acting, the subject matter to be dealt with and so on.Concept of fair play in action which is the basis of natural justice must depend uponthe particular lis between the parties."(vi) In G.M. Tank vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. (2006) 5 SCC 446, Hon'ble SupremeCourt inter alia held in para 29 & 30 as follows:-"30. The judgments relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the respondentsare distinguishable on facts and on law. In this case, the departmental proceedingsand the criminal case are based on identical and similar set of facts and the charge ina departmental case against the appellant and the charge before criminal court areone and the same. It is true that the nature of charge in the departmental proceedingsUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/9and in the criminal case is grave. The nature of the case launched against theappellant on the basis of evidence and material collected against him during enquiryand investigation and as reflected in the charge sheet, factors mentioned are one andthe same. In other words, charges, evidence, witnesses and circumstances are oneand the same. In the present case, criminal and departmental proceedings havealready noticed or granted on the same set of facts namely, raid conducted at theapplicant's residence recovery of the articles therefrom. The Investigation Officer,Mr. V. B. Raval and other departmental witnesses were the only witnesses examinedby the Enquiry Officer who by relying upon their statement come to the conclusionthat the charges were established the applicant. The same witnesses were examinedin the criminal case and the criminal court on the examination came to theconclusion that the prosecution has not proved the guilt alleged against the appellantbeyond any reasonable doubt and acquitted the appellant by his judicialpronouncement with the finding that the charge has not been proved. It is also to benoticed that the judicial pronouncement was made after a regular trial and on hotcontest.Under these circumstances, it would be unjust and unfair and rather oppressive toallow the findings recorded in the departmental proceedings to stand.31. In our opinion, such facts and evidence in the departmental as well as criminal proceedings werethe same without their being any iota of difference, the appellant should succeed. The distinctionwhich is usually proved between the departmental and criminal proceedings on the basis of theapproach and burden of proof would not be applicable in the instant case. Though the findingrecorded in the domestic enquiry was found to be valid by the courts below, when there was anhonourable acquittal of the employee during the pendency of the proceedings challenging thedismissal, the same requires to be taken note of and the decision in Paul Anthony case will apply.We, therefore, hold that the appeal filed by the appellant deserves to be allowed."(vii) In M. Paul Anthony v. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. (1999) 3 SCC 679, Hon'ble Supreme Court hasheld in paragraph 34 as under:-"34. There is yet another reason for discarding the whole of the case of therespondents. As pointed out earlier, the criminal case as also the departmentalproceedings were based on identical set of facts, namely, 'the raid conducted at theappellant's residence and recovery of incriminating articles therefrom.' The findingsrecorded by the Inquiry Officer, a copy of which has been placed before us, indicatethat the charges framed against the appellant were sought to be proved by PoliceOfficers and Panch witnesses, who had raided the house of the appellant and hadeffected recovery. They were the only witnesses examined by the Inquiry Officer andthe Inquiry Officer, relying upon their statements, came to the conclusion that thecharges were established against the appellant. The same witnesses were examined inthe criminal case but the court, on a consideration of the entire evidence, came to theconclusion that no search was conducted nor was any recovery made from theUnknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/10residence of the appellant. The whole case of the prosecution was thrown out and theappellant was acquitted. In this situation, therefore, where the appellant is acquittedby a judicial pronouncement with the finding that the "raid and recovery" at theresidence of the appellant were not proved, it would be unjust, unfair and ratheroppressive to allow the findings recorded at the ex- parte departmental proceedings,to stand."(viii) In Inspector General of Police v. S. Samuthiram (2013) 1 SCC 598, the Hon'ble Supreme hasheld that unless the accused has an "honorable acquittal" in their criminal trial, as opposed to anacquittal due to witnesses turning hostile or for technical reasons, the acquittal shall not affect thedecision in the disciplinary proceedings and lead to automatic reinstatement. But the penal statutesgoverning substance or procedure do not allude to an "honourable acquittal". Noticing this, theCourt observed:"Honourable acquittal24. The meaning of the expression "honourable acquittal" came up for considerationbefore this Court in RBI v. Bhopal Singh Panchal. In that case, this Court hasconsidered the impact of Regulation 46(4) dealing with honourable acquittal by acriminal court on the disciplinary proceedings. In that context, this Court held thatthe mere acquittal does not entitle an employee to reinstatement in service, theacquittal, it was held, has to be honourable. The expressions "honourable acquittal","acquitted of blame", "fully exonerated" are unknown to the Code of CriminalProcedure or the Penal Code, which are coined by judicial pronouncements. It isdifficult to define precisely what is meant by the expression "honourably acquitted".When the accused is acquitted after full consideration of prosecution evidence andthat the prosecution had miserably failed to prove the charges levelled against theaccused, it can possibly be said that the accused was honourably acquitted.25. In R.P. Kapur v. Union of India [AIR 1964 SC 787] it was held that even in thecase of acquittal, departmental proceedings may follow where the acquittal is otherthan honourable. In State of Assam v.Raghava Rajgopalachari [1972 SLR 44 (SC)] this Court quoted with approval the views expressed byLord Williams, J. in Robert Stuart Wauchope v. Emperor [ILR (1934) 61 Cal 168] which is asfollows: (Raghava case [1972 SLR 44 (SC)] , SLR p. 47, para 8) "8. ... 'The expression "honourablyacquitted" is one which is unknown to courts of justice. Apparently it is a form of order used incourts martial and other extrajudicial tribunals. We said in our judgment that we accepted theexplanation given by the appellant, believed it to be true and considered that it ought to have beenaccepted by the government authorities and by the Magistrate. Further, we decided that theappellant had not misappropriated the monies referred to in the charge. It is thus clear that theeffect of our judgment was that the appellant was acquitted as fully and completely as it was possiblefor him to be acquitted. Presumably, this is equivalent to what government authorities term"honourably acquitted".'"Unknown vs Ministry Of Social Justice & ... on 12 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117091254/1126. As we have already indicated, in the absence of any provision in the service rules forreinstatement, if an employee is honourably acquitted by a criminal court, no right is conferred onthe employee to claim any benefit including reinstatement. Reason is that the standard of proofrequired for holding a person guilty by a criminal court and the enquiry conducted by way ofdisciplinary proceeding is entirely different. In a criminal case, the onus of establishing the guilt ofthe accused is on the prosecution and if it fails to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt, theaccused is assumed to be innocent. It is settled law that the strict burden of proof required toestablish guilt in a criminal court is not required in a disciplinary proceedings and preponderance ofprobabilities is sufficient. There may be cases where a person is acquitted for technical reasons orthe prosecution giving up other witnesses since few of the other witnesses turned hostile, etc. In thecase on hand the prosecution did not take steps to examine many of the crucial witnesses on theground that the complainant and his wife turned hostile. The court, therefore, acquitted the accusedgiving the benefit of doubt. We are not prepared to say that in the instant case, the respondent washonourably acquitted by the criminal court and even if it is so, he is not entitled to claimreinstatement since the Tamil Nadu Service Rules do not provide so."24. In the light of aforesaid, writ petition is allowed. Impugned orders dated 12.03.2019 and03.07.2019 are hereby quashed.
