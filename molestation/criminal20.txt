The petitioner in the instant writ petition has challenged two orders dated 20th July, 2004 and29th October, 2004 passed in ID No. 144/2003 in case titled Sunil Kumar Vs. M/s DelhiDevelopment Authority by learned Labour Court No. VII. By virtue of the first order, the learnedLabour Court has held that the inquiry which was held against the petitioner was fair, proper and inaccordance with principles of natural justice.2. So far as the award dated 29th October, 2004 is concerned, the learned Labour Court upheld theimposition of punishment of dismissal on the petitioner.3. Briefly stated the facts leading to the filing the present writ are that the petitioner/workman wasemployed as a Sweeper with the respondent/management since January 1980. He worked till 22ndAugust, 1990. On 22nd August, 1990 it was alleged against the petitioner/workman that he tried tomolest one lady officer Ms. Nivedita Pandey who was standing near the window. The petitioner hadcome to the window purportedly trying to close the same on the pretext there being heavy rain andtouched her. Ms. Nivedita Pandey raised an alarm on account of which the petitioner wasapprehended. The defence of the petitioner/workman was, since the window was jammed,therefore, the touching of Ms. Nivedita Pandey was totally accidental and unintentional. Thepetitioner was put under suspension and chargesheet was given and an inquiry was held and theSunil Kumar vs Delhi Development Authority on 4 May, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63857737/1Inquiry Officer came to a conclusion that the charge of molestation is not established against thepetitioner while as the other three charges against him were proved. The petitioner challenged thefinding of the Inquiry Officer before the learned Labour Court by getting a reference made beforethe appropriate government. The learned Labour Court framed an issue whether a fair and a properinquiry was conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice against the petitioner andit handed down a finding against the petitioner. The learned Labour Court recorded four charges inthe inquiry report on the basis of which the inquiry was conducted were as under:(i) Molestation of lady officer named Mrs. Nivedita Pandey by Sh. Sunil during hisduty hours at 3rd Floor, Vikas Minar, near the window in the hall.(ii) The screaming shouts of Mrs. Pandey were heard by some staff members whocame running to the palce of incident.(iii) In the presence of these staff members Sh. Sunil begged for forgiveness for hismisbehavior, misconduct and misdeed.(iv) Sh. Sunil violated the conduct rules by this act and later on absconded from theofficial duty immediately after this incident.4. The learned Labour Court after examining the entire gamut of facts came to the conclusion thatthere is no perversity in the report of the Inquiry Officer or any violation of principle of naturaljustice, accordingly, the issue was decided in favour of the management. By the second order thequestion of quantum of compensation was also decided by the learned Labour Court on 29thOctober, 2004 and it was held that keeping in view the conduct of the petitioner the imposition ofpunishment of dismissal against the petitioner was not disproportionate. The learned Labour Courtalso referred the authorities of the Apex Court in order to take the support that the Courts shouldgenerally not interfere with the quantum of punishment once the charge is proved. Reliance in thisregard was placed in case titled Devender Swami Vs. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation2002 AIR (SC) 2545 and Union of India Vs. Narain Singh 2002 (4) SC 207.5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The contention of the learned counsel for thepetitioner has been two fold, firstly that the petitioner had been employed with therespondent/management since 1980 and had unblemished service record. The incident in questionwas a mere misunderstanding in as much as it was raining outside and the petitioner who tried toclose the window accidently touched the lady officer which was construed as an attempt tomolestation. It was contended that a Sweeper who is a Class-IV employee could hardly make anattempt or think of molesting a superior officer working in the same organization. Keeping in viewthese facts, it was urged that the punishment of dismissal which was imposed on the petitioner wasgrossly disproportionate.6. It was also contended that if one sees the report of the Inquiry Officer the charge of molestation isnot established, and therefore, even on that score also a lenient view ought to be taken andpunishment commensurate with the misconduct ought to have been imposed.Sunil Kumar vs Delhi Development Authority on 4 May, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63857737/27. This was contested by the learned counsel for the respondent who placed reliance on ApparelExport Promotion Council Vs. A. K. Chopra (1999) 1 SCC 759 wherein the Court dealt with a case ofsexual harassment of a female employee of the Council. It was held that while dealing with the caseof a sexual harassment at the work place the Court does not have to consider the sexual assault ormolestation in the manner as if it is dealing with a criminal matter. The case must be dealt withsensitivity and sympathy. The Court had also upheld the order of removal of the petitioner fromservice on the charges of sexual harassment.8. The learned counsel for the petitioner tried to distinguish the facts of the said case on the groundby urging that in the case reported the offender who was alleged to have indulged in sexualharassment was a superior officer and against the victim who was only a typist cum clerk. While asin the instant case the victim was a superior officer and the petitioner was only a Class-IV employee,and therefore, the Class-IV employee could hardly dream of molesting or attempting to molest thevictim, who is far superior in position.9. I have considered the respective submissions of the counsel for the parties and perused therecord. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that merely on account of the factthat he had an unblemished service record for more than a decade did not give him a license toindulge in acts of molestation or conducting himself in a manner which is obviously to create a scarein the minds of female official be that of junior or senior that the offender is trying to outrage hermodesty or is making sexual advances. In the instant case, this is precisely what the petitioner hasdone despite being a Class-IV employee he seemed to have lost his mental balance on account of thefactum of rain and the advantageous position of the female official being alone in the hall he tookliberty of touching under the false pretext closing the window. It could not be said that the status ofthe victim or that of the offender should make any distinction in the imposition of punishment incase of this nature. The offender must dealt with a stern hand so that female officials feel safe atwork place to discharge their duties.10. I, accordingly, feel that the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that thiswas not a case of molestation and the imposition of punishment of dismissal does not hold anywater. The petitioner has shown a criminal bent of mind which deserves to be dealt with stronglyand has been actually dealt with firmly and decisively by imposing a punishment of dismissal onhim. It cannot be said by no stretch of imagination that the punishment of dismissal which has beenimposed on petitioner is disproportionate or highly excessive as a matter of fact imposition ofpunishment other than dismissal will only show misplaced sympathy with the petitioner and willgive impetus to persons with such proclivities to indulge in acts of outraging the modesty of femaleemployees.11. In Apparel Export Promotion Council Vs. A.K. Chopra (1999) 1 SCC 759 the Hon'ble SupremeCourt has laid down the scope of judicial review in following words:"Judicial review, not being an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner inwhich the decision was arrived at, the court, while exercising the power of judicialreview, must remain conscious of the fact that if the decision has been arrived at bySunil Kumar vs Delhi Development Authority on 4 May, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63857737/3the administrative authority after following the principles established by law and therules of natural justice and the individual has received a fair treatment to meet thecase against him, the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of theadministrative authority on a matter which fell squarely within the sphere ofjurisdiction of that authority."12. Therefore, there is no infirmity, illegality, perversity in the impugned orders, and accordingly,the writ petition of the petitioner is without any merit and the same is dismissed.May 4th, 2009                                       V.K.SHALI, J.KPSunil Kumar vs Delhi Development Authority on 4 May, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63857737/4
