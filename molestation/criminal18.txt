It  has   come   in   evidence   that  right from the beginning, the deceased was abusing and molesting his daughter Karishma, which was seen by the  appellant   on   several  occasions.   On  the  night  of  the  incident   as   well,   the   deceased   was   molesting   his  daughter.   When   the  appellant   tried   to   stop   him,   a  scuffle took place and the deceased sustained injuries which turned out to be fatal.

The fact that the deceased used to molest his daughter has come out in the investigation of the Investigating Officer, who is  a   neutral   person.   He   has   also   pointed  out   numerous  contradictions and improvements between the statements of the prosecution witnesses made before him and the  testimonies  given  by  them   in   the  Court,  which   shows  that these prosecution witnesses are not reliable.HC-NIC                              Page 28 of 80     Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017                  R/CR.A/58/2013                                          JUDGMENT41.1   It   is   further   submitted   that   there   are   several  improvements   and   contradictions   in  Karishma   used   to   reside   with   the  complainant.

Mr.J.K.Shah, learned Additional Public Prosecutor judicial  confession   that   she   has   killed   the   deceased   which  aspect   has   emerged   from   the  evidence   of   several  prosecution witnesses. There is evidence that frequent  quarrels   took   place  between   the   deceased   and   the  appellant regarding her coming home late after grazing the goats due to which the deceased used to suspect  her character. 42.1   That almost all the prosecution witnesses have  denied   that  they   have   stated   before  the  Police   that  the appellant had complained to the complainant that  her   husband   used   to   molest  their   daughter   time   and  again and on the night of the incident as well, he had  molested   her.  It   is   submitted   that   looking   to   the  material   on   record,   this   Court   may   maintain   the judgment and order passed by the Trail Court. 43. In   the   background   of   the   above   summary   of evidence and rival submissions, we may now examine the  judgment   under   challenge.   As   can  be   seen   from   the  HC-NIC Page 31 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT evidence on record, some of the Panch witnesses have become hostile. The related witnesses have all deposed  in   favour   of   the   prosecution.   Certain  factors   have  weighed   with   the   Trial   Court   in   arriving   at   its conclusion, which can be briefly summarized as below :daughter, would not give false testimony against  her   mother,   the   appellant.   The   Trial   Court  has  found   that   the   testimony   of   Karishma   is  trustworthy and there is no reason to discard it. nothing helpful to the appellant has emerged. The  Trial   Court   has   held   that   normally,   no  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/14child  would give testimony against her parents and the very fact that Karishma has deposed against the  appellant proves the guilt of the appellant.10,   the  injuries sustained by the deceased, as described in Column Nos.17 and 18 of the Postmortem Report  HC-NIC Page 32 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 2104:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT could have been caused by the weapon of offence.Dr.Durgesh  Avdheshkumar.   It   has   taken   note   of   the   aspect  that   the   doctor   has   stated  that   the   appellant  told   him   not   to   treat   the   deceased   and   if   he does so, she would file a case against him. From  the   above,   the   Trial   Court   has   derived   the conclusion   that   the   appellant   had   nursed   an  intention   of   killing   the   deceased,   meaning thereby, that the murder of the deceased was a  premeditated one by the appellant.1, 7, 8, 10 and 13.(v)  The Trial Court has not believed the plea of the  appellant that the incident took place during a scuffle  that ensued  when the  appellant  saw the  deceased   molesting   their   daughter   Karishma  at  night.   On   the   contrary,   the   learned   Judge   has  opined   that   there   must   have   been   a  quarrel  HC-NIC Page 33 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013JUDGMENT between the accused and the deceased due to the  "bad   character"   of   the   appellant,    because   of  which the appellant hit the deceased on the head  with   the   weapon   of   offence.  According   to   the  learned Judge, the appellant has introduced the story regarding the molestation of her daughter  by   the   deceased   in   order   to   save   herself.  The  learned  Judge  has  further  held that  the Police  investigation   does   not   support   this  theory   and  no   evidence   has   been   produced   on   record  regarding this aspect.(vi)   Broadly on the basis of the above conclusions,  the Trial Court has convicted the appellant for the   offence   of   murder   and   sentenced   her   to  undergo life imprisonment.44. Before   this   Court   enters   into   a   discussion regarding the above findings, it would be pertinent to  advert   to   the   judgments   relied   upon   by  the   learned  advocate for the appellant.45.

Even   in   that   case   the   law  has   been  laid down as under: (SCC p.458, para 29)"29. ... The intention to cause death can be   gathered   generally   from   a  combination   of   a   few   or   several   of   the   following,   among  other,  circumstances:   (i)   nature   of   the  weapon   used;   (ii)   whether   the   weapon  was  carried by the accused or was picked up from  the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at  a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of  force   employed   in   causing   injury;   (v)  whether the act was in the course of sudden  quarrel   or   sudden   fight   or   free  for   all  HC-NIC Page 35 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT fight;   (vi)   whether   the   incident   occurs   by  chance   or   whether   there   was   any   premeditation;   (vii)   whether   there   was  any  prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave  and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause  for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in  the heat of passion; (x) whether the person  inflicting   the   injury   has   taken  undue   advantage   or   has   acted   in   a   cruel   and   unusual   manner;   (xi)  whether   the   accused  dealt   a   single   blow   or   several   blows.   The  above   list  of   circumstances   is,   of   course,   not   exhaustive   and   there   may   be   several other   special   circumstances   with   reference to individual cases which may throw light on   the question of intention". and  Gali Venkataiah v. State of A.P. 14.  It is not the case even in any of the dying   declarations   that   the   appellant   had  premeditated  or   preplanned   his   actions   or  was   having   any   information   prior   to   the  incident   that  the   deceased   would   be   found  with   his   sister   Sandhya   at   the   place   of  occurrence.   Their  meeting   might   have   been  taken   by   the   appellant   as   temerity.

By no means, can it be held to be a case of premeditation."46. The next judgment relied upon is that in the case  of  Saroj   @   Suraj   Panchal   Vs.   State   of  West   Bengal  (supra),  wherein,   on   the   facts   of   that   case,   the Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/16Supreme Court has held as below :"8.  It is not in dispute that there was a love   affair   between   Bandana   Panchal  and   Sukumar  Ray   and   it   was   not   liked   by   the   family   members   of  Bandana   Panchal.   On   the   occurrence night at about 8.00 p.m. Sukumar Ray went to the house of Bandana Panchal to  meet her. Annoyed   by   the   presence   of   Sukumar   Ray   in  the night in their house the appellants and other   accused   persons   beat   Sukumar   Ray   and   dragged   him   from   the   first   floor   to   the ground floor through wooden staircase which  resulted in injuries. Nobody would tolerate  such   an  intruder   into   their   house   in   the  night hours. By no means, can it be held to  be a case of premeditation and it was a case  of   grave   and   sudden   provocation   and   would come   under   the   First   Exception   to   Section  300   IPC.   The   fact   situation   bears   great similarity   to   that   in   the   decisions   in  Mangesh   vs.   State   of   Maharashtra   [JT   2011 HC-NIC Page 37 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT(1)   SC   15:   (2011)   2   SCC   123]   and   State   of   Punjab vs. Jagtar Singh & Ors. [JT 2011 (8) SC 300: (2011) 14 SCC 678].9.  Looking at the nature of injuries sustained  by   the   deceased   and   the   circumstances   as enumerated   above   it   can   be   concluded   that  the   death   was   caused   by   the   acts   of   the  appellants/accused   done   with   the   intention  of causing  such bodily  injury as is likely  to   cause  death   and   therefore   the   offence  would squarely come within the first part of  Section 304 IPC and the appellants would be  liable to be convicted for the said offence.   The  conviction   of   the   appellants/accused  nos.1   and   3   under   Section   302   read   with Section 34 IPC is liable to be set aside.47. The  judgment  in  the   case  of  Kala   @   Chandrakala  Vs.   State   (supra),judicial confession purported to have been made by the  appellant.   The   relevant   extract   of   the  judgment   is  reproduced hereinbelow:judicial confession which is a weak kind of  evidence,   inspire   the   confidence.

She came in search of his brother Murugesan   to   the   house   of   the   deceased.  Murugesan   has   told   her   on  12.5.2005   that  appellant had  threatened to kill him as he was habitual of consuming alcohol. When she  did   not   receive   any   telephone   call  for   15  days   from   the   deceased,   she   went   to   his village. On enquiry she was informed by the appellant that she, her nephew Prakasam and  father   murdered   the   deceased   and  threw   his   body   under   the   bridge.   Susheela,   P.W.4  further   stated   that   the  appellant   touched  her   legs   and   stated   that   she   would   give Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/17properties of her father to two children and   that   she   should   not   inform   the  police.  Thereafter, P.W.4 went to the police station   on   the   same   day   and  lodged   the   complaint  Ex.P2.

She has further stated to have gone   to   police   station   after   5   days  stated   that   she  had   signed   the   agreement   for   sale   of   land executed by the accused. It is apparent that   accused   was   not   having   good  relationship  with   Susheela,   PW.4.   Making   confession   to  such   an   inimical  person   is   most   unlikely. When the witness had gone in search of the  deceased to the house of the accused it is  HC-NIC Page39 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT most   unlikely  that   the   confessional  statement would be made to her readily. It  is   not   that   the   appellant  had   gone   to   the  house   of   P.W.4   to   make   the   confession.   On  the   other   hand   query  was   made   by   the   daughter of the deceased to Susheela, P.W.4  as   to   the   whereabouts   of   the  deceased,  meaning   thereby   the   whereabouts   of   the  deceased   were   not   known   even   to  his  daughter.   In   case   the   deceased   had   been  killed   in   the   house,   perhaps   the   daughter would   have   known   about   the   offence   having  been committed by the accused. 7.

In Aloke nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal (2007) 12 SCC 230 it has been observed that  the main features of confession are required  to be verified. In Sansar Chand v.

The question that falls for determination before this Court is whether, on the basis of the evidence on  record,   the   Trial   Court   has   arrived   at  premeditated one.49. In   order   to   examine   this   aspect,   it   would   be  fruitful   to   advert   to   the   provisions   ofexcepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act   by   which   the   death   is   caused   If it is done with the intention of  causing such bodily injury as the offender knows  HC-NIC Page 42 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013injury   to   any   person   and   the  bodily   injury   intended   to   be   inflicted   is  If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must,  in   all   probability,   cause   death  or   such   bodily  injury as is likely to cause death, and commits  such   act   without  any   excuse   for   incurring   the   risk   of   causing   death   or   such   injury   as  aforesaid." 50. As can be seen from the above, culpable homicide amounts to murder only if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/19or bodily injury as described in "Secondly", "Thirdly"  and   "Fourthly".   Certain   exceptions   have  been   carved  out   to   this   section   which   illustrate   under   what  circumstances   culpable  with culpable homicide which does not amount to murder if it is committed without premeditation, in a sudden  quarrel. The said exception reads as below :   it is committed without premeditation in a sudden   HC-NIC Page 43 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 2104:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT fight   in   the   heat   of   passion   upon   a  sudden  quarrel   and   without   the   offender   having   taken  undue   advantage   or   acted   in   a  cruel   or   unusual  manner.""304.

At this stage, it would be pertinent to examine  the   necessary   ingredients   that   must   be  found   to   be  HC-NIC Page 44 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013recent   judgment   in   the   case   of  Surain  Singh   v.   State   of   Punjab,  reported in  (2017)   5  SCC 796.  The   relevant   extract   of   the   judgment   is  reproduced hereinbelow :"13. Exception 4 to Section 300 of the IPC applies   in the absence of any premeditation. This is very clear from the wordings of the Exception   itself.   The   exception   contemplates   that   the  sudden   fight   shall   start   upon   the   heat   of  passion   on   a   sudden   quarrel.   The   Fourth  Exception to Section 300 IPC covers acts done   in a sudden fight. The said Exception  deals  with a case of provocation not covered by the   First Exception, after which its place would  have been more appropriate. The Exception is   founded upon the same principle, for in both  there is absence of premeditation. But, while   in   the   case   of   Exception   1   there   is   total  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/20 which  clouds   men's  sober   reason  and   urges   them   to   deeds   which   they   would   not  otherwise   do.  There   is   provocation   in  Exception 4 as in Exception 1, but the injury  HC-NICPage 45 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT done   is  not   the   direct   consequence   of   that   provocation. In fact, Exception 4 deals with  cases   in  which   notwithstanding   that   a   blow  may   have   been   struck,   or   some   provocation  given   in  the   origin   of   the   dispute   or   in  whatever way the quarrel may have originated,   yet   the  subsequent   conduct   of   both   parties  puts them in respect of guilt upon an equal   footing.   A  "sudden   fight"   implies   mutual  provocation   and   blows   on   each   side.   The   homicide  committed   is   then   clearly   not  traceable   to   unilateral   provocation,   nor could in such cases the whole blame be placed   on one side. For if it were so, the Exception  more  appropriately   applicable   would   be  Exception   1.   There   is   no   previous  deliberation   or  determination   to   fight.   A  fight   suddenly   takes   place,   for   which   both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may  be   that   one   of   them   starts   it,   but   if   the  other  had   not   aggravated   it   by   his   own  conduct   it   would   not   have   taken   the   serious  turn it did. There is then mutual provocation  and   aggravation,   and   it   is   difficult   to   apportion  the   share   of   blame   which   attaches   to each fighter. 14. The   help   of   Exception   4   can   be   invoked   if   death   is   caused   (a)   without  premeditation,  (b)   in   a   sudden   fight,   (c)     without   the   offenders   having   taken   undue   advantage   or  HC-NIC Page 46 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENTacted  in a cruel or unusual manner, and (d)  the   fight   must   have   been   with   the   person  killed.   To   bring   a   case   within   Exception   4  all the ingredients  mentioned  in it must be  found.   It   is   to   be   noted   that   the   "fight"   occurring  in Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC  is not defined in IPC. It takes two to make   a fight. Heat of passion requires that there   must   be  no   time   for   the   passions   to   cool   down   and   in   this   case,   the   parties   had  worked themselves  into a fury on account of   the   verbal   altercation   in   the   beginning.   A  fight  is   a   combat   between   two   and   more   persons  whether  with  or  without  weapons.  It   is   not  possible   to   enunciate   any   general   rule   as   to   what   shall   be   deemed   to   be   a  sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and   whether   a   quarrel   is   sudden   or   not   must  necessarily  depend  upon  the  proved  facts  of   each  case.  For  the  application  of Exception   4,  it   is   not   sufficient   to   show   that   there   was   a   sudden   quarrel   and   there   was   no  premeditation. It must further be shown that   the   offender   has   not   taken   undue   advantage  or   acted   in   a   cruel   or   unusual   manner.   The   expression  "undue  advantage"  as  used  in the   provision means "unfair advantage".15. In  State of A.P.  vs.  Rayavarapu Punnayya and  Another  (1976)   4   SCC   382,   this   Court  while  drawing a distinction between Section 302 and  HC-NIC Page 47 of 80 Created On Mon Aug21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENTPenal   Code,  "culpable homicide" is genus and "murder"   its   specie.   All   "murder"   is   "culpable characteristics   of   murder",   is  "culpable   homicide   not   amounting   to  murder".   For   the  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/21purpose   of   fixing  punishment,   proportionate   to   the   gravity  of   this   generic   offence,   the  Code  practically   recognises   three   degrees   of  culpable homicide. The first is, what may  be  called,   "culpable   homicide   of   the  first degree". This is the greatest form  of culpable homicide, which is defined in   Section   300   as   "murder".   The  second  may  be  termed   as   "culpable   homicide   of   the  second degree".  This is punishable  under  the   first   part  of   Section   304.   Then,  there is "culpable homicide of the third   degree".   This   is   the   lowest  type   of  culpable   homicide   and   the   punishment  provided   for   it   is,   also,   the   lowest among   the   punishments   provided   for   the   three   grades.   Culpable   homicide   of   this  degree  is   punishable   under   the   second  part of Section 304.*  *  *21. From   the   above   conspectus,   it   emerges  that whenever a court is confronted with  the  question   whether   the   offence   is  "murder"   or   "culpable   homicide   not  amounting   to  murder",   on   the  facts  of  a  case,   it   will   be   convenient   for   it   to  approach the problem in three stages. The  question   to   be   considered   at   the   first  stage   would  be,   whether   the   accused   has   done an act by doing which he has caused  the   death   of  another.   Proof   of   such  causal connection between the act of the  HC-NIC Page 48 of 80 CreatedOn Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT accused   and   the   death,   leads  to   the  second stage for considering whether that   act   of   the   accused   amounts   to   "culpable homicide"   as   defined   in   Section   299.   If  the   answer   to   this   question   is   prima facie found in the affirmative, the stage  for considering the operation of Section  300   of   the  Penal   Code,   is   reached.   This  is   the   stage   at   which   the   court   should determine whether the facts proved by the  prosecution   bring   the   case   within   the ambit of any of the four clauses of the  definition   of   "murder"   contained   in  Section   300.   If  the   answer   to   this  question   is   in   the   negative   the   offence  would be "culpable homicide not amounting  to murder", punishable under the first or  the  second part   of   Section   304,  depending,   respectively,   on   whether   the second or the third clause of Section 299   is applicable. If this question is found  in   the   positive,  but   the   case   comes  within   any   of   the   exceptions   enumerated  in   Section   300,   the  offence   would   still   be   "culpable   homicide   not   amounting   to murder", punishable under the first part   of Section 304, of the Penal Code.""                           (emphasis supplied)53. The above principles of law has also been dealt with by the Supreme Court in another recent judgment  in   the   case   of  Arjun   and   another   v.  State   of  Chattisgarh,  reported   in  (2017)   3   SCC   247.  After  taking   into   consideration   the  relevant   case   laws   on  this point, the Supreme Court has held thus : "20.To invoke this Exception 4, the requirements   that are to be fulfilled have been laid down   by   this  Court   in   Surinder   Kumar   vs.   UT,  HC-NIC Page 49 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT Chandigarh   -   (1989)2   SCC   217,   it   has   been  explained as under: (SCC p.220, para 7) "7.To invoke this exception four requirements  must   be  satisfied,   namely,   (i)   it   was   a   sudden   fight;   (ii)   there   was   no Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/22premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a  heat of passion; and (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a   cruel manner. The cause of the quarrel is not relevant nor is it relevant who offered  the provocation or started the assault. The  number   of  wounds   caused   during   the  occurrence   is   not   a   decisive   factor   but  what   is   important   is  that   the   occurrence   must   have   been   sudden   and   unpremeditated and the offender must have acted in a fit  of anger. Of course, the offender must not have taken any undue advantage or acted in  a cruel manner. Where, on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment picks up  a   weapon   which   is   handy   and   causes  injuries,  one   of   which   proves   fatal,   he  would   be   entitled   to   the   benefit   of   this  exception  provided   he   has   not   acted  cruelly." 21. Further in Arumugam vs. State - (2008)15 SCC  590,   in   support   of   the   proposition   of   law that under what circumstances Exception 4 to   Section   300   IPC   can   be   invoked   if   death   is caused, it has been explained as under: (SCC  p.596, para 9)  "9....   '18.   The   help   of   Exception   4  can   be   invoked   if   death   is   caused   (a)   without  premeditation;   (b)   in   a   sudden   fight;  (c)   without   the   offender's   having   taken   undue  advantage   or   acted   in   a   cruel   or  unusual   manner; and (d) the fight must have been with   the   person   killed.   To   bring   a   case  within   Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in   it must be found. It is to be noted that the  "fight"   occurring   in   Exception   4   to   Section  HC-NIC Page 50 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 2104:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT 300   IPC   is   not   defined   in   the   Penal  Code,  1860. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of   passion requires that there must be no time  for  the   passions   to   cool   down   and   in   this  case, the parties had worked themselves into  a fury on account of the verbal altercation  in the beginning. A fight is a combat between  two and more persons whether with or without  weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be   a   sudden   quarrel.   It   is   a   question   of   fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must  necessarily   depend   upon   the   proved   facts   of each   case.   For   the   application   of   Exception   4,   it   is   not   sufficient   to   show   that   there was   a   sudden   quarrel   and   there   was   no  premeditation. It must further be shown that  the offender has not taken undue advantage or  acted   in   cruel   or   unusual   manner.   The  expression   "undue   advantage"   as   used   in   the  provision means 'unfair advantage'."" 22. The accused, as per the version of PW 6 and  eyewitness   account   of   other   witnesses,   had weapons   in   their   hands,   but   the   sequence   of  events   that   have   been   narrated   by   the witnesses   only   show   that   the   weapons   were  used during altercation in a sudden fight and suggest that appellants have not taken "undue  advantage"   or   acted   in   a   cruel   manner.  Therefore, in the fact situation, Exception 4  under   Section   300   IPC   is   attracted.   The  incident took place in a sudden fight as such   the   appellants   are   entitled   to   the   benefit under Section 300 Exception 4 IPC.Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/23HC-NIC                             Page 51 of 80     Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017                   R/CR.A/58/2013                                          JUDGMENT23.

Injuries/incised   wound   caused   on   the   head  i.e. right parietal region and right temporal  region  and   also   occipital   region,   the  injuries   indicate   that   the   appellants   had intention and knowledge to cause the injuries  and   thus   it   would   be   a   case   falling   under Section 304 Part I IPC.

"6. For bringing in operation Exception 4 to  Section 300 IPC it has to be established that  the act was committed without premeditation,   in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel without the offender having   taken undue advantage and not having acted in  a cruel or unusual manner.   7. The   Fourth   Exception   of   Section   300   IPC   covers acts done in a sudden fight. The said  Exception   deals   with   a   case   of   prosecution  not   covered   by   the   First   Exception,   after  which   its   place   would   have   been   more  appropriate.   The   Exception   is   founded   upon  the  same   principle,   for   in   both   there   is  absence   of   premeditation.   But,   while   in   the  case  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/24is   only   that   heat   of  passion which clouds men's sober reasons and   urges   them   to   deeds  which   they   would   not  otherwise   do.   There   is   provocation   in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury   done   is   not   the   direct   consequence   of   that provocation.   In   fact   Exception   4   deals   with  cases   in   which   notwithstanding   that   a  blow  may   have   been   struck,   or   some   provocation   given   in   the   origin   of   the   dispute   or  in  whatever way the quarrel may have originated,  yet   the   subsequent   conduct   of   both  parties  puts   them   in   respect   of   guilt   upon   equal  HC-NIC Page 53 of 80 Created On MonAug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT footing.   A   `sudden   fight'   implies  mutual  provocation   and   blows   on   each   side.   The   homicide   committed   is   then   clearly  not   traceable   to   unilateral   provocation,   nor   in  such cases could the whole blame be placed on  one   side.   For   if   it   were   so,   the   exception  more   appropriately   applicable   would   be Exception   1.   There   is   no   previous  deliberation   or   determination   to   fight.   A  fight  suddenly   takes   place,   for   which   both  parties are more or less to be blamed. It may  be   that  one   of   them   starts   it,   but   if   the  other   had   not   aggravated   it   by   his   own  conduct   it would   not  have   taken  the  serious  turn it did. There is then mutual provocation   and  aggravation,   and   it   is   difficult   to   apportion   the   share   of   blame   which   attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can   be   invoked   if   death   is   caused:   (a)   without premeditation;   (b)   in   a   sudden   fight;   (c)   without   the   offender's   having   taken   undue advantage   or   acted   in   a   cruel   or   unusual  manner; and (d) the fight must have been with   the  person   killed.   To   bring   a   case   within  Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in  it must be found. It is to be noted that the   `fight'   occurring   in   Exception   4   to   Section 300 IPC is not defined in the IPC. It takes  two to make a fight. Heat of passion requires  that there must be no time for the passions  to   cool   down   and   in   this   case,   the   parties HC-NIC Page 54 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENThave worked themselves into a fury on account   of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A   fight  is   a   combat   between   two   and   more  persons   whether   with   or   without   weapons.   It is not possible to enunciate any general rule   as   to   what   shall   be   deemed   to   be   a   sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether   a  quarrel  is  sudden  or  not  must   necessarily depend   upon   the   proved   facts   of   each   case.  For the application of Exception 4, it is not  sufficient   to   show   that   there   was   a   sudden  quarrel   and   there   was   no   premeditation.   It must   further  be  shown  that  the  offender  has  not  taken  undue  advantage  or  acted  in  cruel  or  unusual   manner.   The   expression   `undue  advantage'   as   used   in   the   provision   means  `unfair advantage'.These   aspects   have   been   highlighted   in   Dhirajbhai   Gorakhbhai   Nayak   v.   State   of  Gujarat   -   (2003)9   SCC   322,   Parkash   Chand   v. (2007)11 SCC 218 and Hawa Singh v. State of   Haryana - (2009)3 SCC 411." Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/2555. After carefully analyzing the above principles of law enunciated by the Supreme Court, we can enumerate the factors that are required to be present for the  HC-NIC Page 55 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21IPC,   as  follows :(i) There must be a sudden fight.(ii) There must be no premeditation.(iii) The act must be done in the heat of passion.(iv) The assailant must not have taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner.56. As stated in  Surinder Kumar vs. UT, Chandigarh,  reported in  (1989) 2 SCC 217, which has been quoted  by the Supreme Court in Arjun and another v. State of Chattisgarh   (supra),  the   number   of   wounds   caused during the occurrence is not a decisive factor. What  is   important   is   that   the   occurrence   must  have   been  sudden and unpremeditated and the offender must have acted in a fit of anger. Where, on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of the passion of the moment, picks  up   a   weapon   which   is   handy   and  provided he has not acted with cruelty.57. In Arumugam vs. State, reported in (2008) 15 SCC  590,  also referred to in  Arjun and another v. State  of   Chattisgarh   (supra),  it   has   been   held   that   to  HC-NIC Page 56 of 80 Created On4, all the ingredients  mentioned in it must be found. Though the word "fight" in the IPC, it takes two to make a fight. It remains a  question   to   be   judged   on   the   facts   of  each   case  whether the fight was such that took place due to a sudden quarrel where the person concerned lost his or  her   cool,   in   the   heat   of   passion   and  inflicted   the  blows. 58. If all of the above ingredients are present in a  given   fact   situation,   the   case   would   fall  only a case of knowledge and not of intention to cause  murder   or   bodily   injury,   the   same  59. The facts of the present case are required to be minutely examined in light of the above provisions and  principles   of   law.   There   is   no   doubt  regarding   the  fact that the deceased died due to injuries inflicted  by   the   appellant.   Whether  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/26the   act   committed   by   the  HC-NIC Page 57 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT appellant is murder or culpable homicide not amounting  to  murder,   is   the   crucial   question   that   arises   for  determination.   Whether   the   appellant  inflicted   blows  with   a   premeditated   mind   or   whether   they   were  inflicted   without   any  premeditation   or   intention   to  kill, in a sudden fight that took place in the heat of equilibrium   after  seeing the deceased molesting their own daughter, is  required   to   be  determined   from   the   facts   and  circumstances   of   the   present   case.   The   difference between murder and culpable homicide not amounting to  murder   is   a   very   thin   but   vital    the   correct   nature   of   the  case,  upon   which   would   depend  the     conviction   under the correct provision and the appropriate sentence.60. The law requires that proper and just punishment be awarded to an accused on the basis of the offence committed. The punishment would naturally depend upon the nature of the conviction of the accused under a  particular   provision.   Though   there   can   be  no   doubt  HC-NIC Page 58 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013she   ought   to   be   punished  appropriately.   Appropriate   punishment   for   the appropriate offence is the mandate of the law. There can be no generalization on this aspect and each case  would turn upon its own fact situation. Officer, who is a neutral person with no axe to grind examination that it has emerged in his investigation that the deceased often used to molest his daughter, who is also the daughter of the appellant, by raising her lungi. The incident took place due to this act of  the   deceased.   He   has   clearly   stated   that  his  investigation   has   revealed   that   it   is   due   to   the frequent molestation of her daughter by the deceased, which also took place on the fateful night, that the examination   of  this   witness   that   several   of   the   prosecution  witnesses,   mostly   the   related  ones   have,   in   their  statements   before  him   at   the   initial   point   of   time,  disclosed   this  aspect.

When Karishma was asleep, the deceased used to raise her lungi and  physically   molest   her.   This   witness   has  stated   that  the appellant told him that she had seen this with her  own eyes twice or thrice.Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/277, brother of the deceased, had also disclosed the same thing before him and had stated that this fact 7 had further stated that  the complainant had informed him and another person by the name of Jitsing about this complaint made by the  appellant   by   calling   them   home.   The  statement that on the day of the incident the accused  told   him   that   she   was   sleeping   at   night  with   her  daughter Karishma when the deceased covered Karishma's  mouth and she awoke.HC-NIC                              Page 60 of 80     Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017                  R/CR.A/58/2013                                          JUDGMENT8, Samimbanu, had also  stated before him that on asking the accused regarding  the   incident,   she  had   disclosed   that   at   about   4.00  a.m., when the appellant and Karishma were sleeping,  the  deceased   got   up   and   started   molesting   their  daughter   Karishma   which   was   seen   by   the  appellant.  This   witness   has   further   stated   that   even   prior   to  this   incident,   the    Karishma's   lungi   when   she   was   sleeping   at  night and try to molest her.64. The   Investigating   Officer,   in   his   testimony   has at length referred to the statement made by Karishma before him. As per his deposition Karishma had stated before him that when she was sleeping at night, her  father,   the   deceased,   covered   her   face.  She   started  shouting for her mother, the appellant, who awoke and admonished the deceased as to what he was doing. The Investigating Officer has further stated that Karishma had stated before him that the deceased used to nurse  HC-NIC Page 61 of 80 Created On Mon Aug21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENTa false suspicion regarding the appellant and quarrel  with her. 65. Karishma   had   further   stated   before   the  Investigating   Officer   that   when   she   was  studying   in  the   7th  Standard,   the   deceased   used   to   sleep   in   the bed with her but she does not know what he used to do  with   her.   She   has   further   stated   that  "I   do   not  remember what my father did after raising his lungi, as I was asleep and I am not aware whether my mother  saw it or not".Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/2866. The Investigating Officer has further stated that Karishma did not state before him that in spite of her  telling   the   appellant   not   to   hit   her  father,   the  appellant continued to do so. the appellant, while denying the allegations against her, has stated that "I have not killed the deceased but he may have got injured in a scuffle. The deceased was sleeping on my daughter. I have not committed any offence. A false case has been foisted upon me and I  am   innocent."   Thus,   she   appears   to   have  stated   the  true genesis of the incident, which the other related  HC-NIC Page 62 of 80 Created OnMon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENTprosecution witnesses have tried to suppress.68. The   prosecution   witnesses   whose   initial statements have been referred to by the Investigating Officer in his testimony, including Karishma, appear  to   have   resiled   from   their   earlier  statements   and  deposed against the appellant in Court. None of them have accepted their initial versions that the incident took place due to a quarrel at about 4.00 a.m. when  the   appellant   awoke   and   saw   the  deceased   molesting  their  daughter  Karishma.   None  of  them   have   stood   by  their   earlier  statements   that   the   appellant   had  complained   about   the   behavior   of   the   deceased   with their   daughter   about   three   months   prior   to   the 1, 7 and 8,  who are family members of the deceased, resiled from 9, Karishma, to protect whom the  accused   appears   to   have   inflicted   the   blows   on   the deceased,   has   also   retracted   from   her   earlier   stand  before   the   Investigating   Officer.   On  the   contrary,  Karishma has denied her earlier statement before the  HC-NIC Page 63 of 80 CreatedOn Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENTdenied   that   her  father   molested   her   on   the   fateful   night   and   her  mother   got   enraged,  due   to   which   the   incident   took  place. 69. The truth, however, has the intrinsic quality of  emerging   in   some   form   or   the   other,  however   much   a  witness   may   have   been   tutored.   Karishma   has   stated that on the night of the incident her mother had gone to sleep at 10:00 p.m. Karishma, her father and her  younger   brother   Samir   were   sitting   and  watching  television.   Thereafter,   they   put   off   the   lights   and went to sleep. Karishma states that she was sleeping with the appellant and her younger brother Samir was  sleeping   with   the   deceased,   in   the  same   room.   From  this statement, it is clear that the accused had gone to sleep at 10:00 p.m. while Karishma and the deceased were watching television. There is no contradiction to Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/29this at all. The appellant, therefore, would obviously have no knowledge of what would occur later at night as she had unsuspectingly gone to sleep while Karishma  and   the   deceased   were   still   awake  and   watching  HC-NIC Page 64 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013JUDGMENT television. Karishma has stated that she was sleeping  with   her   mother.   In   such   a  situation,   when   the  deceased   came   to   the   bed   where   Karishma   and   the  appellant   were  sleeping   and   covered   Karishma's   face and when Karishma made a sound which awoke her mother,  it   is   natural   that   the   appellant,  in   a   fit   of   rage  upon seeing the deceased molesting their own daughter, would get enraged and a sudden fight would take place  during   which   the   appellant   inflicted  blows   on   the  deceased. It cannot, therefore, be said that the blows manner.   To   see   a  father molesting his own biological daughter, who is also the daughter of the appellant, would naturally be an unbearable situation for any mother. It may be true that Karishma was attached to her father, as stated by her in her deposition. However, a filial attachment to  her   father   cannot  be  construed   as   leave  and   licence  for the father to molest his own young daughter. It  has   come   in   evidence   that   the  complainant   and   his  other family members were aware of this fact which was  told   to   them   by  the   appellant   even   prior   to   this  incident.HC-NIC                               Page 65 of 80     Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017                  R/CR.A/58/2013                                          JUDGMENT70. It   is   apparent   from   the   statement   of   the  Investigating   Officer   that   Karishma   and  the   other  related   prosecution   witnesses   have   retracted   from  their   initial   statements   and  have   tried   to   suppress  the true genesis and origin of the incident. No mother can be expected to retain her senses and her cool upon  seeing her husband molesting their own  daughter. It  emerges   from   the   testimony   of   the  Investigating  Officer   that   at   the   initial  point   of   time   all   the   related   prosecution   witnesses   have   clearly   disclosed  this aspect regarding the behavior of the deceased with   his   daughter   in   their   statements.   They  have   been   confronted   with   their   previous   statements   but   have  refused to acknowledge them. The stereotyped manner in  which all of them have denied their earlier statements   suggests   tutoring,   as   all   would   not  naturally   parrot   the same kind of denials.Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/30admonished   the  deceased regarding his behaviour in molesting her even  earlier.

From   the   testimony   of   Karishma,   it   does   appear  that   she   has   been   tutored,   maybe  blame on the appellant insofar as the real cause of the incident is concerned. Being a young girl of about  sixteen   years,   one   may   understand   her  shame   and  confusion. She did not have the strength of character  to resist the tutoring  by her grandfather and other  family members, maybe because she was at the centre of  the  incident   and,   additionally,   because   after   the death of the deceased and the arrest of the appellant, 1 that she had come to  the   Court   to   give  her   testimony,  which  also   emerges  from   her  deposition.   The   improvements   in   Karishma's testimony are clearly brought out from the deposition  of   the   Investigating   Officer   wherein   he  has   stated  that Karishma has not stated before him that she told  the   appellant   not  to repeatedly   hit  her   father,  but  the   appellant   continued  to  do  so.   In   her   testimony, daughter.   She  admits   that   the   deceased   had   quarrelled   with   the  HC-NIC Page 67 of 80Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT accused   and   upon  being   admonished   by   the   appellant,  the   deceased   had   stated   "how   can   I   molest   my  own  daughter."73. The Investigating Officer is a neutral person who  has   done   his   duty.   There   can   be   no  reason   to  disbelieve his testimony. Neither has the prosecution  been   able   to   shake   him   to  74. A   careful   perusal   and   study   of   Karishma's testimony raises a doubt in the mind of the Court and points out to a strong possibility that Karishma could with whom she was residing, in order to suppress the  true   origin   and   cause   of   the   incident  in   order   to  protect   her  own   reputation  and   that  of  her   deceased father, by incriminating the accused.Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/3175. From   the   material   on   record,   the   possibility  cannot   be   ruled   out   that   upon   seeing  the   deceased  molesting   their   own   daughter,   the   appellant   got enraged and a scuffle took place between them, during  which   the   appellant   inflicted   blows   on  the   deceased  HC-NIC Page 68 of 80 Created On Mon Aug 21 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013JUDGMENT with   the   weapon   of   offence.   The   appellant,   who   had  gone   to   sleep   at  10:00   p.m.   when   the   deceased   and  Karishma were awake and watching television, would not know that the deceased would act in such reprehensible manner during the night. Nor can it be said that the  appellant   had   any  intention   to   kill  the  of   the   matter,   we   find  ourselves unable to agree with the conclusion  arrived at by the Trial Court that just because Karishma, being  a daughter, has deposed against the appellant, she must   be   believed  and  as   a corollary   to  this, the  guilt  of   the   appellant   for   committing   the   offence   of   murder  stands proved. We further find it difficult to accept  the conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court that the   appellant   has   introduced   the   story  regarding   the   molestation   of   her   daughter   Karishma   by   the   deceased  only to protect herself and divert attention from the  aspect that the deceased used to suspect her character.No mother would concoct such a story regarding her own   husband   and   young   daughter.   There  are   enough   suggestions to indicate that the deceased was molesting  8 knew about it. The Trial Court has held that  there must have been a quarrel between the accused and  the deceased as a result of which the appellant hit the   deceased   on   the   head   with   the   weapon  of   offence.However,   it   has   attributed   the   quarrel   to   the   "bad   character"   of   the   appellant.  Insofar as  the   character   of   the   appellant   is   concerned,   we   find   that   it   was  totally unnecessary and uncalled for by the Trial Court   to   have   opined   that   she   had   a   "bad  character".   The   Trial Court was not justified to put such a label upon   the   appellant.   The   Trial  Court   has,   however,   believed   that there was a sudden quarrel between the appellant  and the deceased, for whatsoever reason. We find that   there   is   a   strong   possibility   that   the  quarrel   took   place due to the incident of molestation which has been   suppressed,   but   which  emerges   in   the   form   of   contradictions,   in   order   to   raise  sufficient   doubt   in  the mind of the Court that the truth is far from what  is being projected. Though it cannot be denied that the  deceased died at the hands of the appellant, however, a   doubt   is   raised   regarding   the   manner  in   which   the   incident   took   place   and   such   doubt   is   sufficient   to  Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/3221 04:06:27 IST 2017 R/CR.A/58/2013 JUDGMENT Court   is   unable   to   agree   with   the  conclusion   of   the   Trial Court that the appellant inflicted injuries upon   the   deceased   with   the  302 of the IPC against her is proved beyond reasonable   doubt.76. In support of its conclusion that the appellant  nursed   an   intention   to   kill   the   deceased,  not   to   treat   the   deceased,   otherwise   she   would file a case against him. In any case, this witness has legal case, as he is not an  Allopathic   doctor   but   is   a   Homeopathic   doctor.   The  statement   of  the   Homeopathic   doctor  in  which  he  has  referred to the  statement  made  by  the  accused after  the   incident,   cannot   give   any   indication   of premeditation to commit the offence, which requires to  have   been   formed   much   prior   to   the  incident.

Even the smallest doubt is sufficient to take the case out of the ambit of the requirement of proving  the case against the appellant beyond all reasonable  doubt. When such a doubt is raised by the nature of the evidence on record, this Court cannot accept the  conclusion   of   the   Trial   Court   that   the  offence   of  murder,   with   all   its   ingredients,   has   been   proved against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.evidence, this Court finds that though the appellant has inflicted blows with the weapon of offence on the planned   or  predetermined manner.

The   evidence   on   record   based,   upon   the   factual  situation   emerging   therefrom,   clearly  reveals   that (i)  there was a sudden fight between the accused and  the   deceased,   the  genesis   of   which   was possibly  the  molestation   of   their   daughter   Karishma   by   the deceased, (ii) the act on the part of the appellant was not predetermined, (iii) the act was done in the Whether Reporters Of Local Papers ... vs State Of ... on 11 August, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88504574/35heat of passion and fit of rage and (iv) the appellant  has   not   taken   undue   advantage   or   acted  in   a   cruel  manner   as   it   was   the   natural   reaction   of   a   mother 86.
