Respondents(By Mr. Hanu Bhaskar, Advocate )                              ORDERJustice Permod Kohli, Chairman :This OA is directed against the order dated 21.08.2013 whereby a penalty of reduction of pay by onestage till his retirement with cumulative effect has been imposed upon the applicant. The applicanthas sought further appropriate reliefs as may be found just and proper in the facts andcircumstances of the case.OA-2167/20172. Briefly stated, the facts as emerge from the record are that the applicant who belongs to theIndian Postal Service (Group 'A') was posted as Postmaster General, Rajasthan Circle, Jaipur at thetime of filing of this OA. While he was posted as Postmaster General, Punjab Region, Chandigarh, acomplaint dated 12.11.2009 was lodged by one Smt. Ranju Prasad, then working as Director in theJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/1Punjab Region, against the applicant for alleged sexual harassment. On the basis of the saidcomplaint lodged with the respondent No.1, a note was put up by DDG (P), Department of Posts,New Delhi on 23.11.2009 seeking approval to set up an inquiry committee. It is alleged that the filewas never put up to the disciplinary authority.The note-sheet dated 23.11.2009 placed on record (Annexure A-3, page 67) indicates that acommittee comprising following officers was proposed by DDG (Personnel) and approved by theSecretary:"i. Ms. Kalpana Tiwari, Sr.DDG/CGM(MB) Chairperson ii. Shri Kamlesh Chandra, CPMG, UP CircleMember iii. Ms. Anuradha Joshi Durgapal, DDG (PAF) Member The said complaint was forwardedto the above committee. The committee sent the complaint to the applicant for his comments. Theapplicant submitted his reply dated 14.12.2009 to the committee narrating his defence.3. While the committee was seized of the aforesaid complaint, another complaint was made by oneMs. Ramandeep OA-2167/2017 Kaur to Ms. Ranju Prasad, Director, Postal Services (Annexure A-5).In the meantime, the applicant was transferred as Postmaster General (B&M), Uttarakhand Circleon 11.02.2010.4. Another complaint was made by one Ms. Sunita to the CPMG, Punjab Circle dated 27.01.2010against the applicant (Annexure A-6). The applicant submitted his reply to the complaints made byMs. Sunita and Ms. Ramandeep Kaur (Annexure A-7 and A-8) respectively. The committee constituted conducted the inquiry at Chandigarh and Delhi.Statement of Ms. Ranju Prasad was also recorded by the committee on 17.03.2010. The committeesubmitted the inquiry report dated 09.12.2010 (Annexure A-12). The committee in its report gavefollowing findings and conclusion:"(i) In Smt. Ranju Prasad's case, no sexual harassment has been established againstShri Jaswinder Singh as she failed to clearly state whether Mr. Jaswinder Singh hadeither made an oral or physical gesture towards her and he in face denied the incidentand rather stated it was Ms. Prasad who as a subordinate was indulging inmisbehavior.(ii) Though Mr. Khanna, CPMG, Punjab Circle had stated during his depositionbefore the Committee that Ms. Ranju Prasad had talked to him about Mr. JaswinderSingh's bad behaviour but again he was not able to say whether any sexual angle wasinvolved in it. It could just be a disagreement between the two officers or misbehaviorby a senior officer towards his subordinate.(iii) As far as Ms. Ramandeep Kaur is concerned, she herself has stated that no sexualharassment was OA-2167/2017 involved so her complaint regarding sexualharassment has to be discounted.Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/2(iv) As far as Ms. Sunita's evidence during her first meeting of the Inquiry Committee, then duringcross examination, she stood firm by what she has given in her written complaint. Even in herdeposition before the Committee and her replies during the cross examination were consistent andit seems that she was making a request for a official decision in her favour which she, perhaps, wasaware of that in the normal circumstances, she would not get it as the Rules did not permit it. Shewas perhaps willing to buy the decision in her favour by offering him money, and, perhaps, Mr.Jaswinder Singh sensing the window of opportunity made certain sexually laden oral overtures totest how desperate Ms. Sunita was to get her transfer and how far she would be willing to go to get it.This can only be surmised by her oral evidence and Committee's observations during the crossexamination of Ms. Sunita by Mr. Singh. Since only two people are involved where one person is outrightly denying the entire incident, it is not possible to conclusively establish that there was sexualharassment involved.87. In the final analysis, the Committee is of the view that even if allegations of sexual harassmenthave not been established beyond doubt against Mr. Jaswinder Singh, but his behaviour towardslady employees is certainly not as it should be. As CPMG during his deposition stated that he hadalso come across another case of a lady inspector being harassed by Mr. Jaswinder Singh whileseeking transfer. After hearing all the witnesses, Head of Circle and the complainants, theCommittee is of the view that Mr. Jaswinder Singh should be shifted out of Punjab Circle as hiscontinuing to function in such a senior position could lead to vitiating the working atmosphere inthe Circle but also may lead to harassment of the employees further. A watch could also be kept onhis working in future and it should also be ensured that a lady employee or officer is not directlyworking under him."OA-2167/2017 The inquiry report was placed before the disciplinary authority (the then Minister ofCommunication & I.T.). The disciplinary authority recorded following on 22.02.2011:"On going through the evidence, I am of the prima-facie opinion, that this is a case ofsexual harassment. The Committee is requested to appreciate the evidence afresh andif necessary, review its recommendations. In the meantime, the officer be shifted outof Punjab circle."On the basis of the aforesaid opinion, the DDG (P) vide his communication dated 23.02.2011addressed to the Chairperson, Complaints Committee on Sexual Harassment, suggested as under:"The Committee may therefore, go through its report, remove repetitions, as alsomake further inquiry from the stage of examining the four officials mentioned in thestatement of Ms. Sunita by giving opportunity to all concerned to clear areas ofambiguity, re-evaluate the evidence and give its findings. The Enquiry may befinalized by 15.04.2011 and the final report submitted immediately thereafter."Consequent upon the aforesaid observations of the disciplinary authority, the committee, afterfurther inquiry, submitted its revised inquiry report dated 18.05.2011 with the following findingsand recommendations:Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/3"4. After going through the depositions made by all the four officials, and the crossexaminations by Mr. Jaswinder Singh and Ms. Sunita, the Committee is of theopinion and concludes that as far as Ms. Kamlesh Sethi, Sh. Sanjeev Thakur and Sh.Sudarshan Sharma are OA-2167/2017 concerned, it does not establish anythingagainst Mr. Jaswinder Singh nor does it change or impact in any way the conclusionsdrawn by the Committee as communicated in the report submitted on 9/12/2010.""7. However, taking all the circumstances into consideration, the depositions made byMs. Sunita, Mr. Pahuja and CPMG, Punjab, the Committee is of the opinion that,perhaps something untoward happened between Ms. Sunita and Mr. JaswinderSingh when she visited him in his room to request personally for her transfer underRule 38. The fact that Ms. Sunita's deputation was cancelled immediately and alsothe compliance of orders was being monitored by the office of PMG also establishesthis fact. But to say clearly that the case is a sexual harassment, is not establishedbeyond doubt. Hence, the Committee has unanimously arrived at the sameconclusion and suggest the same action as before given in the earlier report i.e., theCommittee is of the view that Mr. Jaswinder Singh should be shifted out of PunjabCircle as his continuing to function in such a senior position could lead to vitiatingthe working atmosphere in the Circle but also may lead to harassment of theseemployees further. A watch could also be kept on his working in future and it shouldbe ensured that a lady employee or officer is not directly working under him."It is relevant to note that during the second phase of the inquiry, the committee recorded statementsof four witnesses.5. On consideration of the revised inquiry report, a note was prepared on 08.06.2011. Relevant notereads as under:"3. The Committee submitted its report on 09.12.2010 (F/A), which was submittedfor kind perusal of Hon'ble MOC&IT. As desired by Hon'ble MOC&IT, committee wasrequested to appreciate the OA-2167/2017 evidences afresh and to review itsrecommendations, if necessary. Accordingly, the committee has submitted its revisedreport on 18.05.2011. The report submitted by the committee may kindly be perusedat F/X. The final view of the Committee is reproduced below."Taking all the circumstances into consideration, the depositions made by Ms.Sunita, Mr. Pahuja and CPMG, Punjab, the Committee is of the opinion that, perhapssomething untoward happened between Ms. Sunita and Mr. Jaswinder Singh whenshe visited him in his room to request personally for her transfer under Rule 38. Thefact that Ms. Sunita's deputation was cancelled immediately and also the complianceof orders was being monitored by the office of PMG also establishes this fact. But tosay clearly that the case is a sexual harassment, is not established beyond doubt.Hence, the Committee has unanimously arrived at the same conclusion and suggestthe same action as before given in the earlier report i.e., the Committee is of the viewJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/4that Mr. Jaswinder Singh should be shifted out of Punjab Circle as his continuing tofunction in such a senior position could lead to vitiating the working atmosphere inthe Circle but also may lead to harassment of these employees further. A watch couldalso be kept on his working in future and it should be ensured that a lady employee orofficer is not directly working under him."4. It is submitted that the officer has already been transferred from Punjab Circle to MaharashtraCircle and posted as PMG (BD & Mktg), Mumbai. In above connection, kind attention is invited toRule 15 of CCS (CCA) Rules 1965 regarding action in inquiry report. According to Rule 15 of CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965, the report has to be submitted to the Hon'ble MOC&IT, who is the CompetentAuthority for acceptance. If approved, case may be submitted to Hon'ble MOC&IT for accepting thefindings of the Inquiry Committee."OA-2167/2017 The Secretary (Posts), on consideration of the aforesaid note, made followingrecommendation:"We may accept the recommendations of the Committee. The officer is alreadyposted out of Punjab."The disciplinary authority, however, mentioned:"Opinion of ASG, Indira Jaisingh, may be taken first"In view of the above directions, opinion of Ms. Indira Jaisingh, the then ASG of India, was obtained.Copy of the said opinion is placed on record at pages 89 to 99. The ASG, after discussing theevidence brought on record during the inquiry, vide her opinion dated 09.03.2012 made followingsuggestions:"37. A reading of the above provision indicates that the Disciplinary Authority maydiffer from the inquiry report. However, in such a situation reasons for differing fromthe opinion of the Inquiry report needs to be stated.", and formulated her opinionwhich is as follows:"40. In view of the above, I come to the conclusion that the findings of the inquirycommittee are perverse in as much as the case of misconduct of having committedsexual harassment against Ms. Ranju Prasad and Ms. Sunita stand proved on theevidence on record. The case of Ms. Ramandeep Kaur is not being considered as shedid not subject herself to cross-examination. And in view of the above, DisciplinaryAuthority is at liberty to differ with the Inquiry Committee report. Having regard tothe law, a finding to that effect and tentative reasons for differing OA-2167/2017 fromthe opinion of the Inquiry Committee may be recorded. Also, an opportunity shouldbe given to the charge-sheeted employee to represent against the finding of theDisciplinary Authority. Also, Mr. Singh should be provided with the copy of theinquiry report, the tentative findings of the disciplinary authority disagreeing withJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/5the findings of the inquiry report at the earliest.Opinion accordingly.Sd/-INDIRA JAISINGH (Addl. Solicitor General of India)"Final report of the complaints committee dated 18.05.2011 along with the opinion ofthe ASG was placed before the disciplinary authority, who recorded its note ofdisagreement dated 18.04.2012 (pages 102-106). This disagreement note was served upon the applicant vide memorandum dated 30.04.2012(Annexure A-22) for his comments/representation within a period of thirty days. The applicantsubmitted his representation against the disagreement note and the inquiry report on 29.06.2012(Annexure A-23) refuting all the allegations against him. The aforesaid representation was followedby a supplementary representation dated 02.08.2012 (Annexure A-24). The disciplinary authority, after receipt of the representation of the applicant, sought advice ofthe Union Public Service Commission.The Commission under its advice vide communication dated 03.05.2013 made the followingrecommendations:"4. In the light of the observations and findings as discussed above and after takinginto account all OA-2167/2017 facts and circumstances relevant to the case, theCommission consider that the charges are proved against the CO and the ends ofjustice would be met if the penalty of Reduction of pay by one stage till his retirementwith cumulative effect is imposed on the CO Shri Jaswinder Singh. They adviseaccordingly."On receipt of the advice of UPSC, the disciplinary authority passed the impugned order dated21.08.2013 imposing the penalty of reduction of pay by one stage till retirement with cumulativeeffect upon the applicant.6. The respondents filed reply to the OA reiterating the allegations made in the complaints againstthe applicant. The respondents further referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court incase of Visakha & others v. State of Rajasthan & others [(1997) 6 SCC 241], and Governmentinstructions issued vide office memorandum dated 13.02.1998. It is further stated that in terms ofVisakha's judgment and the Government instructions, no separate charge-sheet is required to beserved upon the charged officer, and the complaint of sexual harassment against the charged officeris to be treated as the charge-sheet. The report of the complaints committee is to be deemed as theinquiry report under the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. No separate inquiry officer is required to beappointed nor any presenting officer is to be appointed. Hence, the charged officer is also not to beJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/6provided with the defence assistant.It is further stated that the disciplinary authority disagreed with the OA-2167/2017 report andfindings of the complaints committee and served the disagreement note upon the applicant, and onconsideration of his representation the impugned penalty order has been passed.7. The applicant submitted rejoinder to the reply filed by the respondents and reiterated theaverments made in the OA. He also placed on record copy of the order dated 24.11.2009 constitutingthe complaints committee and the terms of reference, along with some clarifications on variousquestions in cases of sexual harassment of women at workplace, as also copies of the complaintsmade against the charged officer, etc.8. The respondents thereafter filed reply to the rejoinder placing on record certain notings.9. Mr. A. K. Behera, learned counsel appearing for the applicant, has sought quashing of theimpugned penalty order on the following grounds:(1) That the complaints committee has not been constituted by the disciplinaryauthority, but only by the Secretary of the Department. Such constitution is illegal,and consequently all disciplinary proceedings are liable to be quashed.OA-2167/2017 (2) That the copy of advice of UPSC obtained by the disciplinary authority and reliedupon in the impugned penalty order was not served upon the applicant prior to passing of impugnedorder. The applicant was not provided any opportunity to respond to UPSC's advice relied upon inimpugned penalty order, violating principles of natural justice.(3) That the disciplinary authority had no competence to seek the opinion of the ASG of India andwas required to apply its own independent mind. In any case, the opinion of the ASG was notfurnished to the applicant to enable him to explain and respond to the same.(4) The disciplinary authority in its disagreement note has based its order only on the opinion of theASG and was thus influenced by the said opinion, without providing any opportunity to theapplicant to respond to the ASG's opinion, thus there is violation of the principles of natural justice.(5) That the disciplinary authority while remitting the case back to the complaints committee(inquiry committee) asked it to re-appreciate the evidence, which is impermissible in law.OA-2167/2017 (6) That in the disagreement note, the disciplinary authority had formulated its finalopinion and not the tentative opinion. As a matter of fact, the disciplinary authority had made up itsmind to impose penalty on the applicant.The disagreement note is not in accordance with law.10. Heard learned counsel for the parties.Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/711. Ground 1-The plea of the charged officer (applicant) is that the complaints committee to inquireinto the charges of sexual harassment was required to be constituted by the Disciplinary Authority.It is argued by Mr. Behera that as a matter of fact on the complaint of sexual harassment against theapplicant, the Disciplinary Authority was to initiate the disciplinary proceedings and for purposes ofallegations of sexual harassment, the Disciplinary Authority alone was to constitute the complaintscommittee. In the present case, the committee was proposed by the DDG (Personnel) vide Notedated November 23rd, 2009 and the said Note was approved by the Secretary alone and not by theDisciplinary Authority (Hon'ble Minister for Communication & IT). Reference is made to notings atpage 67 of the OA. The note has been reproduced hereinabove. From the notings on the file, it isevident that the constitution of the complaints committee was never placed before the DisciplinaryAuthority. Apart from that, in reply to rejoinder filed by OA-2167/2017 the applicant, therespondents have produced the note-sheet whereby the representation of the applicant dated29.06.2012 against the inquiry report and disagreement note was dealt with. The relevant extractsare as under:-"3. The representation dated 29.06.2012 submitted by Shri Jaswinder Singh maykindly be perused at FR. After going through his representation, it is seen that thecharged officer has objection on mainly following points. The submission made bythe Charged Officer and comments thereon are submitted below.(A) Complaint Committee was constituted by the Secretary, Department of Posts,who was not authorized to do so.Comment: In the case of Vishaka and Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan and Ors. (JT 1997(7) SC 384), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the guidelines andnorms to be observed to prevent sexual harassment of working women at their workplace. Accordingly, Department of Personnel & Training, the nodal Department inthe matter, has issued basic guidelines/instructions vide their OMNo.11013/10/97-Estt (A) dated 13th February 1998 (F/A). As per para 6 of the OM,an appropriate complaint mechanism should be created in every organization forredressal of the complaint made by victim. Wherever such mechanism for redressalof grievance already exist, they may be made more effective and in particular womenofficers should preferably handle such complaints. It is no where mentioned that whowill be competent to constitute such Committee. Therefore, Secretary (Posts), who isthe Head of the Department, is fully competent to constitute Inquiry Committee toprevent sexual harassment of working women at work place. The extant instructionsin the matter do not provide that only the Disciplinary Authority is competent toconstitute such committee to inquire into the complaints of sexual harassment ofworking women at their work place. Moreover, when the Committee OA-2167/2017submitted its report on 09.12.2010, it was perused by the Disciplinary Authority, i.e.,Hon'ble MOC&IT.From the above, it is established that the committee was constituted by the Secretary alone withoutany approval of the Disciplinary Authority. The respondents have taken a stand that it is notJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/8necessary that the complaints committee to inquire into the charges of sexual harassment wasrequired to be constituted by the Disciplinary Authority.12. Rule 14 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 deal with the procedure for imposing penalties. Sub-rule (2) ofRule 14 reads as under:-"(2) Whenever the Disciplinary Authority is of the opinion that there are grounds forinquiring into the truth of any imputation of misconduct or misbehaviour against aGovernment servant, it may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule or underthe provisions of the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850, as the case may be, anauthority to inquire into the truth thereof:"Provided that where there is a complaint of sexual harassment within the meaningof Rule 3-C of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, the ComplaintsCommittee established in each Ministry or Department or Office for inquiring intosuch complaints, shall be deemed to be the Inquiring Authority appointed by theDisciplinary Authority for the purpose of these rules and the Complaints Committeeshall hold, if separate procedure has not been prescribed for the ComplaintsCommittee for holding the inquiry into the complaints of sexual harassment, theinquiry as far as practicable in accordance with the procedure laid down in theserules."OA-2167/2017 Sub-rule (2) mandates that whenever the Disciplinary Authority is ofthe opinion that there are grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation ormisconduct against a government servant, it may itself inquire into, or appoint theinquiring authority. Proviso to it which was introduced by way of an amendment inthe rule vide Notification dated 01.07.2004 and published in the gazette dated10.07.2004 required that in case of complaint of sexual harassment, the ComplaintsCommittee established in each Ministry or Department or Office for inquiring intosuch complaints shall be deemed to be the Inquiring Authority appointed by theDisciplinary Authority. In the present case, no permanent complaints committee wasestablished in the Ministry or in the Department to inquire into the imputations ofsexual harassment. It was only on the complaints of Ms. Ranju Prasad, a womenemployee, that the inquiring committee was constituted by the Ministry under theorders of Secretary. The constitution of complaints committee had no approval of theDisciplinary Authority. As a matter of fact, the constitution of inquiring committeeitself is an initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the charged officer. Sub-rule(2) of Rule 14 clearly requires the opinion of the Disciplinary Authority to initiatedisciplinary proceedings. However, at the time of initiation of disciplinaryproceedings, the matter was never placed before the Disciplinary OA-2167/2017Authority. Apart from that, Rule 13 prescribes the authority to institute proceedings.Rule 13 is reproduced hereunder:-Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/9"13. Authority to institute proceedings (1) The President or any other authorityempowered by him by general or special order may-(a) institute disciplinary proceedings against any Government servant;(b) direct a Disciplinary Authority to institute disciplinary proceedings against anyGovernment servant on whom that Disciplinary Authority is competent to imposeunder these rules any of the penalties specified in Rule 11.(2) A Disciplinary Authority competent under these rules to impose any of thepenalties specified in Clauses (i) to (iv) of Rule 11 may institute disciplinaryproceedings against any Government servant for the imposition of any of thepenalties specified in Clauses(v) to (ix) of Rule 11 notwithstanding that such Disciplinary Authority is notcompetent under these rules to impose any of the latter penalties."Sub-rule (1) of Rule 13 empowers the President or any authority empowered by himby general or special orders to institute disciplinary proceedings against anygovernment servant, and by such order, the disciplinary authority maybe directed toinstitute disciplinary proceedings against the Government servant on whom thatdisciplinary authority is competent to impose penalties specified under Rule 11. It isadmitted case of the parties that in the present case the President is the DisciplinaryAuthority and the Hon'ble Minister of the concerned department is a Delegatee of thePresident OA-2167/2017 to institute disciplinary proceedings under Rule 13. TheSecretary of the department was never empowered and in any case no such general orspecial order has been placed on record to demonstrate that the Secretary of thedepartment was competent to initiate disciplinary proceedings and appoint theinquiring authority to inquire into the charges against the applicant.13. In Vishaka & Others v State of Rajasthan & Others (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court havingbeen apprised of the allegations of sexual harassment of women at work places, took cognizance ofthe public interest litigation and issued guidelines.After defining the duty of the employer or other responsible person in work place etc. and layingdown the broader definition of sexual harassment, the Apex Court also prescribed the nature ofproceedings to be initiated. In para 4 of the guidelines, criminal proceedings were suggested wherethe conduct amounts to specific offence under the Indian Penal Code or any other law, and in othercases disciplinary action. The relevant guidelines are reproduced hereunder:"5. Disciplinary action:Where such conduct amounts to misconduct in employment as defined by therelevant service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated by theJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/10employer in accordance with those rules.6. Complaint mechanism:OA-2167/2017 Whether or not such conduct constitutes an offence under law or abreach of the service rules, an appropriate complaint mechanism should be created inthe employer's organization for redress of the complaint made by the victim. Suchcomplaint mechanism should ensure time-bound treatment of complaints.7. Complaints Committee:The complaint mechanism, referred to in (6) above, should be adequate to provide, where necessary,a Complaints Committee, a special counsellor or other support service, including the maintenance ofconfidentiality.The Complaints Committee should be headed by a woman and not less than half of its membersshould be women. Further, to prevent the possibility of any undue pressure or influence from seniorlevels, such Complaints Committee should involve a third party, either NGO or other body who isfamiliar with the issue of sexual harassment.The Complaints Committee must make an annual report to the Government Department concernedof the complaints and action taken by them.The employers and person-in-charge will also report on the compliance with the aforesaidguidelines including on the reports of the Complaints Committee to the Government Department.8. Workers' initiative:Employees should be allowed to raise issues of sexual harassment at workers' meeting and in otherappropriate forum and it should be affirmatively discussed in employer-employee meetings.9. Awareness:Awareness of the rights of female employees in this regard should be created in particular byprominently notifying the guidelines (and appropriate legislation when enacted on the subject) in asuitable manner.10. Third-party harassment:OA-2167/2017 Where sexual harassment occurs as a result of an act or omission byany third party or outsider, the employer and person-in-charge will take all stepsnecessary and reasonable to assist the affected person in terms of support andpreventive action.Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/1111. The Central/State Governments are requested to consider adopting suitablemeasures including legislation to ensure that the guidelines laid down by this orderare also observed by the employers in private sector."After the above guidelines were laid down, some women organizations again approached theHon'ble Supreme Court alleging non-compliance of the guidelines, whereupon the Apex Courtpassed the following order in Medha Kotwal Lele & others v Union of India & others [(2013) 1 SCC311]:"Several petitions had been filed before this Court by women organisations and onthe basis of the note prepared by the Registrar General that in respect of sexualharassment cases the Complaints Committees were not formed in accordance withthe guidelines issued by this Court in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC241] and that these petitions fell under clause (6) of the PIL Guidelines given by thisCourt i.e. "Atrocities on Women" and in any event the Guidelines set out in Vishakawere not being followed. Thereupon, this Court treated the petitions as writ petitionsfiled in public interest.2. Notice had been issued to several parties including the Governments concernedand on getting appropriate responses from them and now after hearing the learnedAttorney General for UOI and the learned counsel, we direct as follows:"Complaints Committee as envisaged by the Supreme Court in its judgment inVishaka case (1997) 6 SCC 241 at p. 253, will be deemed to be an inquiry authority forthe OA-2167/2017 purposes of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964(hereinafter called the CCS Rules) and the report of the Complaints Committee shallbe deemed to be an inquiry report under the CCS Rules. Thereafter the disciplinaryauthority will act on the report in accordance with the Rules."14. Visaakha's judgment (supra), which later came to be modified/clarified by MedhaKotwal Lele & others v Union of India & others (supra), does not, in any manner,direct non-compliance of the provisions of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. The onlydirection was that the complaints committee will be deemed to be an inquiringauthority under the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. However, the manner and mode ofconstitution of the committee and the authority who is to constitute and initiate thedisciplinary proceedings has not been laid down in Visakha's judgment (supra), thusthe mandate of rule 14(2) of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 would remain in operation.Further, rule 13 which prescribes the authority to initiate disciplinary proceedingshas not been complied with.15.

Gopinath & others [(2014) 1 SCC 351] has laid down following four stages under which thedisciplinary authority has to take action:-OA-2167/2017 "i) initiation of Disciplinary proceedings for major penalties;ii) drawing up of charges of misconduct;iii) appointment of Inquiry Officer & Presenting Officer and to supervise fairconducting of inquiry by the Inquiry Officer;iv) imposition of penalty, if any."It is thus established that initiation of disciplinary proceedings and constitution of the inquiringcommittee is the sole domain of the disciplinary authority. In the present case, neither initiation ofthe disciplinary proceedings nor constitution of the inquiry committee was by disciplinary authority,and thus initiation of the disciplinary proceedings, including constitution of the inquiry committee,was by incompetent authority. This also renders all subsequent proceedings as illegal.16. Ground (2) - The applicant has taken the plea of non furnishing of UPSC's advice before passingof the impugned order in the grounds of the OA which reads as under:-"(L) Because as per extant instructions and judgments of various UPSC's advice wasexpected to be provided to be applicant prior to issue of the impugned order.However, in the instant case the same has not been done."In reply to the aforesaid ground, the respondents have stated as under:-OA-2167/2017 "5.12 That the contents of para 5 (L) of the Original Application arewrong hence denied. There is no provision in the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 that thecopy of the UPSC's advice would be provided to the charged officer before passingfinal order in the disciplinary matters. However, copy of the UPSC's advice was dulysupplied to the applicant along with the punishment order."Apart from the above admission, this fact is also established from the impugned order itself. Paras 6& 7 of the impugned order are reproduced hereunder:-"6. After careful consideration of the Report of the Inquiry Committee, therepresentation dated 29.06.2012 of the charged officer thereon and all evidences onrecord, the President, the disciplinary authority has come to a conclusion that thecharged officer could not convincingly and logically refute the charges and was notable to substantiate his arguments in his representation. It was tentatively decided bythe President that the charges that stood proved were grave enough warrantingimposition of a suitable penalty and the case was referred to the UPSC for its adviceon the quantum of punishment or otherwise to be imposed on the charged officer.Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/137. The UPSC has tendered their advice vide their letter No.F/3/374/2012-SI dated03.05.2013, a copy of which is enclosed. The UPSC has observed in their advice thatShri Jaswinder Singh appeared to be a habitual offender and had attempted toblackmail ladies subordinate to him in the organization for dispensing sexual favourstowards him. They observed that the misconduct of committing sexual harassmentagainst Ms. Ranju Prasad and Ms. Sunita stood proved based on the evidence onrecord. In the light of these observations and findings and after taking into accountall facts and circumstances relevant to the case, the UPSC consider that the ends ofjustice would be met if the penalty of "Reduction of OA-2167/2017 pay by one stagetill his retirement with cumulative effect" is imposed on the CO Shri JaswinderSingh."In para 6 above, the Disciplinary Authority referred to representation dated 29.06.2012 of thecharged officer and thereafter mentioned about the reference of the case to UPSC for its advice onthe quantum of punishment or otherwise. In para 7, reference is made to UPSC's advice dated03.05.2013, copy whereof was enclosed with the impugned penalty order. Thus, it is established thatafter the representation of the applicant was obtained in respect to the Inquiry Report and thedisagreement note, the matter was referred to the UPSC whose advice was received by theDisciplinary Authority on 03.05.2013 and relied upon for imposing the penalty. The copy of theUPSC's report was furnished to the charged officer with the impugned penalty order. The Hon'bleSupreme Court in Union of India vs. S. K. Kapoor [(2011) 4 SCC 589] has held as under:-"8. There may be a case where the report of the Union Public Service Commission isnot relied upon by the disciplinary authority and in that case it is certainly notnecessary to supply a copy of the same to the concerned employee. However, if it isrelied upon, then a copy of the same must be supplied in advance to the concernedemployee, otherwise, there will be violation of the principles of natural justice. This isalso the view taken by this Court in the case of S.N. Narula vs. Union of India &Others, Civil Appeal No.642 of 2004 decided on 30th January, 2004 (emphasissupplied)."OA-2167/2017 Non-furnishing of UPSC's advice is a serious omission as it violatesthe principles of natural justice and deprives the charged officer of his right torespond to UPSC's advice. Non-furnishing of UPSC's advice before passing thepenalty order rendered the penalty order illegal.17. Grounds 3 & 4 - As noticed hereinabove, the first report of the inquiry committee dated09.12.2010 and revised report dated 18.05.2011 were placed before the disciplinary authority whodirected to obtain opinion of ASG, Indira Jaising, as per the noting dated 08.07.2011 (pages 86 & 87of the OA). The same reads as under:-"3. The Committee submitted its report on 09.12.2010 (F/A), which was submittedfor kind perusal of Hon'ble MOC&IT. As desired by Hon'ble MOC&IT, committee wasrequested to appreciate the evidences afresh and to review its recommendations, ifJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/14necessary. Accordingly, the committee has submitted its revised report on18.05.2011. The report submitted by the committee may kindly be perused at F/X.The final view of the Committee is reproduced below."Taking all the circumstances into consideration, the depositions made by Ms.Sunita, Mr. Pahuja and CPMG, Punjab the Committee is of the opinion that, perhaps,something untoward happened between Ms. Sunita and Mr. Jaswinder Singh whenshe visited him in his room to request personally for her transfer under Rule 38. Thefact that Ms. Sunita's deputation was cancelled immediately and also the complianceof orders was being monitored by the office of PMG also establishes this fact. But tosay clearly that the case is a sexual harassment, if not established beyond doubt.Hence the OA-2167/2017 Committee has unanimously arrived at the same conclusionand suggests the same action as before given in the earlier report, i.e., the Committeeis of the view that Mr. Jaswinder Singh should be shifted out of Punjab Circle as hiscontinuing to function in such a senior position could lead to vitiating the workingatmosphere in the Circle but also may lead to harassment of these employees further.A watch could also be kept on his working in future and it should also be ensured thata lady employee or officer is not directly working under him.4. It is submitted that the officer has already been transferred from Punjab Circle toMaharashtra Circle and posted as PMG (BD & Mktg), Mumbai. In above connection,kind attention is invited to Rule 15 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 regarding action oninquiry report.According to Rule 15 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, the report has to be submitted to the Hon'bleMOC&IT, who is the Competent Authority for acceptance. If approved, case may be submitted toHon'ble MOC&OT for accepting the findings of the Inquiry Committee.Submitted pls.Abhay08.VI.XI SO (SPG) ADG (SGP) Dir (Staff) DDG (P) Member (P): Vacant Secretary (Pers) : We mayaccept the recommendations of the committee. The officer is already posted out of Punjab.MOC&IT- fist take opinion of ASG, Indira Jaising.OA-2167/2017 This is regarding complaint made by officers of Punjab Circle regarding sexualharassment at work place against Shri Jaswinder Singh(IPoS-1980), PMG. Notes on page 15/Ntowards will recall the case.2. The final report dated 18.05.2011 of the Complaint Committee was submitted to the Hon'bleMOC&IT for its acceptance. Hon'ble MOC&IT has ordered the following:Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/15"opinion of ASG, Indira Jaising, may be taken first"3. In view of above order of Hon'ble MOC&IT, we may refer the case to Ministry of Law with arequest to seek the opinion of Learned ASG Ms. Indira Jaising in the matter.Submitted plz."18. The procedure to be adopted for action on the inquiry report has been prescribed under Rule 15of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965.Sub-rule (2) of Rule 15 deals with such a procedure. The same reads as under:-"(2) The Disciplinary Authority shall forward or cause to be forwarded a copy of thereport of the inquiry, if any, held by the Disciplinary Authority or where theDisciplinary Authority is not the Inquiring Authority, a copy of the report of theInquiring Authority together with its own tentative reasons for disagreement, if any,with the findings of Inquiring Authority or any article of charge to the Governmentservant who shall be required to submit, if he so desires, his written representation orsubmission to the Disciplinary Authority within fifteen days, irrespective of whetherthe report is favourable or not to the Government servant."The above rule does not envisage opinion of a third person on the inquiry report and that too from alaw officer to be nominated by the OA-2167/2017 disciplinary authority by name. We may observethat in the present case, the then disciplinary authority was himself a known jurist.Under what circumstances the course in contravention to Rule 15 (2), referring the case to ASG, wasadopted is not evident from the record. The disciplinary authority who is not merely a law knowingperson but himself a jurist was to consider the issue, but the said authority chose to refer it to thenominated law officer for the reasons best known to him. Firstly, such a procedure is alien to theservice jurisprudence and not envisaged under Rule 15 of CCS (CCA) Rules,965.19. Assuming seeking opinion of a Law Officer is not forbidden under the rules and the disciplinaryauthority in its wisdom chose to seek such an opinion, it being an extraneous material, it wasincumbent upon the disciplinary authority to have furnished a copy of the opinion of the ASG to thecharged officer for his response in observance of the principles of natural justice. The same principleas applies to the advice of the UPSC is also applicable where the disciplinary authority decides toseek any advice or opinion of a third person not associated with the disciplinary proceedings. Thedisciplinary authority has heavily relied upon opinion of the ASG while passing the disagreementnote. Non-furnishing of ASG's opinion to the charged officer and without OA-2167/2017 providing him anopportunity to make representation itself violates the principles of natural justice and the ratio ofJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/16the judgment in S. K.Kapoor's case (supra) would be equally attracted in the present case on this count as well and theimpugned order is thus vitiated for non furnishing of ASG's report to the charged officer.20. Ground 5 - From the noting on file, we find that when the Disciplinary Authority considered theinquiry report dated 09.12.2010, it recorded as under:-"On going through the evidence, I am of the prima- facie opinion, that this is a case ofsexual harassment. The Committee is requested to appreciate the evidence afresh andif necessary, review its recommendations. In the meantime, the officer be shifted outof Punjab circle.(KAPIL SIBAL) MoC&IT"Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 deals with action on the Inquiry Report. It reads as under:-"(1) The Disciplinary Authority, if it is not itself the Inquiring Authority may, forreasons to be recorded by it in writing, remit the case to the Inquiring Authority forfurther inquiry and report and the Inquiring Authority shall thereupon proceed tohold the further inquiry according to the provisions of Rule 14, as far as may be."On consideration of the Inquiry Report, the Disciplinary Authority is entitled to remit the case to theinquiring authority for further inquiry and report by recording reasons. In the present case, theDisciplinary OA-2167/2017 Authority has chosen to remit the case firstly without recording anyreasons and secondly it emphasized that the inquiring authority may appreciate the evidence afreshand, if necessary, review its recommendations. This clearly was intended to issue directions to theinquiring authority to re-appreciate the evidence and revise its recommendations. It would not beinappropriate if this direction is considered to be an attempt to influence the inquiring authority forreconsideration of its opinion on the evidence and recommendations.Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 empowers the Disciplinary Authority to remit the case for further inquiry butnot to issue directions to re-appreciate the evidence afresh and to revise the recommendations. Suchrecourse is also contrary to the mandate of Rule 15 (1). The action of the Disciplinary Authority isalso contrary to law.21. Ground 6 - It is vehemently argued on behalf of the applicant that in the disagreement notedated 18.04.2012, the Disciplinary Authority has formulated final opinion, demonstratingpre-determined mind. The Disciplinary Authority has recorded as under:-"15. Hence, for the reasons stated above, I differ from the opinion of the InquiryCommittee and have come to the conclusion that the findings of the InquiryCommittee are perverse in as much as the case of misconduct of having committedsexual harassment against Ms. Ranju Prasad and Ms. Sunita sand proved on theJaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/17evidence on record. The Committee has failed to take note of the position ofdominance of Mr. Singh OA-2167/2017 over these women and the vulnerability ofthese women at workplace. The case of Ms. Ramandeep Kaur is not being considered,as she did not subject herself to cross-examination. The Committee has failed to notethat the repeated complaint by women of sexual harassment have created a hostileworking environment.Referring to the above opinion of the Disciplinary Authority in the disagreement note, it isstrenuously argued by Mr. Behera that the Disciplinary Authority has held the charged officer guiltyof misconduct while disagreeing with the report of the inquiring authority. It demonstratespre-determined mind of the Disciplinary Authority. This issue is no more res integra having beenconsidered by the Apex Court in Ram Kishan v Union of India & others [(1995) 6 SCC 157], whereinthe following observations were made:"...The purpose of the show cause notice, in case of disagreement with the findings ofthe enquiry officer, is to enable the delinquent to show that the disciplinary authorityis persuaded not to disagree with the conclusions reached by the inquiry officer forthe reasons given in the inquiry report or he may offer additional reasons in supportof the finding by the inquiry officer. In that situation, unless the disciplinaryauthority gives specific reasons in the show cause on the basis of which the findingsof the inquiry officer in that behalf is based, it would be difficult for the delinquent tosatisfactorily give reasons to persuade the disciplinary authority to agree with theconclusions reached by the inquiry officer. In the absence of any ground or reason inthe show cause notice it amounts to an empty formality which would cause graveprejudice to the delinquent officer and would result in injustice to him. The mere factthat in the final order some reasons have been given to OA-2167/2017 disagree withthe conclusions reached by the disciplinary authority cannot cure the defect...."The Hon'ble Supreme Court, considering Ram Kishan's case (supra) and some other judgments, in alater decision reported as Punjab National Bank & others v Kunj Behari Misra [(1998) 7 SCC 84]held as under:"The result of the aforesaid discussion would be that the principles of natural justicehave to be read into Regulation 7 (2). As a result thereof whenever the disciplinaryauthority disagrees with the inquiry authority on any article of charge then before itrecords its own findings on such charge, it must record its tentative reasons for suchdisagreement and give to the delinquent officer an opportunity to represent before itrecords its findings. The report of the inquiry officer containing its findings will haveto be conveyed and the delinquent officer will have an opportunity to persuade thedisciplinary authority to accept the favourable conclusion of the inquiry officer. Theprinciples of natural justice, as we have already observed, require the authority,which has to take a final decision and can impose a penalty, to give an opportunity tothe officer charged of misconduct to file representation before the disciplinaryauthority records its findings on the charges framed against the officer."Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/1822. Shri Behera has further referred to the disagreement note and the opinion of the ASG to say thatthe disagreement note is nothing but adoption of the opinion of ASG. He has compared the paras ofthe disagreement note with the opinion of the ASG. The relevant paragraphs are reproducedhereunder:-OA-2167/2017 Sl. Disagreement Note ASG's Opinion No.1.

In the circumstances, the finding Personal of DA of the inquiry committee is perverse andrequires to be rejected. Further the finding is also perverse, as he inquiry committee seems to beusing a "standard of proof beyond doubt". This is incorrect as the committee is to judge on the"balance of probabilities" and not on "proof beyond doubt" as this is "civil matter and not a criminalmatter".Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/23OA-2167/20179.

On the facts established by the         No equivalence      Inquiry Committee, I am entitled      to differ with the findings if they      are perverse or if irrelevant facts      are taken into consideration. I      have already pointed out that the      findings were perverse.        That      apart, the Inquiry Committee has      not taken into consideration the      relevant fact that the charged      officer was in a position of      authority over each of the three      women who have complained      against him and was in a position      to influence and affect their terms      and condition of appointment      including transfer and deputation.      He was exercising supervisory      and disciplinary control over      them.15.   Hence, for the reasons stated           In view of the above, I come to      above, I differ from the opinion of     the conclusion that the findings      the Inquiry Committee and have          of the inquiry committee are      come to the conclusion that the         perverse in as much as the case      findings of the Inquiry Committee       of misconduct of having                                                                         OA-2167/2017      are perverse in as much as the          committed sexual harassment      case of misconduct of having            against Ms. Ranju Prasad and      committed sexual harassment             Ms.Sunita stand proved on the      against Ms.Ranju Prasad and Ms.         evidence on record.

In my opinion, there is no need to      No equivalence      remit the matter for further      inquiry and I am at liberty under      rule 15 (2) of CCS (CCA) Rules      1965 to differ with the conclusion      of the Inquiry Committee on      conclusive facts.17.   Since I have differed with the          A reading of the above judicial      findings     of     the      Inquiry    pronouncements indicates that      Committee, I hereby grant a             it is within the prerogative of      period of 30 days from the date of      the Disciplinary Authority to      issuance of this decision to the        differ from the report of      delinquent       to     make        a   inquiry officer. However, in      representation      against      the    doing so the Disciplinary      findings    and     my      decision    Authority must record its      recorded herein.        Mr. Singh       reason for differing with the      should be provided with the copy        report of Inquiry Officer. Also,of the inquiry report at the earliest an opportunity should be to enable him to make his provided todelinquent officer representation against the to represent before the findings. Disciplinary Authoritybefore it records its findings.OA-2167/2017 The above factual position as is revealed from the opinion of the ASG and that of theDisciplinary Authority in the disagreement note clearly established that the Disciplinary Authorityhas completely adopted the opinion of the ASG without application of its own mind and imposed theimpugned penalty order. This is a clear case of violation of principles of natural justice as the reportof the ASG was never furnished to the charged officer for his opinion.23. From the perusal of the impugned order, it is evident that the Disciplinary Authority has notrecorded reasons for imposing the penalty. The charged officer in his representation dealt with notonly the allegations but all questions in-extenso. The Disciplinary Authority has recorded thefollowing observations in the impugned order:-Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/27"5. The President carefully considered the Inquiry Report dated 18.05.2011 submittedby the Complaints Committee and tentatively decided to disagree with the findings ofthe report. Thereafter, a copy of the Inquiry Report along with the disagreement notewas forwarded to the charged officer vide Memo No.15- 7/2009-SPGdated30.04.2012 and subsequent memo dated 04.05.2012 to enable him to make writtenrepresentation and submission against the Inquiry Report of the Committee and thetentative decision of the President disagreeing with the findings of the InquiryCommittee. Due process was adopted in the process as required under the rules. Thecharged officer was informed to submit a written reply on the findings of theComplaints Committee and tentative decision of the President within a period of 30days irrespective of the fact whether the Report was favourable to him or not. Thecharged officer OA-2167/2017 submitted his final representation dated 29.06.2012on the inquiry report and the tentative view of the President.6. After careful consideration of the Report of the Inquiry Committee, therepresentation dated 29.06.2012 of the charged officer thereon and all evidences onrecord, the President, the disciplinary authority has come to a conclusion that thecharged officer could not convincingly and logically refute the charges and was notable to substantiate his arguments in his representation. It was tentatively decided bythe President that the charges that stood proved were grave enough warrantingimposition of a suitable penalty and the case was referred to the UPSC for its adviceon the quantum of punishment or otherwise to be imposed on the charged officer.From the above, it appears that the Disciplinary Authority has not recorded any reasons, nor dealtwith the representation with the contentions of charged officer raised in its two representations andimposed the penalty. The impugned penalty order is liable to be set aside on this count as well.24. Under normal circumstances, for non compliance of the principles of natural justice andnon-recording of reasons, we would have remitted the case back to the disciplinary authority.However, we are of the considered view that the present case is not such where the matter should beremitted back to the disciplinary authority for re-examination/re-consideration. The proceedingswere initiated against the applicant in the year 2009 and have continued up to 2013 when thepenalty order was passed. The applicant has already retired from service. It is more than eight yearsthat the sword of OA-2167/2017 disciplinary proceedings remained hanging over the head of theapplicant. The applicant has suffered a lot. Otherwise also, the inquiry committee on two occasionsexonerated the applicant, but the disciplinary authority did not agree with the opinion of the inquirycommittee and imposed the penalty. We have already discussed the manner in which thedisciplinary authority has dealt with the matter.This is a fit case where the matter must be given a quietus at this stage. Our opinion is fortified bythe judgment of the Apex Court reported as Narinder Mohan Arya v United India Insurance Co.[2006 SCC (L&S) 840] wherein, under similar circumstances, the Hon'ble Supreme Court declinedto remit the case to the disciplinary authority.Jaswinder Singh vs M/O Communications on 1 March, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5914801/2825. In the totality of factual and legal analysis, the impugned penalty order is liable to be set aside.This OA is accordingly allowed. The impugned penalty order is hereby set aside. The applicant hasretired during the pendency of this OA on 30.09.2017.He shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.( K. N.
