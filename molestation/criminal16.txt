RespondentThrough: Mr. Augustine Chatterjee, Advocate CORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI VIPIN SANGHI, J. (OPEN COURT)1. The present appeal has been preferred to assail the judgment dated 31.01.2009 passed in HMA214/07 by Additional District Judge (ADJ), Delhi, whereby the learned ADJ has passed a decree ofjudicial separation in favour of the respondent-husband and against the appellant-wife.2. The respondent-husband had preferred a petition under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu MarriageAct to seek dissolution of his marriage with the appellant-wife on the ground of cruelty. Instead ofgranting the divorce and dissolving the marriage, learned ADJ had moulded the relief and grantedthe decree of judicial separation. The parties were married in the year 1972. Out of the wedlock,three children were born, namely, two daughters, who were born in the year 1973, 1974, and one sonwas born in the year 1977. Unfortunately, the son passed away in an accident on 08.09.2002.3. The relationship between the parties became strained in the year 1997. Since 2002, they startedliving separately in the same house on different floors. Respondent-husband occupied the first floor,whereas the appellant- wife along with her two daughters started living on the ground floor. Overthe years, both the daughters have got married and are living in their matrimonial homes. Therespondent-husband preferred the divorce petition in the year 2006. Several grounds allegingcruelty against the appellant-wife were raised in the petition. However, two grounds - which the trialcourt found to have been established, were the following:(a) Respondent-husband alleged that out of his personal income, the appellant-wifehad advanced a loan of Rs. 2 lacs to one of her sisters behind his back, thus leading tohis depravation of the said money when it was required;(b) The appellant-wife and her daughter -RW2 had made allegations, to the effectthat the respondent-husband had molested the daughter and had physically abusedher, which was false and baseless and the said allegation had caused mental cruelty tohim.Sukh Varsha Babbar vs Prem Nath Babbar on 8 September, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35012352/14. To establish the first ground aforesaid, the respondent appears to have filed the photocopy of theletter dated 04.11.1999 (Ex.PW1/B) claimed to have been sent by Shri Manohar Lal, brother-in-lawof the respondent- husband (brother of the appellant) to Smt. Krishna Devi - the sister of theappellant and Shri Manohar Lal. In this communication, Manohar Lal records that Smt. KrishnaDevi had taken a loan from the appellant, which has not been returned.5. Pertinently, this document though filed by the respondent, was not led in evidence by him in hisexamination-in-chief filed on affidavit. However, during his cross-examination, he volunteered tostate that he has annexed the letter received by him through registered post, sent by hisbrother-in-law to support his case that a sum of Rs. 2 lacs have been advanced by the appellant-wifeto her sister. When the said document was sought to be led in evidence as Ex.PW1/B, theappellant-wife had raised her objection as to the mode of proof. It was also suggested that this letteris forged and fabricated. The respondent admitted that he had not mentioned about his letter in hisaffidavit by way of evidence, but denied that the said letter was an after-thought. The respondentstated that the appellant used to visit her real sister to receive money, without informing therespondent-husband anything.6. The learned ADJ relied upon Ex.PW1/B to hold that the said ground of cruelty aforesaid stoodestablished. He observed that once the letter has been placed on record and exhibited without anyobjection as to its authenticity, it fell heavily on the appellant to prove otherwise. The fact that theappellant had not examined her brother to prove that the said letter was not written by him, andthat it was a forged document, was taken against the appellant. The learned ADJ also held thecircumstance, that the appellant did not examine her sister, goes against the appellant.7. The approach of the learned ADJ on the aforesaid aspect is completely misplaced. Firstly, therespondent did not lead in evidence the said document marked Ex.PW1/B, which was filed by him,in his examination-in-chief. Secondly, he only produced a photocopy of the said letter. Thirdly, heclaimed that he had received the said letter by registered post from his brother-in-law. However, hedid not produce the registered cover in which the said letter was purportedly received from hisbrother-in- law. Fourthly, and most importantly, he did not produce the author of the said letter toprove the writing of the said letter - that would have been the primary evidence to prove the saiddocument. Fifthly, the said letter was not authored by the appellant wife, and its contents could notbe held to have been proved against the appellant. It was essential for the respondent toindependently prove the giving of loan by the appellant to her sister.8. In his testimony, the respondent did not even state that he recognized the writing of hisbrother-in-law, and that the said letter has been written in the handwriting of his brother-in-law.Even otherwise, a perusal of Ex.PW1/B shows that the same has been written in devnagari scriptand at the end it appears to bear the name (Manohar Lal) but does not appear to contain hissignatures. It is also pertinent to note that a perusal of Ex.PW1/B by itself does not lead to theconclusion that the appellant had advanced the loan, or that the respondent-husband was not awareof the factum of advancing of the alleged loan of Rs. 2 lacs by the appellant to her sister, or the saidloan had been advanced secretly behind the respondents back. It is also highly debatable whethersuch a conduct, even if indulged by the appellant-wife, would tantamount to cruelty. Thus, in mySukh Varsha Babbar vs Prem Nath Babbar on 8 September, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35012352/2view, the said ground of cruelty has not been made out and to that extent, the impugned judgmentcannot be sustained.9. However, the position is quite different when one examines the second ground of cruelty allegedby the respondent-husband. The allegation made by the appellant-wife against therespondent-husband was that he had molested and physically abused his grown-up daughter. Thesaid allegation, if not established, would tantamount to a very serious false charge against therespondent-husband/father made by the appellant and her grownup daughter - of a fathermolesting and physically abusing his daughter. Such an allegation strikes at the very root of therelationship between, not only the father and his daughter, but also between the husband and thewife - particularly when the said allegation has been made by the appellant wife and the daughterRW2 has testified in support thereof. Such an allegation is completely destructive of the saidrelationships, as the insinuation is amongst the worst kind of character assassination that ahusband/father can be subjected to. Such an allegation, if false, would lead to immense agony,anguish and pain to the husband/ father, which would have the effect of damaging the matrimonialfabric beyond repair.10. In this regard, the appellant had produced RW2 -her daughter as her witness, who had filed heraffidavit by way of her examination-in-chief as Ex.RW2/A. She stated that the respondent is guiltyof various acts of cruelty against her as well as her mother. She, inter alia, stated that on someoccasions, the respondent had physically abused and molested her and her sister while he was underthe influence of liquor. She stated that she was molested by the respondent and he even removed allclothes worn by him, including his undergarments. She stated that on 01.10.2002, when she wasleaving for her office in the morning, she was molested and physically abused by the respondent andthat when the appellant intervened, both of them were given beatings for at least 10 minutes, andthat she had to call the police to save herself. She stated that the respondent and the appellant werebooked under Sections 107/151 Cr.P.C. and later on, the mother i.e. the appellant was granted bailand the respondent-husband was sent to Tihar in jail custody.11. In her cross-examination, RW2 stated that her educational qualification is M.Sc. (Mathematics).RW2 sought to explain the meaning of the expressions, physical abuse and molestation asunderstood by her, as meaning the giving of beatings and physical manhandling. She also statedduring the course of her cross-examination that on 01.10.2002, the incident of molestation andphysically abuse had taken place when she was on her way to work at about 8.00 p.m. as the dutywas in the night shift.12. The learned ADJ has found in favour of the respondent-husband and disbelieved the testimonyof the appellant and RW2 on the said allegation. The learned ADJ observed that molestation andphysically abuse are strongly suggestive of sexual abuse and reflected upon the character of theperson against whom such words are used. In relation to the incident of 01.10.2002, the learnedADJ observed that on the one hand, RW2 had claimed that she was going to the office in themorning when the said incident of molestation and physical abuse had taken place at the hands ofthe respondent-father while, on the other hand, in her cross-examination she had, inter alia, stated:Sukh Varsha Babbar vs Prem Nath Babbar on 8 September, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35012352/3"On 1.10.02, I was working with E-funds as a Team Member and the office of thesame is in Gurgaon. On the said day, I was leaving for my office at around 8.00 p.m.,it was my night shift duty. It is wrong to suggest that on 01.10.02, the cause of fightbetween petitioner and us was that we had forged a No Objection Certificate ofpetitioner for claiming dues of our deceased brother." (Emphasis supplied)13. Thus, there was a serious contradiction in the testimony of RW2 with regard to the time of theincident. The appellant had not produced the case claimed to have been registered under Sections107/151 Cr.P.C. post the incident of physical abuse and molestation, which allegedly took place on01.10.2002.14. RW2 sought to explain her understanding of the expressions, molestation" and "physical abuseby stating:"The meaning of physically abused as mentioned in my affidavit is that my fatherused to pounce on me and started giving beatings. The meaning of molestation asmentioned in my affidavit is that physical manhandling of the petitioner with me.The meaning of the words in my affidavit that I was telling my father not tomisbehave with us for the last ten years, starts from 1992. We are not residingtogether and are not in talking since the year 2002."15. The learned ADJ sought to give the benefit of doubt to RW2 about her understanding of the saidexpressions, by concluding that the allegations, in any event, did not relate to sexual abuse/sexualassault. However, in my view, the other allegations made by RW2 in her examination-in-chief, donot support the explanation sought to be furnished by her in her cross- examination with regard toher understanding of the expressions, physical abuse and molestation. As noted above, the saidwitness had, inter alia, stated that the respondent had molested her inasmuch, as, he removed all hisclothes including his undergarments. Thus, it cannot be said that RW2 was not aware of themeaning of the expressions, molestation and physical abuse as having sexual connotations, or thatshe understood the said expressions to mean only "physical beatings" and "manhandling". She ishaving a post-graduate qualification in Mathematics and being a mature person, would be aware ofthe true meaning of the said expressions. Thus, in my view, the findings returned by the learnedADJ with regard to the perpetration of cruelty by the appellant on the respondent, premised on thefalse allegation of molestation and physical abuse of RW2 is correct, and does not call forinterference.16. Reliance placed by the learned counsel for the appellant on Subhash Chander Sharma Vs. AnjaliSharma 174(2010) DLT 564, in my view, is of no avail. In this decision, this Court has taken note ofthe legal position that irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground recognized as a groundfor divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. Reliance was placed in this regard on Neelam Kumar Vs.Dayarani II (2010) DMC 198 (SC). However, in the present case, firstly the learned ADJ has notpassed a decree of divorce, and secondly, the relief of judicial separation granted to therespondent-husband is not premised on irretrievable break down of marriage. The same is premisedon a finding of cruelty.Sukh Varsha Babbar vs Prem Nath Babbar on 8 September, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35012352/417. As discussed hereinabove, the ground of cruelty, though not made out in relation to theallegation of appellant advancing the loan of Rs. 2 lacs to her sister without the knowledge of therespondent, it is established in relation to a more serious charge of the respondent-husbandphysically abusing and molesting the grownup daughter RW2.18. The learned ADJ has in his discretion granted judicial separation instead of a decree of divorce.The respondent-husband has not assailed the said judgment and decree by either filing a separateappeal, or by raising any cross-objections in the present appeal. Accordingly, I find no merit in thisappeal and dismiss the same leaving the parties to bear their respective costs.19. The appeal stands disposed of.VIPIN SANGHI, J SEPTEMBER 08, 2015 slSukh Varsha Babbar vs Prem Nath Babbar on 8 September, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35012352/5
