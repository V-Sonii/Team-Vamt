Defence Counsels by way of their verbal submissions as well as written argumentsopposed the case of the Prosecution.State vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/11I have considered the rival submissions made before me in the light of evidence of record.The age of the victim 'US' was established by way of testimony of PW12, 13 and 14. They exhibitedbirth certificate of the Prosecutrix, as per which her date of birth is 14.2.93. The said certificate is Ex.PW12/A.PW12 the Executive Assistant of the concerned Gram Panchayat also produced the original registerregarding registration of birth of Anganwari worker of Shamali Sardar, Bayermari Gangdhar para,ICDS Centre. The entry regarding date of birth of the Prosecutrix is Ex. PW12/C.Similarly, PW13 Rekha Mridha who was Panchayat Pradhan from 05.7.03 to 03.7.08 also provedbirth certificate Ex. PW12/A and entry in the register of birth Ex. PW12/C.PW15 also corroborated the testimony of PW12 and 13 regarding date of birth of Prosecutrix 'US'. Inview of the aforesaid documentary as well as oral deposition of the said witness, I find that theProsecution been able to prove that date of birth of Prosecutrix is 14.2.93.I find myself unable to accept the arguments of the Defenec that since Prosecutrix had herself statedher date of birth to the examining doctor at the time of medical examination to be 18 years, theProsecutrix was major at the time of the incident in question. Moreover, the factum that theProsecutrix 'US' herself was unable to recall her date of birth also does not affect the case of theprosecution adversely in view of the documentary evidence brought on record by the prosecution. Itis not the plea of the Defence that there is no kind of manipulation in the said record regarding herdate of birth. In the light of the aforesaid, I am of the opinion that it had been proved on record thatdate of birth of the Prosecutrix 'US' was 14.2.93.In order to establish the fact that Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi deceitfully procured theProsecutrix PW1 from lawful custody of Nepal Sardar reference may be made again to the testimonyof PW1 'US'. In her testimony, she clearly deposed that though she was taken by Sunil Jha forattending to his parents, his parents were not residing on the upper floor and only they wereresiding in that house. PW5 Shaymal Mehto @ Samuel and PW8 Nepal Sardar also deposed thatAccused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi had asked for placement of two girls one for themselves andanother for their parents.The fact that PW1 was placed in the house of Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi as maid servant alsostands established from the deposition of PW8 Nepal Sardar and PW5 Shyamal Mehto. Both thewitnesses have proved that the form of the placement agency bear the photograph of the Prosecutrixas well as signatures of Accused Sunil Jha.Although the Accused persons though in their statement recorded under Section 313 CrPC havecategorically denied this piece of evidence. However, neither any contradictions could be elicited inthe Prosecution regarding deployment of 'US' in the house of Accused Sunil Jha.State vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/12I also find myself unable to accept the contention of Defence that prosecution has failed to prove theoffence punishable under Section 366A IPC against Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi. It wascontended by Ld. Defence Counsel that admittedly PW8 Nepal Sardar was not present in hisplacement agency when Sunil Jha allegedly took the Prosecutrix PW1 along with him. My attentionwas drawn to the examination in chief of PW8 wherein he deposed that Accused Sunil Jha came tohis office when he was not present there and Samuel sent girl 'US' with Sunil Jha. It was contendedthat in these circumstances, case of the Prosecution becomes doubtful and the offence punishableunder Section 366A IPC cannot be established against Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi.On the other hand, Ld. SPP for CBI pointed out that from the testimony of the Prosecutrix PW1,PW5 and PW8, it has been clearly established that Prosecutrix was taken from the office ofplacement agency run by Nepal Sardar by Accused Sunil Jha. The witnesses have also deposed thatSunil Jha falsely stated that he requires two girls, one for themselves and the other for taking care ofhis aged parents who were not residing in his house. I am unable to agree with the Defence thatsince Nepal Sardar was not present in his office when Accused Sunil Jha took away the minor girlalong with him, the offence under Section 366A cannot be made out against the Accused persons. Inas much as it has been proved on record that it is Accused Sunil Jha who took away the minor girlalong with him from the placement agency run by PW8 Nepal Sardar.PW2 Payal Mondal deposed before the court that one day Accused Sunil Jha had took PW1 'US'outside the house on the pretext of outing and returned in the night without 'US' and when sheasked about 'US', they told her that she has been put to work somewhere else. PW1 'US' herself alsodeposed that she was taken on the pretext of outing by Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi wherethey met one lady and two boys were standing at some distance. She also deposed that she was madeto sit in another vehicle along with said lady and two boys and when she asked Sunil Jha and JhalkiDevi as to why they were not sitting along with her, they replied that they would come in anothervehicle.The driver of the TATA Sumo i.e. PW9 Anil Kumar deposed that on 02.3.10, Ram Kunwar bookedKunwar, Titu, Subhash Kumar, Prem Kumar and other two persons came to Delhi in his vehicle andremained at Peeragarhi for around 20 minutes. He correctly identified Accused Subhash andRampal @ Titu. He further deposed that on 03.3.10, they booked his vehicle to go to Rohtak at theman and one lady alongwith one girl. Witness correctly identified Accused Jhalki Devi and Sunilexamination, the witness also produced his driving licence.The case of the prosecution is further strengthened from the deposition of PW11 Naresh, PW15Balbir and PW17 Ram Kunwar. As discussed hereinabove, in their detailed deposition before thecourt, these three witness categorically deposed regarding purchase of PW1 'US' from Accused SunilJha and Jhalki Devi for the purpose of her marriage with Accused Rampal @ Titu. All thesewitnesses correctly identified Accused Sunil Jha, Jhalki Devi, Subhash and Rampal @ Titu and alsodeposed that Prosecutrix PW1 had refused to marry Accused Rampal @ Titu.State vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/13In the deposition of PW17, he has clearly stated that after reaching Khedar, Prosecutrix againrefused to marry Accused Rampal @ Titu. He also deposed that in the night girl 'US' was sent in aroom for sleeping where Accused Titu had also entered for the purpose of sleeping with her andafter sometime, 'US' rushed out of the room while crying and was also trying to escape from theirhouse in the night. He also deposed that they consoled her with great difficulty and asked her as towhat happened to her, then she told that she do not want to sleep with Accused Titu and on this heand his wife asked her to sleep with his wife and on that night, 'US' slept with his wife in a separateroom.He also deposed that Accused Subhash had sought sometime to persuade Prosecutrix to marry withAccused Titu. Prosecutrix PW1 in her deposition deposed that she was forced to marry with AccusedRampal @ Titu. She also deposed that when she tried to go out of the room then Rampal @ Titu andone other person i.e. Subhash (correctly identified by the witness) caught hold of her and draggedher inside the room.In her deposition, PW1 also deposed that Accused Subhash took her to the house of his relative onhis bike where he molested her and also threatened that if she will not marry, she would be killed.The deposition of the Prosecutrix PW1 coupled with the testimony of PW11 Naresh also clearlyestablishes that Accused Sunil Jha persuaded PW1 and she agreed to marry Accused Rampal @ Tituunder pressure.During the course of arguments, Ld. Defence Counsel strongly argued that prosecution has failed toprove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It was contended that Prosecutrix as well as PW2 Payal didexamination, PW1 admitted that she was briefed by the police officials before making her statement.It was further pointed out that at no point of time, Prosecutrix PW1 raised alarm against her allegedillegal confinement or sexual exploitation at the hands of the Accused persons.I have considered the aforesaid arguments. However, I find that the mere fact that PW1, 2 and 3failed to recall the aforesaid dates during their deposition, cannot make their testimony unworthy ofcredit. It has been proved on record, as discussed above that Prosecutrix was below 18 years of ageat the time of commission of the alleged offence. From her testimony, it has already been borne outthat PW1 was native of West Bengal and the fact that she could not state anything about the locationof house of Sunil Jha cannot make her testimony doubtful. Further, the mere fact that she admittedthat she was briefed by the police officials before making her statement, does not imply that her"It is wrong to suggest that I have been tutored by someone regarding my deposition in court." It isalso pertinent to note that the deposition of PW1 is duly corroborated from the deposition of theother prosecution witnesses who have correctly identified Accused persons and have also deposedregarding confinement and the 'so called' marriage of the Prosecutrix PW1 with Accused Rampal @Titu under threat.State vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/14At this juncture, it may also be relevant to refer to judgment relied upon by Ld. SPP for CBI inrespect of his argument titled as Mrityunjay Kumar Vs State of Sikkim 2010 Crl. L. J. 44. In the saidjudgment, it has been held by Hon'ble High Court "It cannot be said that like in the case of criminalforce confinement had to necessarily have physical manifestation. Confinement need not necessarilybe a confinement where the person is physically held within a certain circumscribed limit. Tosupport the charge of wrongful confinement, proof of actual physical obstruction is not essential. Itis the condition of the mind of the person confined, having regard to the circumstance that leadshim to reasonable believe that he was not free to move and that he would be forthwith restrained ifhe attempted to do so."It also cannot be lost sight of that not only Prosecutrix but also prosecution witnesses includingrelatives of the Accused particularly PW11 Naresh has also supported the case of the Prosecution.PW17 Ram Kunwar has deposed regarding refusal to marry with Accused Rampal @ Titu by PW1and her subsequent surrender under the treat extended to her by Accused persons. The consent formarriage with Accused Rampal @ Titu by PW1 in these circumstances was certainly obtained underthe fear. It has been thus proved on record that the Prosecutrix continued to remain under threat ofAccused persons. She even alleged molestation at the hands of Accused Subhash and in thesecircumstances, it cannot be reasonably expected from a minor girl that she would try to raise analarm or to escape. It must also be kept in mind that Prosecutrix belonged to a village of WestBengal and was subjected to sexual exploitation, forced and illegal confinement and was thus underconstant mental pressure and threat.examination that "It is correct that when I stay there I talked with the neighbourers. I cooked foodfor the family members where I was staying. I did not talk to anybody who came to that house. I alsoserved the food to the animals." It was further argued that the deposition of the Prosecutrix cannotescape or raise an alarm, thus implying that case against Accused is false.However, upon going through the deposition of the Prosecutrix PW1 in its entirety, I find myselfunable to accept this argument of the Defence. It is noteworthy that the Prosecutrix PW1 on morethan one occasion in her testimony deposed before the court that she had been threatened byAccused Rampal @ Titu. In her examination in chief dated 19.10.11, PW1 deposed that "In the nightAccused Rampal threatened me that if I would not settle with him then he will sell me to an oldman. In that night Accused Rampal forcibly made physical relation with me against my wishes andalso threatened me to say that I am living with him with my own consent if anyone inquires."Further, in response to question put to the witness by the Prosecution, she replied that "He madephysical relations with me daily without my consent by threatening that I would be killed if I will notsubject to his wishes."Similarly, with regard to argument of the Defence that she did not raise an alarm when AccusedSubhash took her on a bike to house of his relative and molested her, as deposed by PW1, I find ongoing through her examination in chief itself that Prosecutrix clearly deposed that "There AccusedSubhash molested me and also threatened me that if I would not marry, I would be killed." TheState vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/15testimony of PW1 to this extent, is totally unrebutted as not even a single suggestion was given toI thus find upon considering the evidence on record that obviously the Prosecutrix was thus undercontinuous threat and pressure and in these circumstances the fact that she succumbed before theAccused persons and did not resist their illegal sexual advances towards her, cannot by any meansimply that she was a consenting party. I am supported in my view by judgment of Hon'ble ApexCourt titled as Satpal Singh Vs State of Haryana 2010 Crl. L. J. 4283 wherein it has been held that"Consent implies the exercise of a free and untrammelled right to forbid or withhold what is beingconsented to, it always is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is proposed to be done byanother and concurred in by the former. An act of helplessness on the fact of inevitable compulsionsis not consent in law. More so, it is not necessary that there should be actual use of force. A threat oruse of force is sufficient."Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in various pronouncements including case titled as State of PunjabVs Gurmit Singh and Others 1996 Crl. L. J. 1728 has repeatedly laid down that "The Courts must,would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as isinvolved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposedconsiderations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or evendiscrepancies in the statement of the Prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are suchwhich are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Theinherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression arefacts which the Courts should not overlook." It was further laid down that "The Courts should findno difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an Accused whereher testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of herstatement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury.Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, beviewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion?"In the light of the above discussion, the evidence on record and the relevant case law, as discussedabove, I find that Prosecution has been able to prove that Accused Sunil Jha, Jhalki Devi, Subhashand Rampal @ Titu had entered into criminal conspiracy between January, 2010 to May, 2010 andin furtherance of the said criminal conspiracy they removed the Prosecutrix 'US' from lawful custodyfor monitory consideration knowing that Prosecutrix 'US' would be subjected to physical torture,The plea of the Accused regarding their false implication due to their enmity with Nepal Sardar,remained unsubstantiated on record and no evidence whatsoever has led by the Defence to provethis contention.Hence, I find in the light of evidence on record that all the aforesaid Accused persons are liable to beState vs 1) Sunil Kumar Jha on 9 April, 2013Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20924194/16are accordingly convicted for the same.Prosecution has examined PW21 Ramesh B. Assistant Manager, Karnataka Bank Ltd. BangaloreHowever, there is not an iota of evidence on record to establish that money in the said account wasreceived by Accused Sunil Jha by selling of girls. Further, although, by examining DW1 and DW2,Accused Sunil Jha and Jhalki Devi have failed to establish their plea that said money was receivedafter selling their plot of land since the original documents of sale were not produced by thewitnesses, yet in view of the evidence led by the prosecution, I find that allegations in thechargesheet to the extent that the said amount was received by them by selling girls, have not beenestablished on record.I may hasten to add at this juncture that prosecution has, however, established on record theallegations against above named Accused that they not only deceitfully procured the Prosecutrix 'US'from lawful custody of PW8 Nepal Sardar after which the Prosecutrix was sold for monitoryknowing that Prosecutrix 'US' would be subjected to physical torture, illegal confinement and haveJha and Jhalki Devi are convicted for offence punishable under Section 506/344/366A IPC besidesthe aforesaid offences.Further, Accused Subhash and Rampal @ Titu are convicted for offence punishable under Section344 IPC. However, for want of any evidence that Prosecutrix was given any beatings by the Accusedduring her illegal confinement, the above named Accused are acquitted for offence punishable underSection 323 IPC. Besides the aforesaid, Accused Rampal @ Titu is also convicted for offencepunishable under Section 376 IPC for having raped the Prosecutrix 'US' while keeping her in illegalconfinement.All the Accused persons be heard on the point of sentence.
