She further denied the suggestion that appellant was not having a good character andhe was in the habit of teasing the prosecutrix on earlier occasion also.15. DW-2, Ms. Kusum Jain, w/o Sh. Achal Kumar Jain, deposed that the appellant was her tenant inthe year 2004. She further deposed that she used to frequently visit the above house and that MadhuJain is her Bhabhi. DW-2 deposed that she knew the appellant Sumit since childhood and he was aboy of very good character. She used to go in the above house almost daily and at times she used tostay there in the night also. On the night of the incident i.e. 29/30.07.2004, she was sleeping in theSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/5house of her Bhabhi. She further deposed that on that date she and her Bhabhi were sleeping on theroof and that she had not seen any incident of the prosecutrix coming out of the room of theappellant on that night. She woke up after hearing the commotion and noise of the voice of father ofthe prosecutrix, scolding her as to where was she going in the middle of the night. The time wasnearly 12 in the night. DW-2 deposed that the father of the appellant on his own called number 100from the phone of a neighbour in spite of their telling him not to do so. DW-2 further deposed thatthe prosecutrix is of unstable mind and mentally not fit and that she used to go on her own to anyplace or any where. The appellant had no affair with the prosecutrix and had never tried to molesther. DW-2 has denied that on the night of 29/30.04.2009 the appellant had made any attempteither to molest or rape the prosecutrix in his room.16. In her cross-examination by the learned counsel for the State, DW-2 deposed that the appellant was mentally unstable and was getting treatment fromGTB Hospital, and this was told to her by the mother of the prosecutrix. She deniedthe suggestion that she was deposing falsely to save the appellant as he belonged toher native village. She further denied the suggestion that she did not stay at herpremises during the night of 29/30.04.2004. She further deposed that she did not goto the police station and told the SHO that the appellant has been falsely implicatedin the present case. She voluntarily deposed that the policeman who had arrested theappellant had made an enquiry from her and she had told him that the incident ofalleged rape was false.17. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that both the judgment and the order on convictionpassed by the learned ASJ are perverse, arbitrary and based on whims, conjectures and possibilities.In fact the appellant has been convicted in the absence of any evidence against him and thejudgment is against law and facts of the case. It is the case of the learned counsel for the appellantthat the prosecutrix has alleged that when she was sleeping in-between her parents and beside hersister and brother on the roof of the third floor of the house measuring thirty seven sq. ft., and whereother inmates of the house were also sleeping, therefore it was not possible for the appellant, towake her up, gag her mouth and take her to his second floor rented tiny accommodation. More so,when there is no allegation of holding of any weapon by the appellant.18. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that if it is assumed that the incident actually tookplace, then the prosecutrix could have raised an alarm, or could have shouted and cried for help.Further if she was being taken by the appellant to his second floor room, then while going there alsoshe could have raised an alarm, or the prosecutrix could have even raised an alarm inside the room.The threat by closing the mouth is imaginary and is not possible. Learned counsel submits that asper the statement of the mother of the prosecutrix, the younger brother of the appellant, Manish wasalso in the room where the prosecutrix was allegedly taken. However, there is no possibility that aperson would dare to commit rape with a girl in front of his own real younger brother.19. It was next contended by learned counsel for the appellant that except the parents of theprosecutrix, the I.O. did not examine any other inmates of the building who were also sleeping onSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/6the roof on the night of the alleged incident. So much so that he did not even examine the brotherand sister of the prosecutrix, nor were they produced in the Court. Similarly, the brother of theappellant was not examined. The FIR of this case was lodged on the basis of the oral testimony ofthe prosecutrix, yet her statement was not recorded under Section 164, Cr.P.C., which clearlyestablishes that the report was lodged only at the instance of the father of the prosecutrix. It is statedthat a possibility cannot be ruled out that the father of the prosecutrix was holding a grudge againstthe appellant and thus wanted to implicate him. He submits that though the intimation over thephone to the police was about teasing, which was duly recorded by the police in its D.D., but by thetime the girl was taken to the Police Station, a rape case was registered against the appellant, whichwas clearly an afterthought of the father of the prosecutrix.20. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that even if the story of the offence of rape is true,then the prosecutrix may have also resisted and there should have been signs of resistance andinjuries. However, in the instant case, no injuries or even bruises were found on the person of theprosecutrix or on the appellant herein. In the medical examination, the hymen of the prosecutrixwas found intact and PW-11, the doctor, in her statement before the Court, completely ruled out thepossibility of rape. Furthermore, the underwear of the prosecutrix and the half pant worn by theappellant along with vaginal smears slides were sent for examination and were found negative forsemen. There was only a salwar, allegedly worn by the prosecutrix, which was found positive forsemen. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Apex Court in the case of SadashivRamrao Hadbe v. State of Maharashtra reported at (2006) 10 SCC 92 has held that presence ofsemen on even the undergarment could only raise some suspicion on the conduct of the appellant,and when no injury is found on the body or private part of the prosecutrix, the appellant wasentitled to acquittal. It is contended by the learned counsel that the undergarments of theprosecutrix were not found positive for semen and as such a finding that the salwar was foundpositive for semen, has no significance in light of the fact that the girl was living with her marriedmother and the salwar could have been worn inadvertently or may be deliberately, semen was puton the salwar at the instance of the father of the prosecutrix, so as to falsely implicate the appellant.21. Learned counsel for the appellant has further assailed the judgment on the ground that neitherthere is any allegation by the prosecutrix nor has the doctor opined that there was any penetrationor even an attempt of penetration by the appellant. Whereas, to constitute an offence of rape,penetration is sine qua non. The Apex Court in the case of Aman Kumar Vs. State of Haryanareported at 2004 SCC (Crl.) 1266 has held that if in the evidence of the prosecutrix or Doctor, thereis no specific mention of penetration, then the offence of rape is not made out. Moreover, theindependent witnesses (DW-1 and DW-2) have clearly stated that no such incident ofrape/molestation had ever taken place. The prosecutrix and her parents were examined and thereare major contradictions in the three statements of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3, which itself show that nosuch incident, as alleged, had taken place.22. Per Contra, learned counsel for the State submits that the case against the appellant has beenestablished beyond any shadow of doubt. Learned APP submits that it is not necessary that thevictim should have raised an alarm when the appellant came near her cot, for the reason thatdifferent persons react differently in such a situation, especially when the appellant had threatenedSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/7her that if she would raise an alarm, he will kill her. It is contended by him that the version of theprosecutrix, that rape was committed upon her by the appellant, is duly supported by the evidenceof her mother and father. There is no requirement that the victim should have described the incidentin detail, to show that how she had been raped. Furthermore it is submitted by him, that it is notnecessary that in all cases of rape, rupture of hymen takes place. There is scientific evidence to showthe presence of semen on the salwar of the girl. Learned APP submits that the sole statement of thevictim can be the basis of conviction and to look for corroboration is only a rule of prudence andeven otherwise also medical evidence is only an opinion. He relies upon the case of Anil Kumar Vs.State of U.P. reported at 2004 13 SCC 257 in support of his plea that in case oral evidence is credibleand cogent then medical evidence cannot be relied upon.23. The arguments of learned counsel for the appellant can be summarized as under:(1) The allegations of rape are false. The surrounding circumstances belie the case of rape set up bythe prosecution.(2) As per the MLC no rape was committed on the victim. (3) Medical and scientific evidence do notsupport the case of the victim.(4) The prosecutrix has not alleged any penetration by the appellant or even an attempt ofpenetration.(5) The independent witnesses DW-1 and DW-2 have clearly stated that there is no incident of rape,which took place on the fateful night.24. The argument of learned APP for the State can be summarized as under:1. The evidence of the prosecutrix is reliable and does not require any corroboration.2. The evidence of the victim is duly supported by the evidence of her parents.3. It is not necessary to describe the incident in detail and medical evidence is only an opinion.25. In this case, the prosecutrix along with her family members, used to live as a tenant on theground floor of a three storey building. On the midnight of 30.07.2004, the prosecutrix was sleepingon the roof of the said tenanted building, along with her family members i.e. her mother, father,sister and younger brother. Other tenants of the very building were also sleeping on the roof of thesaid house. While the prosecutrix was sleeping on the cot, she felt that someone was standing nearher cot. She found the person to be the appellant, who threatened her to not raise any alarm.Thereafter, the appellant gagged her mouth, took her down-stairs to his room, bolted the room frominside, opened her salwar and raped her. The examination-in-chief of PW-2, the prosecutrix isreproduced below:Sumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/8"[o]n 29.7.2004, I was living in Gorakhpark on the ground floor of the house. Theaccused alongwith his brother Manish used to live on the second floor of the samehouse. The accused used to stare at me and my father rebuked him a number oftimes. On the day of incident I was sleeping on the roof of the house with my familymembers. I was sleeping on a cot. I felt that someone was standing near my cot. Theaccused present before the Court was standing there. He gagged my mouth and tookme down stairs. He took me to his room. He bolted the door from inside. He openedmy salwar and raped me. I went upstairs holding my salwar and informed myparents. Tinku and my father were on the roof. The accused threatened me that incase I disclosed about it to my parents, he will kill me. My parents called the police.My statement, Ex.PW-2/A was recorded by the police which bears my signatures atpoint 'A'. I was got medically examined."26. In the case of Madho Ram and Anr. Vs. The State of UP reported at AIR 1973 SC 469, the ApexCourt observed that:"The only rule of law is the rule of prudence, namely, the advisability of corroborationshould be present in the mind of the judge or the jury, as the case may be. There is norule of practice that there must, in every case, be corroboration before the convictioncan be allowed to stand."It would also be useful to reproduce the observations of the Supreme Court in the case of State ofPunjab v. Gurmit Singh reported at (1996) 2 SCC 384. Regarding a rape victim the Apex Court held:"8. .........The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in acase of rape, no self- respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make ahumiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission ofrape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations whichhave no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepanciesin the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are suchwhich are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecutioncase. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage ofsexual aggression are factors which the courts should not overlook. The testimony ofthe victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons whichnecessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the courts should find nodifficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict anaccused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seekingcorroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such casesamounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman whocomplains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief orsuspicion? The court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look forsome assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is awitness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is norequirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base convictionSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/9of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost on a par withthe evidence of an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable........""21. ......It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards theviolation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that arapist not only violates the victims privacy and personal integrity, but inevitablycauses serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is notmerely a physical assault -- it is often destructive of the whole personality of thevictim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the verysoul of the helpless female. The courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibilitywhile trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases withutmost sensitivity. The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case andnot get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in thestatement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out anotherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspiresconfidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement inmaterial particulars. If for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicitreliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to hertestimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. Thetestimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire caseand the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealingwith cases involving sexual molestations."[Emphasis supplied] "22. ......The provisions of Evidence Act regarding relevancy offacts notwithstanding, some defence counsel adopt the strategy of continualquestioning of the prosecutrix as to the details of the rape. The victim is required torepeat again and again the details of the rape incident not so much as to bring out thefacts on record or to test her credibility but to test her story for inconsistencies with aview to attempt to twist the interpretation of events given by her so as to make themappear inconsistent with her allegations. The court, therefore, should not sit as asilent spectator while the victim of crime is being cross-examined by the defence. Itmust effectively control the recording of evidence in the court. While every latitudeshould be given to the accused to test the veracity of the prosecutrix and thecredibility of her version through cross-examination, the court must also ensure thatcross-examination is not made a means of harassment or causing humiliation to thevictim of crime. A victim of rape, it must be remembered, has already undergone atraumatic experience and if she is made to repeat again and again, in unfamiliarsurroundings what she had been subjected to, she may be too ashamed and evennervous or confused to speak and her silence or a confused stray sentence may bewrongly interpreted as "discrepancies and contradictions" in her evidence."27. Thus in the case of State of Punjab (supra), the Apex Court has observed that the court should besensitive while dealing with a case involving sexual molestation. Rape is not merely a physicalassault, it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A word of caution has come toSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/10ensure that during cross- examination when the victim is required to repeat again and again thedetails of the rape incident, the Court should not sit as a silent spectator, to allow the victim to beharassed, humiliated, while she is asked to repeat her traumatic experience. In the same vein theApex Court has also held that every latitude should be given to the accused to test the veracity of theprosecutrix and the credibility of her version through cross-examination. There is no quarrel withthe proposition of law that a victim of rape is not an accomplice; her testimony can be acted uponwithout corroboration in material particulars; a victim of rape is treated at a higher pedestal than aninjured person; and a conviction in a rape case can safely be awarded on the sole testimony of theprosecutrix. But the caveat here is that her version should also be reliable, trustworthy and shouldinspire confidence and in case the Court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony,it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony. Coming to the facts of this case,it is observed that a bare reading of the testimony of PW-2, prosecutrix would show that on thefateful night, she was sleeping in-between her parents, when the appellant allegedly woke her up,gagged her mouth and took her down-stairs to his room. In my considered opinion, the testimony ofthe prosecutrix is unreliable and unbelievable and the whole incident seems to be highlyimprobable. On the fateful night, the victim was admittedly sleeping on the roof by the side of herfather and in-between her parents. Other family members and tenants were also sleeping on theroof. The roof of the plot measured at about 37 sq. feet, so there cannot be much distance betweenthe cots of persons sleeping on the roof. In this backdrop the version of the victim is that theappellant was standing near her cot in the night, gagged her, took her down stairs and thereafterraped her. The version of the victim is also that she did not raise an alarm on her being woken upand taken downstairs from the roof where she was sleeping in the presence of her entire family.28. To a question put to PW-2, prosecutrix, no reply was given by her.The question reads that:"Q. When the accused opened the cord of your salwar, why you did not cry, at thattime.A. The question was asked thrice, but the witness did not reply."29. At any stage, the prosecutrix did not raise any alarm or cried for help, except after the allegedrape had been committed upon her. As per the version by the prosecutrix, after she had been rapedby the appellant, she came to the roof, and informed her parents about rape having been committedupon her. PW-2 stated:"He opened my Salwar and raped me. I went upstairs holding my salwar andinformed my parents. Tinku and my father were on the roof. "30. It is pertinent to note that although PW-1, father of the prosecutrix has supported the case set upby the prosecution, but there is a material contradiction between the version given by PW-1 (fatherof the prosecutrix) and PW-2 (prosecutrix) with regard to the fact as to when did he get to knowabout rape. Relevant portion of the testimony of PW-1 is reproduced hereunder:Sumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/11"The accused asked my son Tinku as to what had happened. My daughter was in theroom of the accused. He spared my daughter and she came out holding her SALWAR.My daughter told me that she had been raped by the accused which she had resistedbut the accused did not agree."31. In her cross-examination by learned counsel for the appellant, PW-2 has stated:"I was sleeping on the roof by the side of my father. I was sleeping in between myparents. I did not raise alarm because accused had threatened, if I woke up myparents, he will kill me. I did not raise any alarm from the roof till reaching the roomof the accused."32. Thus it is seen that in the cross-examination, the prosecutrix says that she did not raise anyalarm because the appellant had threatened her that if she woke up her parents, he would kill her. Ithas been submitted by the learned counsel for the State that different people react differently insimilar situations. Be that as it may, according to the version of the prosecutrix, she got so scared bythe alleged threat extended by the appellant, that instead of crying for help, she got up from her cotand quietly went to the room of the appellant. I find the version of the prosecutrix to be absolutelyunnatural and false on account of the fact that she being a matured sixteen year old girl, sleepingin-between the comfort and safety of her parents, got scared by the alleged utterance of an unarmedperson that she ought to go with him, else she would be killed. Even if the prosecutrix had voiced asingle word or even whispered, her father and mother sleeping next to her would have woken up or,other family members of the prosecutrix who were also sleeping on the same roof may have wokenup. Even if that may not be so, other tenants of the said building, who were also sleeping on the roofof the said building, may have woken up. According to DW-1, Ms. Madhu Jain, w/o Manoj Jain (atenant in the same building), in July, 2004, the prosecutrix was residing in the house with her fatheras a tenant on the ground floor, and that she was a tenant on the first floor and the appellant was atenant on the second floor. DW-1 has deposed that on the night of 29/30.07.2004, she was sleepingon the roof of the building as it was summer season. And that the prosecutrix and her father werealso sleeping on the roof. She woke up by hearing some noise and saw that the father of theprosecutrix was scolding his daughter as to where was she going in the night. DW-1 has stated thatthe prosecutrix was a girl of unstable mind and she used to enter the rooms of male persons andearlier, two or three times, she had entered in the room of her brother-in-law (Jeth) who had turnedher out. DW-1 has further deposed that the appellant had no affair with the prosecutrix and as perher knowledge, no incident of rape or molestation by the appellant had taken place on the night of29/30.07.2004. She also deposed that the police had not taken her statement.33. DW-2 (land-lady), Ms. Kusum Jain, w/o Sh. Achal Kumar Jain, deposed that the appellant washer tenant in the year 2004. According to DW-2, she knew the appellant since childhood and he wasa boy of very good character. She further deposed that she used to frequently visit the above houseand at times she also used to stay there in the night. On the night of the incident i.e. 29/30.07.2004,she was sleeping along with DW-1 on the roof of the said building and that no such incident of rapehad taken place. In her cross-examination DW-2 has deposed that the prosecutrix was of unstablemind and that she used to go on her own to any place or anywhere. And that the prosecutrix wasSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/12getting her treatment done from GTB Hospital, and this fact was told to her by the mother of theprosecutrix. DW-2 denied the suggestion that she was deposing falsely to save the appellant andfurther denied the suggestion that she did not stay at her premises during the night of29/30.04.2004.34. In the case before me, both DW-1 and DW-2, who along with the prosecutrix and her familymembers were also sleeping on the small roof of the said building, have completely denied thehappening of any incident of teasing by the appellant, much less that of rape. Rather they have goneon to say that the prosecutrix, was of unstable mind. It would be relevant to note that in the case ofState of Haryana v. Ram Singh reported at (2002) 2 SCC 426 the Apex Court has held that defencewitnesses are entitled to the same weight as that of prosecution witnesses. The Court observed:"Incidentally, be it noted that the evidence tendered by defence witnesses cannotalways be termed to be a tainted one -- the defence witnesses are entitled to equaltreatment and equal respect as that of the prosecution. The issue of credibility andthe trustworthiness ought also to be attributed to the defence witnesses on a par withthat of the prosecution."35. The two defence witnesses, were cross-examined at length, but they did not budge from theirstand that the appellant was innocent and have withstood the cross-examination.36. For the reasons stated above, I do not find the version of the prosecutrix to be reliable, hence theappellant cannot be convicted solely on the testimony of the prosecutrix. I would not hesitate to addherein that in such circumstances where the testimony and the version of the prosecutrix aredifficult to accept, the Court must look at evidence which may at least lend assurance to thetestimony of the victim. In the judgment of the trial court various judgments of the Apex Court havebeen noticed, but reluctantly, I am compelled to notice that while referring to and reproducing theportions of the judgment(s), the learned trial Judge has failed to apply the same to the facts of thiscase. While relying solely on the testimony of the prosecutrix the Court is duty bound to examinesuch testimony minutely, carefully and with great caution and if there is any doubt the Court mustimmediately look for corroboration (corroboration from witnesses, medical evidence or otherscientific evidence). This is the precise situation in this case.37. According to PW-11, Dr. Seema Sharma, a senior gynaecologist of GTB Hospital, who hadprepared the MLC Ex.PW-6/D of the prosecutrix, there was no mark of injury present on the personof the prosecutrix, when she had examined her. PW-11 has further testified that on localexamination she found the hymen of the prosecutrix to be intact and there were no signs of anybleeding being found. The original MLC Ex.PW-6/D of the victim reads, "No mark of injury or lovebite on body. Hymen intact. No tear or bleeding." In her cross-examination, PW-11 deposed thataccording to the MLC, no sign of rape was found on the person of the victim. It is also of significancein this case, that the half pant of the appellant, underwear of the appellant and the prosecutrix, andthe vaginal smear slides of the prosecutrix were sent for chemical examination to the ForensicScience Laboratory (FSL). However, except the salwar of the prosecutrix, which had tested positivefor semen, the glass slides, the half pant and the underwear of the appellant as well as that of theSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/13prosecutrix, all were found negative for semen test. In the case of Yerumalla Latchaiah Vs. State ofMP reported at (2006) 9 SCC 713, the Apex Court allowed the appeal of the accused on the groundthat the evidence of the prosecutrix was belied by the medical evidence. In Yerumalla Latchaiah(supra) the age of the victim was 8 years at the time of the alleged incident. The victim wasexamined by the doctor, and who stated in her evidence that no injury was found on any part of thebody of the victim much less on her private parts. Hymen was found intact and the doctor had statedthat there was no sign of rape. In the medical report it was stated that vaginal smears were collectedand examined microscopically, but no sperm was detected. The Apex Court, finding the evidence ofthe victim unreliable, acquitted the appellant. In view of the observations of the Apex Court, andreading them in the light of the facts of the case before me, I find the medical evidence as well as theforensic evidence, completely negating the version of the prosecutrix.38. Penetration in a rape is a sine qua non for the establishment of the offence. Although it has beenheld that complete penetration with emission of semen and rupture of hymen is not necessary. Aslight penetration in vulva with or without violence is also sufficient to constitute the offence of rape.It would be useful to refer the relevant portions of para 7 of Aman Kumar Vs. State of Haryanareported at (2004) 4 SCC 379:"7. Penetration is the sine qua non for an offence of rape. In order to constitutepenetration, there must be evidence clear and cogent to prove that some part of thevirile member of the accused was within the labia of the pudendum of the woman, nomatter how little (see Joseph Lines, IC&K 893). It is well known in the medical worldthat the examination of smegma loses all importance after twenty-four hours of theperformance of the sexual intercourse. [See S.P. Kohli (Dr) v. High Court of Punjaband Haryana1.]"(1979) 1 SCC 212 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 25239. In the case of Premiya alias Prem Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan reported at (2009) 1 SCC (Cri)20 the conviction of the accused was altered from Section 376, IPC to Section 354, IPC. In thestatement of the victim, what was said, was that the accused had thrown her on the ground, put offhis paijama, lifted her ghagra and committed rape on her. In the medical examination it was foundthat that there was absence of injury on the private parts of the prosecutrix and the prosecutrix hadalso not specifically stated about the act of penetration, but had used the term that he committedrape on her. Thus it is seen that there are such instances wherein the victim has described the act ofthe accused as an act of rape upon her, however, a close reading of the evidence of the victimbrought light the fact that though she had not been raped. This also stems from the fact that many atime, people do not understand the meaning of rape, and an act of molestation is loosely andcasually described as an act of rape. It was held in Premiya alias Prem Prakash (supra) that onreading the evidence of the prosecutrix it was clear that the appellant had outraged her modesty buthad not raped her. In the case of Aman Kumar (supra) it was observed: "[s]ignificantly, the evidenceof the prosecutrix and the doctor does not specifically refer to penetration...." The purpose ofreferring to the case of Premiya alias Prem Prakash (supra) and Aman Kumar (supra) in the facts ofthis case is to highlight that where neither the evidence of the prosecutrix nor the doctor specificallySumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/14refer to penetration, a further doubt is created that rape has not been committed. Rather in the casebefore me, the doctor has categorically opined that no signs of rape were found on the person of theprosecutrix.40. In the case of Sadashiv Ramrao Hadbe v. State of Maharashtra reported at (2006) 10 SCC 92,the Apex Court found the version of the prosecutrix unsupported by medical evidence and thesurrounding circumstances belied the case set up by her. It would be useful to reproduce relevantparagraphs of the case."6. We have carefully considered the evidence in this case. On a careful scrutiny of theentire evidence in this case, we are of the view that the prosecution evidence has somany contradictions and the whole incident seems to be highly improbable. Theprosecutrix and her husband had been staying at a village about 30 km away from theclinic of the appellant. They came to the appellants clinic and the prosecutrix aftermeeting the doctor with her child, again wanted to meet the doctor. She was allegedlytaken to a room adjacent to the main room occupied by the doctor. This room wassmall in dimension and in the room there was a table which was having a height of 34inches and breadth of 20 inches. The prosecutrix was asked to lie down on the tableand, according to the prosecutrix, first the doctor meddled with her private parts andthereafter committed sexual intercourse. When the accused touched her private partsand inserted his fingers, she did not raise any objection, nor did she get up from thetable. The prosecutrix has no case that she raised any objection by shouting or triedto get up from the table so as to prevent the assault on her. It may be noticed that somany patients were waiting outside and they could not have been far-off from theroom wherein the prosecutrix was allegedly sexually assaulted by the appellant. Shetold that her mouth was closed by the appellant.7. The doctor, who examined the prosecutrix at about 3 p.m., did not find any injuryon her body. There was only swelling on the upper lip but the prosecutrix had no casethat this swelling on the upper lip was caused during the course of the incident. Therewere no injuries on her private parts and the doctor who had examined her wasunable to give any opinion about the sexual intercourse allegedly taken place. It isimportant to note that vaginal swab was collected by the doctor and it was sent forchemical examination. Exhibit 43 is the pathological report and it shows thatmicroscopic examination of the vaginal swab showed desquamated cervical cells andfew co-oxalate crystals and fluid but no spermatozoa was found. The swab of vaginawas taken on the same day and if any sexual intercourse had taken place in allprobabilities, the vaginal swab would have contained some spermatozoa. The absenceof these sperm casts a serious doubt on the prosecution version.9. ......... If the version given by the prosecutrix is unsupported by any medicalevidence or the whole surrounding circumstances are highly improbable and belie thecase set up by the prosecutrix, the court shall not act on the solitary evidence of theprosecutrix. The courts shall be extremely careful in accepting the sole testimony ofSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/15the prosecutrix when the entire case is improbable and unlikely to happen.10. In the present case there were so many persons in the clinic and it is highlyimprobable that the appellant would have made a sexual assault on the patient whocame for examination when large number of persons were present in the nearvicinity. It is also highly improbable that the prosecutrix could not make any noise orget out of the room without being assaulted by the doctor as she was an able-bodiedperson of 20 years of age with ordinary physique. The absence of injuries on the bodyimprobabilise the prosecution version.12. It is true that the petticoat and the underwear allegedly worn by the appellant hadsome semen but that by itself is not sufficient to treat that the appellant had sexualintercourse with the prosecutrix. That would only cause some suspicion on theconduct of the appellant but not sufficient to prove the case, as alleged by theprosecution.13. The Sessions Court as well as the High Court had not taken into consideration theabsence of spermatozoa in the vaginal swab of the prosecutrix. It may also be noticedin the FI statement. In this case the prosecutrix had not given the full description ofthe incident allegedly taken place but when she was examined in court she hadimproved her version."41. In the case of Sadashiv Ramrao Hadbe (supra), the prosecutrix, her husband and her small childhad come to the clinic of the doctor (appellant therein) and the allegation was made that the doctorhad raped her. The Sessions Court as well as the High Court had convicted the doctor. The ApexCourt however observed that the surrounding circumstances of the case were such that the soletestimony of the prosecutrix could not be relied upon. It was also observed that since many personswere present in the clinic, it was highly improbable that the appellant would have made a sexualassault on the patient, who had come to him for her examination. The Court was of the opinion thatit was highly improbable that the prosecutrix could not have made any noise or get out of the roomwithout being assaulted by the doctor. As per the medical evidence it was observed that there was noinjury on the body of the prosecutrix or her private parts. The doctor, who had examined theprosecutrix, was unable to give any opinion about any sexual intercourse. Finding that the case setup by the prosecutrix was improbable and unlikely to happen, and besides that there were noinjuries on her body, the Apex Court allowed the appeal.42. The facts of the case of Sadashiv Ramrao Hadbe (supra) are somewhat similar to the facts of thepresent case at hand. Herein, the prosecutrix was sleeping in-between her parents on the small roofof her house measuring 37 sq. ft., where not only her family members were sleeping but also othertenants of the building were sleeping. It is highly improbable that the appellant threatened her andyet nobody heard him. The conduct of the prosecutrix is also doubtful keeping in view the fact thatdespite there being number of persons who were sleeping by her side and the appellant wasunarmed, she did not raise any alarm. Rather as stated above, her version is unbelievable. There arecontradictions between her version and that of her father. Moreover, it is questionable that she wasSumit Gupta vs State on 20 March, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178012524/16raped in a room where the younger brother of the appellant was also sleeping. In the light of all this,it was imperative for the trial court to have looked for corroboration, in the form of medical andscientific evidence. As per the medical evidence given by PW- 11, the doctor, no sign of rape wasfound on the person of the victim. The hymen of the victim was intact, there was no sign of anyblood, and no marks or injuries were present over her body. In the scientific evidence no semen wasfound on the half-pant of the appellant or his underwear and no semen was found in the underwearof the victim as well. Semen was also not found in the vaginal smear slides sent for chemicalexamination. The only explanation possible for semen to have been found on the salwar of thevictim is that she could be sharing the same with her mother, a married lady. Moreover, according tothe Forensic Report, what has been stated is that the semen found on the salwar is of human nature,but that does not mean that the semen found was of the appellant. No semen sample of theappellant was collected to verify whether the semen on the salwar was of the appellant or not. It maybe noticed that conviction in a false rape case casts a stigma on the character and reputation of aninnocent man and causes suffering which is no less than suffering of a rape victim.43. For the reasons aforestated, I find no case having been made out against this appellant undersection 376/506, IPC. Accordingly, the judgment dated 22.12.2008 and order on sentence dated03.01.2009, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi, in Sessions Case no. 25/06, FIR No.244/04, Sections 376/506, IPC, P.S. Welcome, Delhi, are set aside.44. The appeal is allowed. The appellant, if in jail, be released forthwith, if not required in any othercase.G.S.
