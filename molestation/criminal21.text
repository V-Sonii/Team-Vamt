Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 – Ss. 5 (4) (a), 19, 25 & 28 – Central Administrative Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1987 – Rr. 4 & 6 – Composition of Tribunals and Benches thereof – Power of Chairman to transfer cases from one Bench to another – Place of filing applications – Procedure for filing applications – Exclusion of jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court under article 136 of the Constitution.The power of judicial review of an order transferring an Original Application pending before a Bench of the Tribunal to another Bench under Section 25 of the Act can be judicially reviewed only by a Division Bench of the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the Bench passing the same, falls.In the instant case, the High Court at Calcutta has usurped jurisdiction to entertain the Writ Petition challenging the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, New Delhi, even after taking note of the fact that the Principal Bench of the Tribunal does not lie within its territorial jurisdiction. In the circumstances, the impugned judgment and final order passed by the High Court at Calcutta is to be held as one passed without jurisdiction and hence, it is ab initio void. Accordingly, it is set aside.Hon’ble Mr. Justice C.T. Ravikumar pronounced the judgment of the Bench comprising Hon’ble Mr. Justice A.M. Khanwilkar and His Lordship.For Petitioner(s) Mr. Tushar Mehta, SG Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, AOR For Respondent(s) Mr. Kunal Vajani, Adv. Mr. Debanjan Mandal, Adv. Mr. Sandip Dasgupta, Adv.
