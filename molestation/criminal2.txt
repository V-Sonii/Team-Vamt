Khulbe, J.Hon'ble Ramesh Ranganathan, C.J.Is the sole testimony, of the victim of sexual abuse, sufficient to hold the perpetrator guilty ofmisconduct in a departmental enquiry? Is the punishment of dismissal from service, imposed on theperpetrator as a consequence thereof, grossly disproportionate warranting interference by this Courtin the exercise of its power of judicial review? These questions, among several others, arise forconsideration in this writ petition.2. The extra-ordinary jurisdiction of this Court, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, hasbeen invoked by the petitioner seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the order of punishment ofBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/2dismissal dated 10.05.2012, the appellate order, the order directing initiation of a de-novo enquiry,and the fresh charge sheet, declaring the same as illegal, de hors the rules and unconstitutional; toissue a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to treat the petitioner as continuing inservice, and reinstate him with all consequential benefits including promotion, upgradation of pay,revised pay scales and arrears of salary, as he would have been entitled to, if the impugned ordershad not been passed; for a writ of mandamus to consider the petitioner's claim for payment ofdamages on account of the tortuous act of the respondents; and to quantify the damages to berecovered from the erring officers, and persons who were instrumental and responsible for thesame.3. Facts, to the limited extent necessary, are that, for the para- medic course (the duration of whichwas for a period of three months), the petitioner was nominated, for the three day period 16.08.1998to 18.08.1998, as a guest instructor for an outdoor exercise with trainees, for conducting a half daytheory class, a half night march exercise at the S.S.B. Academy Gwaldum, and to impart themtraining on military topics such as night navigation and map reading. On 18.08.1998 the trainees,including two lady members of the 94 medic course, were imparted training on theoretical subjects.The half night training exercise included a night march. However, because of heavy rains in thatarea, it was decided by the petitioner's superior officers not to permit both the lady trainees tomarch in the wet and muddy hilly areas to prevent any casualty occurring thereby. In the affidavit,filed in support of the writ petition, the petitioner states that it was decided to give minimum orgrace marks for the night march training to the two lady trainees as they did not participate in thenight march.4. After completion of the night training exercise, the petitioner, along with several other membersincluding the two lady trainees, sat in the cabin of a truck which was coming back to Gwaldumstation. It is in the cabin of the truck that the petitioner is said to have molested one of the ladytrainees, and to have sexually harassed her.5. While this unsavory incident is said to have taken place in the cabin of the truck at around 11 p.m.on 18.08.1998, the victim trainee (hereinafter referred to as the "complainant") lodged a complainton 19.08.1998 to the DIG F.A Gwaldum alleging sexual harassment by the petitioner during thereturn journey on 18.08.1998. Thereafter the petitioner was informed, by memorandum dated08.10.1999, that it was proposed to take action against him under Rule 16 of the CCS (CCA) Rules,1965 (for short the "1965 Rules"). A statement of imputations of misconduct/misbehavior, on whichaction was proposed to be taken, was issued giving the petitioner an opportunity to submit hisrepresentation thereto. Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules prescribes the procedure for imposing the minorpenalties as specified under Rule 11. The inquiry committee, constituted thereafter, submitted itsreport on 21.09.2001 holding the petitioner guilty of the charges. The disciplinary authority agreedwith the findings of the Inquiry Committee. Though minor penalty proceedings, under Rule 16 ofthe 1965 Rules, had been initiated against him by memorandum dated 08.10.1999, the petitioner, onbeing held guilty of the charges, was imposed, by proceedings dated 12.09.2003, the major penaltyof dismissal from service.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/36. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal,Allahabad bench (the "Tribunal" for short). In its order, in O.A. No.1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005,the Tribunal opined that the scope of judicial review was limited to ascertaining whether thedisciplinary proceedings were vitiated on account of procedural illegality causing prejudice to thedelinquent official, or if it was a case of no evidence and perverse finding applying the test of areasonable and prudent common man and, lastly, on the proportionality of punishment i.e. whetherthe punishment imposed was shockingly disproportionate to the misconduct held proved, that too inexceptional and rare cases for cogent reasons. The Tribunal, thereafter, opined that it was clear thatthe inquiry proceedings had commenced with the statement of the charged officer which was againstRule 14 (16) of the 1965 Rules; and conversion of a minor penalty charge-sheet into a major penaltycharge-sheet, without cancelling the earlier one and without giving the delinquent employee anothercharge-sheet under Rule 14, appeared to be prima-facie wrong and illegal. In view of these facts andcircumstances, the impugned order was quashed with liberty reserved to the respondents to initiatefresh disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the Rules, and the law on the subject.7. Instead of issuing a fresh charge-sheet under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules, which relates to majorpenalty proceedings, the respondents again constituted a four member committee to hold anenquiry pursuant to the very same charge-sheet dated 08.10.1999. The said inquiry committee, in itsreport dated 12.06.2008, held that both charges 1 and 2 were not proved. The disciplinary authority,however, disagreed with the findings and conclusions of this inquiry committee; and, by order dated04.11.2009, gave the petitioner an opportunity of making a representation, on the disagreement ofthe disciplinary authority with the findings of the central complaint committee, within 15 days. Acopy of the Inquiry Report, and the disagreement note, were enclosed along with the proceedingsdated 04.11.2009. The petitioner submitted his reply to the notice dated 04.11.2009 and, thereafter,the advice of the Union Public Service Commission (for short the "UPSC") was sought, byproceedings dated 06.07.2010, to the punishment proposed to be imposed.8. By its letter dated 12.08.2010, the UPSC informed that, on a perusal of the case report, it wasobserved that the Central Administrative Tribunal had, by its order dated 18.03.2005, quashed theorder dated 12.09.2003, and had directed the disciplinary authority to initiate fresh disciplinaryproceedings in accordance with the rules, and the law on the subject; the directions of the Tribunalhad not been complied with; the central complaints committee had conducted an inquiry as per theprevious charge-sheet; and the order of the Tribunal was required to be complied with, disciplinaryproceedings were required to be initiated under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules by issuing a freshcharge-sheet, and thereafter the matter should have been forwarded to the UPSC for its advice. TheUPSC, while returning the case records, requested that necessary action be taken in this regard.9. Thereafter, by proceedings dated 04.11.2011, the earlier charge sheet issued to the petitioner on08.10.1999 was cancelled, and the petitioner was informed that a fresh charge sheet was beingissued separately. By another proceedings No.10/23/DE/93/SSB/Pers.I/31 dated 04.11.2011, a freshcharge sheet was issued informing the petitioner that it was proposed to hold an inquiry against himunder Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules. Two articles of charges were framed, and the statement ofimputations of misconduct was annexed thereto.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/410. A four member central complaints committee was constituted before whom the petitionersubmitted his written statement of defence in reply to the charge sheet. The central complaintscommittee, in its report, held the petitioner guilty of both charges 1 and 2. On a copy of the inquiryreport being furnished to him, the petitioner submitted his representation there-against by his letterdated 27.06.2011. On its advice being sought, the UPSC, in its proceedings dated 30.03.2012, opinedthat the charges held established against the charged officer constituted grave misconduct on hispart; and they considered that ends of justice would be met if the penalty of dismissal from servicewas imposed on him.11. The petitioner was thereafter informed, by order dated 10.05.2012, that, on a carefulconsideration of the record of the inquiry and the advice of the UPSC, the President of India hadconcluded that ends of justice would be met if the penalty of dismissal from service was imposed onhim. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner preferred a statutory appeal on 20.07.2012. By proceedingsdated 30.01.2013, the petitioner was informed that his appeal against the penalty of dismissal fromservice, addressed to the President of India, was taken up by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and theMinistry had considered and rejected the said appeal as devoid of merits.12. Elaborate submissions have been put forth by Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for thepetitioner, and Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel for the Union of India. It is convenientto examine the rival contentions under different heads.I.    WERE THE FINDINGS RECORDED BY THE INQUIRY      COMMITTEE PERVERSE?13. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned Counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the charges in the freshcharge sheet were identical to those referred to in the earlier charge sheet; the findings of thecommittee of inquiry, holding the petitioner guilty of the charges, were perverse; the respondentswere hell-bent on holding the petitioner guilty thereof; the findings of the second de-novo inquirycommittee was based on surmises and conjectures; and there was no evidence on record to hold thecharges to have been proved.14. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Union of India,would submit that the inquiry committee, constituted after a fresh charge sheet was issued, held thepetitioner guilty of both the charges; the findings recorded in this inquiry report were affirmed bythe disciplinary authority who recommended imposition of the major penalty, of dismissal fromservice, on the petitioner; and the appointing authority had also agreed with the findings of theinquiry officer, and had imposed on him the punishment of dismissal from service.15. It is settled law that, where there is some relevant material which the authority has accepted andwhich may reasonably support the conclusion that the officer is guilty of the charges, it is not thefunction of the High Court, exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226, to review the material andto arrive at an independent finding thereupon. The High Court is not constituted, in a proceedingunder Article 226 of the Constitution, as a Court of appeal over the decision of the authoritiesholding a departmental enquiry against a public servant. It is concerned with whether the enquiry isBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/5held by an authority competent in that behalf, according to the procedure prescribed in that behalf,and whether the rules of natural justice have been followed. Where there is some evidence, whichthe authority entrusted with the duty to hold the enquiry has accepted and which evidence mayreasonably support the conclusion that the delinquent officer is guilty of the charge, it is not thefunction of the High Court, in a petition for a writ under Article 226, to review the evidence and toarrive at an independent finding. (State of Andhra Pradesh vs. S. Sree Rama Rao1).16. Whether or not the evidence, on which the domestic tribunal had relied upon, was satisfactoryand sufficient to justify its conclusion would not fall to be considered in a writ petition. (The State ofOrissa and another v. Murlidhar Jena2). A finding cannot be characterised as perverse orunsupported by any relevant material if it is a reasonable inference from proved facts. (Union ofIndia v. Sardar Bahadur3). Where there is some evidence which the disciplinary or the appellateauthority have accepted, and which evidence may reasonably support the conclusion that the officerwas guilty of improper conduct, it is not the function of the High Court, in proceedings under Article226, to review the evidence and to arrive at its own independent finding on the evidence. The HighCourt may interfere where the statutory authority has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction orwhere it has committed an error of law apparent on the face of the record. (Somnath Sahu v. TheState of Orissa and Ors4).17. The High Court may also interfere where the departmental authorities have held the proceedingsagainst the delinquent in a manner inconsistent with the rules of natural justice, or in violation ofthe statutory rules prescribing the mode of enquiry, or where the authorities have disabledthemselves from reaching a fair decision by some consideration extraneous to the evidence and themerits of the case, or by allowing themselves to be influenced by irrelevant considerations or wherethe conclusion, on the very face of it, is so wholly arbitrary and capricious that no reasonable personcould ever have arrived at that conclusion, or on similar grounds. But the departmental authoritiesare, if the enquiry is otherwise properly held, the sole judges of facts and if there be some legalevidence on which their findings can be based, the adequacy or reliability of that evidence is not amatter which can be permitted to be canvassed before the High Court in proceedings for a writunder Article 226 of the Constitution. (S. Sree Rama Rao1; The State of Madras v. G. Sundaram5).18. Although the Court cannot sit in appeal over the findings recorded by the Disciplinary Authorityor the Enquiry Officer in a departmental enquiry, it does not mean that in no circumstance can theCourt interfere. The power of judicial review, available to a High Court under the Constitution, takesin its stride the domestic enquiry as well, and the Courts can interfere with the conclusions reachedtherein if there is no evidence to support the findings or the findings recorded were such as couldnot have been reached by an ordinary prudent man or the findings were perverse. (Kuldeep Singh v.The Commissioner of Police and Ors.6; Nand Kishore v. State of Bihar7; Sree Rama Rao1; CentralBank of India v. Prakash Chand Jain8; Bharat Iron Works v. Bhagubhai Balubhai Patel and Ors.9;Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Administration through Secretary (Labour) and Ors.10; andYoginath D. Bagde v. State of Maharashtra and others11).19. The proceedings held against a public servant under the statutory rules, to determine whether heis guilty of the charge framed against him, are in the nature of quasi-judicial proceedings; and a writBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/6of certiorari can be claimed by a public servant if he is able to satisfy the High Court that theultimate conclusion of the authority in the said proceedings, which is the basis of his dismissal, isbased on no evidence. (Union of India v. H.C. Goel12). If the findings are perverse and are notsupported by the evidence on record or the findings recorded at the domestic trial are such to whichno reasonable person would have reached, it would be open to the High Court to interfere in thematter. (Yoginath D. Bagde11). A conclusion, based on no evidence whatever, is a conclusion whichis perverse and, therefore, suffers from an obvious and patent error on the face of the record. (H.C.Goel12). The High Court under Article 226 has jurisdiction to enquire whether or not the conclusionof the authority, on which the impugned order of dismissal rests, is supported by any evidence at all.(H.C. Goel12).20. The jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari is supervisory, and the Court exercising it is notentitled to act as an appellate Court. This limitation necessarily means that findings of fact reachedby the inferior Court or Tribunal, as a result of appreciation of evidence, cannot be reopened orquestioned in writ proceedings. An error of law which is apparent on the face of the record can becorrected by a writ, but not an error of fact, however grave it may appear to be. In regard to a findingof fact recorded by the Tribunal, a writ of certiorari can be issued if it is shown that, in recording thesaid finding, the Tribunal had erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence, orhad erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which had influenced the impugned finding.Similarly, if a finding of fact is based on no evidence, that would be regarded as an error of lawwhich can be corrected by a writ of certiorari. (Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan and others13; G.Sundaram5). Whether or not the evidence, on which the Tribunal relied, was satisfactory andsufficient for justifying its conclusion would not fall to be considered in a writ petition. (MurlidharJena2; and G. Sundaram5).21. The High Court is not competent to consider the question whether the evidence before theTribunal is insufficient or unreliable to establish the charge. It can only consider whether there wasany evidence at all which, if believed by the Tribunal, would establish the charge. Adequacy orsufficiency of the evidence to sustain the charge is not a question before the High Court whenexercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. (State of U.P. and others v. NandKishore Shukla and another14; and H. C. Goel12; Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmed Ishaque15;Nagendra Nath Bora v. The Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam16; Kaushalya Deviv. Bachittar Singh & others17; and Syed Yakoob13).22. Bearing these principles in mind, let us examine whether or not the findings of the inquirycommittee are based on no evidence or are perverse. To do so, it is necessary for us to refer, in brief,to the contents of the inquiry report. A charge-sheet was issued to the petitioner on 04.01.2011containing two articles of charge. Article-I was that, on 18.08.1998 at about 2330 hrs, the chargedofficer-an Assistant Commandant, during his posting as an Instructor F.A, Gwaldam, had outragedthe modesty of the complainant while travelling, in truck No.URB-5255 of F.A. Gwaldam, after nightnavigation exercise of medics initial course. Article-II was that the charged officer, after havingcommitted the aforesaid act of molestation of the complainant, had tried to put pressure on her onseveral occasions directly and indirectly to withdraw the complaint, and not pursue the matterfurther; and he had also sought to influence her through his father, who was the DIG, SSB, toBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/7withdraw her complaint against him.23. In its inquiry report dated 06.05.2011, the Central Complaints Committee (for short "theCommittee"), which had conducted the enquiry, observed that, except the part of outraging themodesty of the complainant, the other activities of the outdoor exercise, as referred to in Article-I,were admitted ie (i) participation of the complainant, the prosecution witnesses and the chargedofficer in the said night navigation exercise on 18.08.98;(ii) sharing the same back-seat in the cabin (behind the driver's seat) of truck No.URB-5255 of FAGwaldam by the charged officer, Ms. M. Etta, the complainant, Mr. R.C. Kabadwal, SFA (M) and Mr.B.C. Mathpal, AFO (M), with Dr. Pradeep Joshi, SMO having occupied the front seat; (iii) theirreturning back to FA, Gwaldam from Dangoli area after completion of the night navigation exerciseat around 2300 hrs; (iv) exchange of seats between Ms. M. Ette and the complainant; and (v)lodging of the complaint dated 19.08.1998 by the complainant.24. With respect to Article-II, the Central Complaints Committee opined that, except the partrelating to the alleged use of pressure on the complainant to withdraw the complaint, all otherevents, ie of the charged officer visiting the complainant's residence on 20.08.1998 at 0530 hrs, andat the temple gate of the Academy on 22.08.1998 at about 1830 hrs, and of his father meeting thecomplainant on 31.08.1998 were not disputed; and that the charged officer had met Dr. K.K. Pal inthe latter's residence, at least for one time was also not in dispute except for the request to save himfrom the complaint lodged by the complainant.25. The committee observed that there was no dispute that the complainant had, herself, writtenand lodged the complaint dated 19.08.1998; this had already been corroborated in the statements ofthe prosecution witnesses ie Dr. K.K. Pal, Smt. M. Ette and Mr. R.C. Kabadwal; in her complaintdated 19.08.98, the complainant had stated that the charged officer had touched his hands on herwaist and the lower side; the other details, like the charged officer rotating his hands on hershoulder and putting his hands inside her salwar, then pressing her breast and kissing her, had beenstated by the complainant in her statement dated 30.03.2011; along with others, the complainanthad attended the night navigation/map reading exercise on 18.08.98 from 2230 hrs to 2330 hrs;both the lady trainees, who participated in the map reading exercise on 18.08.98, were called backwhen they started marching; Mr. R.C. Kabadwal had corroborated that the two lady trainees werewithdrawn because of heavy rain, and as the nalas were overflowing; both Dr. P. Joshi and Mr. R.C.Kabadwal had also deposed that the complainant was not reluctant to participate in the marchingexercise; the charged officer and the complainant, along with others, had travelled together in thetruck from the debriefing point ie Dangoli Saddle to FA Gwaldam between 2300 hrs to 2400 hrs on18.08.98; six people, including the two lady trainees and the charged officer, were sitting on thebench (back side seat of the driver) in the cabin; they were sitting in the following order, during thereturn journey, from the door to the window side (initially) ie Mr. Mahesh-PW, Mr. Mathpal- PW,Mr. Kabadwal- PW, the charged officer, Ms. M. Ette- PW, and the complainant; during the journey,the two lady trainees replaced their seats with each other; Mr. G.D. Joshi (driver of the truck) hadstated that he had informed Dr. Pradeep Joshi of the breakage of the main patta of the bus and,accordingly, they were shifted to the truck; both the two lady trainees had taken their seats in theBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/8bus during the return journey, but were called to board the truck as the bus had broken down; thereturn journey started at around 2300 hrs; it was a dark night, and the light inside the truck hadalso been switched off; it was dark inside, and the visibility in the truck was poor; the terrain washilly with broken roads; the truck underwent jerks and bumps as the road was uphill with numerousbends; and, besides the huge noise of the engine of the truck, there was heavy rain outside with darkand foggy weather.26. The Committee further observed that, in her deposition, the complainant had stated that she satbesides the driver, after her Ms. Ette was sitting, and after Ms. Ette the charged officer was sitting;the charged officer had asked her to change places with Ms. Ette, but she did not get up; after that hehas started putting his hand on her shoulder across her back, and had reached inside her salwar; itwas so irritating that she got up from her place; the charged officer pulled her hands and made hersit beside him; and after that he did all those things which she had written in her complaint. Incross- examination, the complainant confirmed that she stood up from her seat and the chargedofficer pulled her hand and made her sit next to him. The committee recorded the corroborativestatement of Ms. M. Ette who stated that the complainant had put her head on Ms. M. Ette'sshoulder; she was shaking; after that Ms. Ette moved forward as she found some movement behindher; the complainant stood up; Ms. Ette moved to the window and looked out, and the complainantsat next to the charged officer. In his statement Dr. Pradeep Joshi (PW1) deposed that he saw thecomplainant in a disturbed mood at Kandhar stop and she was weeping; on not getting any replyregarding the reasons for her being disturbed, he told her 'I will talk to you tomorrow'; and hethought that the reason might be that she had not participated in the said night navigation exercise.27. The Committee opined that, though both the lady trainees were willing to participate in the nightmarch exercise, they were called back for their safety due to inclement weather ie heavy rain,overflowing of nalas etc; consequently, the question of their losing marks did not arise; thedeposition of both Ms. Ette and Dr. Joshi was that the complainant was weeping; on reachingGwaldam, the complainant had informed him of what had happened with her, and Dr. Joshi hadtold her 'don't worry', we will talk next morning'; the complainant had deposed that, 'as a traineeand a new recruit of SSB, she was shocked at what the charged officer, who was their instructor(meant for their safety and security), was doing, and she had reacted the way she did; when theincident was taking place, she first tried to protect herself resisting the charged officer; she had evenrequested him not to do this, but he did not stop; the stand of the charged officer, that the two ladytrainees were taking revenge by maligning his reputation as he was a very tough and strictinstructor, was unfounded; none of the prosecution witnesses had stated that the charged officerhad scolded the trainees on any occasion; the view of the charged officer that he was targeted due toother extraneous factors was not corroborated by any of the witnesses; since the lady trainees werewithdrawn from the night march due to inclement weather, they could not have any fear of theirlosing marks; the complainant had also stated that she did not know the charged officer beforecoming to Gwaldam for training, and had no contact with him beyond the class room; from thestatement of Ms. Ette, it was clear that the complainant had put her head on Ms. Ette's shoulder andhad started crying, and was shaking; Ms. Ette heard the noise 'please....please'; and Ms. Ette hadalso stated that she was worried that what had happened to the complainant may happen to her and,in view of her safety, she had turned her face to the other side.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/928. The committee opined that this was a natural reaction from any person who apprehends dangeror feels helplessness; the complainant had stated that, 5-10 minutes later, Dr. Joshi had stopped thetruck at Kandhar, and had asked everyone to get down from the truck; when everyone reboarded,Dr. Joshi sat next to the complainant; on seeing her disturbed and crying, Dr. Joshi told her that hewould talk to her in the morning; there was no evidence that the complainant had developed anypersonal liking or soft corner for the charged officer; she had denied this fact, and had stated thatshe came to know that the charged officer was her Instructor when he came to take their classes atFA Gwaldam, and she did not even know his name; the intention of the charged officer wasostensibly manifested by his behaviour; despite reprimands from the complainant, he continued toact against moral sanctions; the charged officer had demonstrated unwelcome sexual advances, bothdirectly and by implication; the statement of the complainant showed that the charged officer hadput his hand on her shoulder, had pressed her breast and had kissed her; it was evident that thecharged officer had harassed and pestered her; he had subjected the complainant to a conduct whichwas against moral sanctions, which did not stand the test of decency and modesty, and whichprojected unwelcome sexual advances; such action on the part of the charged officer was squarelycovered by the term 'sexual harassment'; the material on record clearly established an unwelcomesexually determined behaviour on the part of the charged officer against the complainant; and thiswas also an act to outrage her modesty.29. The committee held that the facts of the case showed that the complainant was a subordinateemployee, while the charged officer was her Instructor taking classes; he was a superior officer atthe training centre; by rank also, the relationship was that of a junior and a senior in theorganization; the charged officer sat close to the complainant with ulterior motives and, takingadvantage of his position, had outraged her modesty, which did not stand the test of decency; thisactivity continued despite her protest/resistance asking him not to do this; he continued hisunwelcome sexual activities telling her why don't you like this, as recorded in the statement of thecomplainant; the affidavit on record clearly showed that the charged officer had caused sexualharassment by taking advantage of his superior position; the complainant had reasonable groundsto apprehend that her decision would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or workor promotion or qualifying the professional course/training; it created a hostile work environment;and adverse consequences might be visited upon her had the victim not consented to the conduct inquestion, or if she raised any objection thereto. The Committee concluded that the act of the chargedofficer was unbecoming of good conduct and behaviour expected from a superior officer, andundoubtedly amounted to sexual harassment of the complainant.30. The Committee, thereafter, opined that the evidence on record disclosed that the complainantwas twenty years old when she joined the SSB on 02.07.1998; after one month she was sent to FAGwaldam to undergo Medics Initial Course-94th Batch from 10th August, 1998; the incident ofsexual molestation occurred in the night of 18.08.1998; in her statement dated 30.03.2011, thecomplainant stated that there were 58 trainees of whom two were women; the charged officer did allthose things which she had written in her complaint; after he kissed her and fondled her breast, shewas continuously telling him not to do so; she told him "do not do this"; she was requesting him andpushing him with her hands; he held her hands and continued to tell "why don't you like this?"; shethereafter put her head on Ms. Ette's shoulder, and started crying; she complained to Dr. PradeepBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/10Joshi after she got down from the truck, and told him what happened to her; after coming to herroom, she wrote a complaint and took it to Dr. K.K. Pal and Dr. Pradeep Joshi; and, as Dr. K.K. Palwas not present, Dr. Pradeep Joshi informed her that he would give the complaint to Dr. K.K. Palwho was the Senior Instructor.31. The Committee refused to buy the petitioner's claim, that the complainant was disturbed becauseof her not participation in the night navigation exercise, holding that the evidence on recorddisclosed that both the girl trainees were called back due to inclement weather i.e. heavy rain,overflowing of Nallas etc, and for their safety; as such the question of their losing any marks did notarise; the statement of Smt. Ette and Dr. Joshi showed that the complainant was weeping; and thiscould only be because of misbehavior, and her molestation by the charged officer; the complainanthad reacted immediately, and had resisted the advances of the charged officer requesting him not todo so, but he did not stop; the charged officer's contention that his reputation was maligned as hewas a tough Instructor did not merit acceptance, as none of the witnesses had stated that thecharged officer had scolded the trainees on any previous occasion; the complainant did not know thecharged officer before coming to Gwaldam for training; and there was no contact between thembeyond the class-room.32. The Committee expressed its disbelief of the charged officer's statement that, because of thebumpy roads and jerks, he may have touched the complainant, but it was circumstantial and notintentional. The Committee opined that, while his body may have touched the complainant becauseof the jerks of the vehicle, his hands reaching out to her, and gradually coming down to her breast,was not on this account; the charged officer's hands had reached out to her breasts for pressing, andhe had kissed her; despite her resistance, he continued to rotate his hands over her body and breast;he had pulled her hands to make her sit close to him; all these were not due to the congested sittingand the bumpy roads; he was taking advantage of the circumstances of the darkness in the cabin; itwas a clear case of unwelcome sexual advances on the part of the charged officer, and amounted tosexual harassment; and the charged officer, being a superior officer, did that taking advantage of hisposition vis-à-vis the complainant.33. With respect to Charge No. 2, of putting pressure directly or indirectly on the complainant towithdraw the complaint dated 19.08.1998, the Committee noted the deposition of the complainant,Ms. Ette and Dr. K.K. Pal that the charged officer and his father had put pressure directly andindirectly on the complainant to withdraw the complaint; the charged officer had approached thecomplainant thrice at 05:30 AM on 20.08.1998 at the Female Quarters, at 1600 hrs on 22.08.1998at the Medics Course Office, and again at 1830 hrs on 22.08.1998 at the Temple /Officers MessGate; his father had met the complainant on 30.08.1998 when Dr. Pradeep Joshi had called for thecomplainant; the charged officer's father had also met Dr. K.K. Pal at his residence at 2330 hrs on19.08.1998, at 0600 hrs on 21.08.1998, and again at 0630 hrs on 25.08.1998; the complainant hadclarified that the purpose of the visit was for her to withdraw her complaint; the charged officer'sfather was a Deputy Inspector General in the SSB, and his colleague officers in the training centrewere Dr. K.K. Pal and Dr. Pradeep Joshi; the immediate beneficiary, of the complaint beingwithdrawn, was the charged officer as the allegations made against him would have been negatedand his social position would have been restored; it was clear that both the charged officer and hisBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/11father had met the complainant requesting her to withdraw the complaint; Dr. K.K. Pal had alsostated that the charged-officer had approached him to save him from the allegations of sexualharassment; Dr. K.K. Pal was the Senior Instructor of the Medics Wing, FA, Gwaldam and In-chargeof the 94th Medics (Initial) Course; Dr. Pal had further stated that the charged officer's father hadalso approached him exerting pressure on him to request the complainant to withdraw the case; Dr.K.K. Pal had advised the charged officer's father not to interfere in the case, and not to talk toanybody including the complainant; and, later on, he was informed that the charged officer's fatherhad approached the complainant exerting pressure on her to withdraw the complaint. TheCommittee concluded holding that the overwhelming evidence on record established both charges 1and 2.34. It is true that the charges leveled in the fresh charge-sheet were similar to those referred to inthe earlier charge-sheet. This was because both of them related to the very same incidents and had,necessarily, to be more or less identical. That, by itself, would not vitiate the subsequent inquiry heldon a fresh charge-sheet being issued on 04.01.2011, since the need to issue a fresh charge-sheet wasnecessitated by the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated18.03.2005, holding that, since the earlier charge-sheet was issued under Rule 16 of the 1965 Ruleswhich related to minor penalty proceedings, a major penalty could not be imposed in terms thereof;and, in case a major penalty is to be imposed, then a fresh charge-sheet is required to be issuedunder Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules. It is in such circumstances that a fresh charge-sheet came to beissued, under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules, to comply with the directions of the Central AdministrativeTribunal.35. As noted hereinabove, the High Court, in the exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction under Article226 of the Constitution, would neither sit in appeal, nor substitute its views for that of the domestictribunal. It would also not undertake an examination of the adequacy or sufficiency of the evidenceon record. It would interfere only if the findings of fact recorded by the Tribunal is based on noevidence or if the findings are perverse. "No evidence" does not mean "total dearth of evidence". Afinding recorded in a departmental inquiry can be said to be perverse, or based on no evidence, ifthe findings, on which the Inquiry Committee had found the delinquent officer guilty of the charges,are based on evidence which no reasonable man would have considered sufficient or reasonable toestablish a finding of guilt. As shall be elaborated later in this order, even circumstantial evidence orhearsay evidence is permissible in departmental inquiries.36. The Inquiry Committee found no reason to disbelieve the statement of the complainant that thepetitioner had reached out to her, had put his hand inside her salwar, had pressed her breasts andhad kissed her; and, despite her resistance, he continued to rotate his hands over her body andbreasts and had pulled her hands to make her sit close to him. This statement of the complainant,coupled with the evidence of Smt. Ette that the complainant was weeping, she used the words"please please" and, after putting her head on the shoulder of Smt. Ette, had started crying, and acomplaint being lodged by the complainant, regarding this incident, by the very next morning,constitute sufficient evidence to establish the petitioner's guilt. Even with respect to Charge No.-II,the Inquiry Committee noted that the delinquent officer had approached the complainant thrice at05:30 hrs on 20.08.1998, at 16:00 hrs on 22.08.1998, and again at 18:30 hrs on 22.08.1998, atBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/12three different places; and his father, who was a Deputy Inspector General in the Sashastra SeemaBal (ie the very same organization where both the petitioner and the complainant were employed),had also met the complainant at the residence of Dr. K.K. Pal at 23:30 hrs on 19.08.1998, and againat 16:00 hrs on 28.08.1998. These undisputed facts, coupled with the evidence of Dr. K.K. Pal, thatthe charged officer's father had also approached him and had exerted pressure on him to request thecomplainant to withdraw the case, was sufficient, in a departmental inquiry, to hold both thecharges to have been established.37. Even in cases where there are two possible views which can be taken on the evidence on record,the High Court would not interfere, in certiorari proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution,as long as the view taken by the Inquiry Committee is a possible view, and though the other viewcanvassed before it, on behalf of the delinquent officer, appeals to it more. It is only if the findingsrecorded, and the conclusions arrived at, by the Inquiry Committee are of such a nature, which noreasonable man could have arrived at, would the High Court then intervene. We are satisfied thatthe present case is not one such. The petitioner's contention that the findings recorded by theInquiry Committee are perverse does not, therefore, merit acceptance.II. IS THE SOLE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THECHARGES?38. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the petitioner was heldguilty on the self-serving sole testimony of the complainant; no other witness had corroborated thecomplainant's testimony; and the complainant's self-serving evidence cannot form the basis forholding the petitioner guilty of the charges.39. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel for the Union of India, wouldsubmit that the degree of proof, required to establish guilt in a departmental inquiry, ispreponderance of probabilities, and not proof beyond reasonable doubt; and the sole testimony ofthe complainant, supported by the circumstantial evidence on record, sufficed to establish thecharges levelled against the petitioner.40. A woman, who is the victim of a sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victimof another man's lust. (Vijay v. State of M.P18; State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash KewalchandJain19). The Indian Evidence Act does not state that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it iscorroborated in material particulars. She is, undoubtedly, a competent witness under Section 118thereof. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in thecase of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the CriminalCourt, in a criminal proceeding, must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with theevidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the courtkeeps this in mind, and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is norule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act, similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114,which requires it to look for corroboration. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to thetestimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.But if a prosecutrix is an adult, and of full understanding, the Court is entitled to base a conviction,Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/13in a criminal proceeding, on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and nottrustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances, appearing on the record of the case, disclose thatthe prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Courtshould, ordinarily, have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. (Chandraprakash KewalchandJain19; Vijay18).41. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case. TheCriminal Court should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not be swayed by minorcontradictions, or insignificant discrepancies, in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of afatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If the evidence of the prosecutrixinspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement inmaterial particulars. (State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh & others20; Vijay18). There is no legalcompulsion to look for any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix beforerecording an order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction, in acriminal case, can be recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if her evidence inspiresconfidence and there is absence of circumstances which militate against her veracity. (GurmitSingh20; Vijay18; Wahid Khan v. State of M.P21; Rameshwar v. State of Rajasthan22). The CriminalCourt may convict the accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix. (Vijay18). In cases involvingsexual harassment, molestation, etc. the Criminal Court is duty-bound to deal with such cases withutmost sensitivity. Evidence of the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction, and it does notrequire any corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. TheCriminal Court may, however, look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicialconscience. (Gurmit Singh20; Vijay18).42. State Of Maharashtra and another v. Madhukar Narayan Mardikar23 was an appeal against thejudgment of the Bombay High Court which had observed that, since the lady was an unchastewoman, it was extremely unsafe to allow the fortune and career of a government official to be put injeopardy upon the uncorroborated version of such a woman who made no secret of her illicitintimacy with another person. In this context, the Supreme Court held that the lady was honestenough to admit the dark side of her life; even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy and noone can invade her privacy as and when he likes; it is also not open to any and every person toviolate her person as and when he wishes; she is entitled to protect her person if there is an attemptto violate it against her wish; and she is equally entitled to the protection of the law. In short, savewith her consent, no man is entitled to violate the person of any woman, whatever the circumstancesmay be.43. As the sole testimony of a prosecutrix, in a criminal case involving sexual harassment andmolestation, would suffice if it is otherwise reliable, there is no justifiable reason not to accept thesole testimony of a victim, of sexual harassment and molestation, in a departmental inquiry as theenquiry held by a domestic Tribunal is not, unlike a Criminal Court, governed by the strict andtechnical rules of the Evidence Act. (Murlidhar Jena2). A disciplinary proceeding is not a criminaltrial. The standard of proof required is that of preponderance of probabilities, and not proof beyondreasonable doubt. If the inference was one which a reasonable person would draw, from the provedfacts of the case, the High Court cannot sit as a court of appeal over a decision based on it. (SardarBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/14Bahadur3). If the enquiry has been properly held, the question of adequacy or reliability of theevidence cannot be canvassed before the High Court. The only question is whether the proved factsof the case would warrant such an inference. (Sardar Bahadur3; and S. Sree Rama Rao1). If thedisciplinary inquiry has been conducted fairly without bias or predilection, in accordance with therelevant disciplinary rules and the Constitutional provisions, the order passed by such authoritycannot be interfered with merely on the ground that it was based on evidence which would beinsufficient for conviction of the delinquent on the same charge at a criminal trial. (Nand KishorePrasad v. The State of Bihar and others24).44. Strict and sophisticated rules of evidence, under the Indian Evidence Act, are not applicable in adomestic enquiry. (State of Haryana vs. Rattan Singh25; J.D. Jain v. Management of State Bank ofIndia & others26). Sufficiency of evidence, in proof of the finding by a domestic tribunal, is beyondscrutiny. (Rattan Singh25). In a departmental enquiry, guilt need not be established beyondreasonable doubt. Proof of misconduct is sufficient. (J.D. Jain26). All material, which are logicallyprobative for a prudent mind, are permissible. There is no allergy even to hearsay evidence providedit has reasonable nexus and credibility. (Rattan Singh25).45. In the present case, the testimony of the complainant gives graphic and shocking details of actsof sexual molestation perpetrated by the petitioner on her. This evidence is also corroborated in partby the testimony of others. The Enquiry Committee has held that, before this incident, the petitionerand the complainant were not even personally acquainted with each other, and the petitioner'sclaim, of the complaint having been instituted for extraneous considerations, was not tenable. Insuch circumstances, we see no reason why the Enquiry Committee should be faulted for largelyrelying on the testimony of the complainant. The contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner,under this head, necessitate rejection.III. DID THE DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE STATUTORYPROVISIONS, AND DID HE FAIL TO ASSIGN REASONS, WHILE DISAGREEING WITH THEFINDINGS RECORDED IN THE EARLIER INQUIRY REPORT?46. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that, while disagreeing withthe findings of the inquiry committee in its report dated 12-06-2008, the disciplinary authority hadfailed to comply with the mandatory requirement of Rule 15(1-B) & 15(2) of the 1965 Rules; and hedid not assign reasons for such disagreement, and did not record his own findings on the charges.Learned Counsel would rely on Dhirendra Kumar Pannalal Dixit Vs. Visvesvaraya National Instituteof Technology, Nagpur27 in this regard.47. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel for the Union of India, wouldsubmit that, along with the show cause notice, a copy of the inquiry report and the disagreementnote were furnished to the petitioner; the contention that the disagreement note was prepared witha pre-determined mind, and without assigning reasons, is not tenable; and a perusal of thedisagreement note shows that reasons were assigned therein.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/1548. It is true that, whenever the disciplinary authority disagrees with the enquiry authority on anyarticle of charge, then, before it records its own findings on such charge, it must record its tentativereasons for such disagreement, and give the delinquent officer an opportunity to represent before itrecords its findings. The report of the enquiry committee, containing its findings, is required to beconveyed, and the delinquent officer is required to be given an opportunity to persuade thedisciplinary authority to accept the favourable conclusion of the enquiry officer. Principles of naturaljustice require the authority which has to take a final decision, and can impose a penalty, to give anopportunity to the officer charged of misconduct to file a representation before the disciplinaryauthority records its findings on the charges framed against the officer. (Punjab National Bank vs.Kunj Behari Misra28; S.P. Malhotra v. Punjab National Bank & others29; Yoginath D. Bagde11; SBIv. K.P. Narayanan Kutty30; J.A. Naiksatam v. Prothonotary and Senior Master, High Court ofBombay & others31; P.D. Agrawal v. SBI & others32; and Ranjit Singh v. Union of India33). Notfurnishing a copy of the recorded reasons, for disagreement from the enquiry report, can be said tocause prejudice to the delinquent. (S.P. Malhotra29).49. In Dhirendra Kumar Pannalal Dixit27, on which reliance is placed on behalf of the petitioner,the Bombay High Court held thus:-".......Needless to state that when the Inquiry Officer (IO) exonerates the chargedofficer/employee (CO) of all charges, normally such officer is not guilty. Thedisciplinary authority (DA) therefore exonerates him & drops the charges. However,if the findings of IO are not acceptable to it either in part or fully, in that event it getsright to disagree with such of the findings which it finds unsustainable. It has tofollow the procedure prescribed in service rules. The DA after getting the inquiryreport, has to evaluate it & if it accepts the report as it is, the officer cannot bepunished. But when it finds that some findings of the IO are bad, it has to record itstentative reasons for its disagreement & then serve a notice upon the CO calling uponhim to explain as to why the findings in report in his favour should not be accordinglymodified or reversed. In present matters the IO has totally exonerated the CO, it wasnot necessary for the DA to first have explanation of CO before proceeding to evaluatethe report. But in a hypothetical case, if the report finds CO guilty of few charges &not guilty of the remaining, the DA will have to follow the procedure stipulated by theHon. Apex Court in case of Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan: (1991) 1 SCC 588& ECIL v. B. Karunakar: (1993) 4 SCC 727. But in this case that contingency did notarise as the CO was acquitted of all the misconducts by the IO.But then the opportunity to be extended or its nature does not change & the DAcannot arrive at a final verdict on fact of guilt or otherwise without first extending tothe CO an opportunity to urge why & how a particular finding in his favour shouldnot be varied. The Rule 15(4) of CCA & CCS Rules employs the word "tentativereasons" with some purpose. The DA cannot conclude the findings on fact withoutextending such an opportunity to the CO or behind his back. If it does so, theprinciples of natural justice expounded in cases of Mohd. Ramzan Khan & B.Karunakar (supra) stand violated. It is therefore apparent that the prima facie view ofBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/16DA is expressed in these tentative reasons for its inability to agree with the findingsof the IO. These tentative reasons emanate from the report of the IO or the materialwhich has been proved on record of departmental inquiry. If the tentative reasons donot spring from the inquiry records, the so called reasons do not constitute legallysustainable grounds for issuing a show cause notice to the CO. If the show causenotice issued by the DA is found vitiated on any ground, then also the finding of IOcannot be discarded. If the explanation furnished by the CO is found satisfactory, thetentative reasons of the DA become unsustainable & the report of IO exonerating theCO must be given effect to. Hence, in cases where the IO exonerates the CO fully, theemployer or the DA have to establish availability of legally sustainable material toform a tentative reasons to disagree with the conclusions of IO & adherence to theprinciples of natural justice thereafter. It is these tentative reasons which thereaftergovern the further course of action & fate of disciplinary proceedings....." (emphasissupplied)50. Rule 15 of the 1965 Rules relates to action on the inquiry report. Rules 15(1)(b) and 15(2), whichare relied upon on behalf of the petitioner, were substituted by Rules 15(2) and (2-A) videNotification dated 21.08.2000, and were published in the Gazette of India. Rule 15(2), as amendedin the year 2000, requires the disciplinary authority to forward or cause to be forwarded a copy ofthe report of the inquiry, if any, held by it or, where the Disciplinary Authority is not the InquiringAuthority, a copy of the report of the Inquiring Authority together with its own tentative reasons fordisagreement, if any, with the findings of the Inquiring Authority on any article of charge, to thedelinquent Government servant who shall be required to submit, if he so desires, his writtenrepresentation or submission to the Disciplinary Authority within fifteen days, irrespective ofwhether or not the report is favourable to the Government servant. This requirement was, in fact,complied with by the Disciplinary Authority who, pursuant to the second inquiry, had, by hisproceedings dated 04.11.2009, furnished his disagreement note to the charged officer.51. The said disagreement note, after taking note of the conclusions of the inquiry committee,records that, as per the statement of Ms. Ette, she had felt movement of the fingers of the petitionerover the shoulders of the complainant; moving the fingers on the shoulders of a lady employeeamounted to physical contact and advances, which included unwelcome sexually determinedbehavior whether directly or otherwise; it had also been established that both the charged officer,and his father, had tried to influence the complainant, as approaching her to withdraw thecomplaint could not also be taken lightly; it had been established beyond doubt that the chargedofficer had also requested the complainant to withdraw the complaint, and the same had beenproved with respect to his father who was a senior officer of the organisation; the facts of the case,and the circumstantial evidence, did prove that some incident had occurred; and, therefore, thefindings of the Complaint Committee on both the charges were not acceptable to the DisciplinaryAuthority.52. Rule 15(2-A) of the 1965 Rules requires the Disciplinary Authority to consider therepresentation, if any, submitted by the Government servant and record his findings beforeproceeding further in the matter as specified in sub-rules (3) and(4). The petitioner submitted hisBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/17reply to the disagreement note asserting that the statement of the complainant was extremelydoubtful. He denied having committed the acts as alleged or to have directly or indirectly tried topressurize or influence the complainant to withdraw her complaint. It is, thereafter, that the matterwas referred to the Union Public Service Commission vide proceedings dated 06.07.2010. In replythereto the UPSC, in its proceedings dated 12.08.2010, pointed out, in our opinion rightly so, thatthe entire procedure, commencing from the appointment of the second inquiry committee, wasvitiated as it fell foul of the order of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005; it ispursuant thereto that the entire inquiry proceedings were dropped, the first charge sheet wascancelled, and a new charge sheet was issued on 04.01.2011; an inquiry was conducted with respectto the fresh charge-sheet; and the inquiry committee held the petitioner guilty of both the charges.53. The second inquiry, also conducted on the basis of the first charge sheet dated 08.10.1999, wasset at naught on the first charge sheet being cancelled by proceedings dated 04.11.2011. Thecontention that Rules 15(2) and 15(2-A) were violated is without any basis, since the eventualpunishment of dismissal from service, imposed on the petitioner by order dated 10.05.2012, was onthe basis of the fresh charge sheet dated 04.1.2011 issued after the second inquiry proceedings,wherein the inquiry committee had held the petitioner not guilty of both the charges were cancelled.54. The second inquiry, conducted by the Inquiry Committee constituted under proceedings dated12.06.2008, was not taken to its logical conclusion as no order of punishment was passed by thedisciplinary authority, and all further proceedings were, instead, dropped on the advice of the UPSC.As a fresh charge-sheet was issued on 04.11.2011, after cancelling the earlier charge-sheet dated08.10.1999, the second disciplinary proceedings, initiated pursuant to the first charge sheet, has norelevance, and deficiencies, if any, in such proceedings matter little, as the entire disciplinaryproceedings, initiated in terms of the charge-sheet dated 08.10.1999, came to an end on itscancellation on 04.11.2011.IV. IS THE DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY INVARIABLY REQUIRED TO ASSIGN REASONS FORPASSING AN ORDER OF PUNISHMENT ?55. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the DisciplinaryAuthority has not assigned valid reasons for holding the petitioner guilty of the charges; and, in theabsence of valid reasons being assigned, the order of the Disciplinary Authority necessitates beingset aside.56. In his order dated 10.05.2012, the President of India (the competent authority) referred to theentire history of the case, and noted that the Central Complaint Committee had, in its proceedingsdated 09.05.2011, held that both the charges stood proved; on a careful consideration of the reportof the Central Complaint Committee, and the other records of the case, the Disciplinary Authorityhad agreed with the findings of the Committee; a copy of the report of the Central ComplaintCommittee dated 08.06.2011 was furnished to the charged officer, by which he was given anopportunity to make his submissions; the representation of the charged officer dated 27.06.2011 wasconsidered by the Disciplinary Authority, and his contention was found devoid of merits, as thecircumstantial evidence of the prosecution witnesses, and the statement of the victim, proved bothBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/18the charges leveled against the charged officer; on the Disciplinary Authority referring the matter forits advice, the UPSC, after taking into account all aspects relevant to the case, had noted that thecharges established against the charged officer constituted grave misconduct on his part; and it hadadvised that ends of justice would be met if the penalty of dismissal from service was imposed on thecharged officer. On a careful consideration of the record of the inquiry, and the advice of the UPSC,the President concluded that ends of justice would be met if the penalty of "Dismissal from Service"was imposed on the petitioner. The order of the President was communicated to the petitioner bythe Deputy Inspector General of Police (Personnel).57. It is not the requirement of Article 311(2) that, in every case, the punishing authority should, inits order, assign reasons for coming to its conclusion. (Tara Chand Khatri v. Municipal Corporationof Delhi and others34; and State of Assam & others v. Bimal Kumar Pandit35). When a DisciplinaryAuthority agrees with the findings and conclusions of the Enquiring Authority, it is not necessary inlaw to give detailed reasons as to why he intends to agree with the findings of the enquiringauthority. [G.M. (Personnel Wing), Canara Bank & others vs. M. Raja Rao36]. In such a case, thequestion of non-compliance with principles of natural justice does not arise. (Ram Kumar v. State ofHaryana37). It cannot also be laid down, as a general rule, that an order is a non-speaking ordersimply because it is brief and not elaborate. Every case has to be judged in the light of its own factsand circumstances. (Tara Chand Khatri34; The Union of India and others v. K. Rajapa Menon38;State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur and others v. Prabhu Dayal Grover39; State of Madras v. A.R.Srinivasan40).58. Disciplinary proceedings, against a delinquent officer, begin with an enquiry conducted by anofficer appointed in that behalf. That enquiry is followed by a report and the Public ServiceCommission is consulted where necessary. Having regard to the material which is thus madeavailable to the Disciplinary authority, and which is made available to the delinquent officer also, itis unreasonable to suggest that the Disciplinary authority must record its reasons why it accepts thefindings of the Tribunal. Where the disciplinary authority agrees with the findings of the inquirytribunal which are against the delinquent officer, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that either heor the appointing authority cannot impose the penalty against the delinquent officer in accordancewith the findings of the inquiry tribunal unless it gives reasons to show why the said findings wereaccepted by it. The proceedings are no doubt quasi-judicial, but having regard to the manner inwhich these enquiries are conducted, no obligation can be imposed on the disciplinary authority/appointing authority to record reasons in every case. (Tara Chand Khatri34; A.R. Srinivasan40).Apart from any requirement imposed by the statute or a statutory rule, either expressly or bynecessary implication, there is no legal obligation that the disciplinary authority should give reasonsfor its decision. (Som Datt Datta v. Union of India & others41; Tara Chand Khatri34).59. While it may be necessary for a disciplinary or appointing authority, exercising quasi-judicialfunctions, to state the reasons in support of its order if it differs from the conclusions arrived at andthe recommendations made by the enquiring officer, in view of the scheme of a particular enactmentor the rules made thereunder, it would be laying down the proposition a little too broadly to say thateven an order of concurrence must be supported by reasons. (Tara Chand Khatri34).Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/1960. A bare reading of the impugned order would show that the entire history of the case as also tothe Inquiry Report of the Central Compliance Committee was referred to; and theAppointing/Disciplinary Authority had also recorded their concurrence with the findings of theInquiry Committee. Since the order of the Appointing/Disciplinary Authority is one of concurrence,the reasons assigned, and the findings recorded, by the Inquiry Committee, to hold that the chargeswere established, would suffice as the reasons for the Appointing/Disciplinary Authority to hold thepetitioner guilty of the charges leveled against him. It is wholly unnecessary for theAppointing/Disciplinary Authority to again repeat the very same findings in his order. Thecontention, urged on behalf of the petitioner, therefore necessitates rejection.V.    IS THE APPELLATE AUTHORITY'S ORDER VITIATED      FOR FAILURE TO ASSIGN REASONS?61. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would then submit that the appellateauthority had failed to take into consideration Rule 27(A) of the 1965 Rules; the petitioner's appealwas rejected by a non- speaking order without assigning reasons; and such an order could not besustained. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Unionof India, would submit that the appellate authority, while dismissing the appeal, need not assignelaborate reasons in case he affirms the order of the disciplinary authority.62. The charged officer was informed, vide memorandum dated 30.01.2013, that his appeal againstthe penalty of dismissal, addressed to the President of India, was taken up by the Ministry of HomeAffairs, and the Ministry of Home Affairs had considered and rejected the appeal, made by thepetitioner, as devoid of merit. Applicability of the principles of natural justice is not a rule of thumbor a straight jacket formula or even an abstract proposition of law. It depends on the facts of thecase, the nature of the inquiry, and the effect of the order/decision on the rights of the person andattendant circumstances. (Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Educationv. K.S. Gandhi and others42).63. The appellate authority, if it affirms an order, need not give separate reasons. However, if theappellate authority disagrees, the reasons must be contained in the order. (K.S. Gandhi42; and S.N.Mukherjee v. Union of India43). It is not required that the reasons to be assigned by the appellateauthority, while passing orders in a statutory appeal preferred against the order of punishment,should be as elaborate as in the decision of a Court of law. The extent and nature of the reasonswould depend on the particular facts and circumstances. (K.S. Gandhi42; and S.N. Mukherjee43).64. As elaborate reasons have been assigned by the Enquiry Committee in recording findings of guiltagainst the petitioner in its enquiry report, and as the findings and conclusions of the EnquiryCommittee had also been accepted by the Disciplinary Authority, it was unnecessary for theappellate authority to assign separate reasons in affirming the order of the appointing/disciplinaryauthority, and in rejecting the appeal as devoid of merits.VI. REPEATED ENQUIRIES: IS IT ILLEGAL, AND WAS THE THIRD ENQUIRY COMMITTEEPREJUDICED AGAINST THE PETITIONER?Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/2065. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that three different inquirieswere held against the petitioner only to punish him for acts of misconduct which he had notcommitted; repeated inquiries are impermissible, more so if they are held only to find the chargedemployee guilty of the charges; there was no material before the 2011 inquiry committee to hold thatthe charges levelled against the petitioner were established; the respondent, with a malafide intentand a biased attitude, had caused an inquiry once again; the inquiry report was submitted withoutconsidering the written defence submitted by the petitioner on 30.03.2011, and his defence briefdated 07.04.2011; the members of the 2011 inquiry committee were not impartial and independent;they had acted on the instructions of the disciplinary authority, and with a pre-determined mind, tohold the petitioner guilty of the charges; and they had failed to conduct the inquiry in accordancewith the Rules.66. It is not in dispute that the allegations, on which the charges are based, were made known to thedelinquent, and he was called upon to file his written statement. The oral evidence of all thewitnesses, tendered during the enquiry, was recorded in writing, and in the presence of themembers of the Inquiry Committee. The members of the Inquiry Committee did not record theirfindings separately, and their findings, on each of the charges, were recorded together with thereasons therefor. (General Manager, Eastern Railway and another v. Jwala Prosad Singh44). Theduty of the Inquiry Committee ends with the making of the report. The Disciplinary Authority hasthen to consider the record of the inquiry and arrive at his own conclusion on each charge. Whatevermay be the impression created by a particular witness, on the mind of a member of the committee, isnot recorded in writing, and the Disciplinary authority merely goes by the written record. (JwalaProsad Singh44). Neither the findings nor the recommendations of the Inquiry Committee arebinding on the disciplinary authority. (H.C. Goel12; and Jwala Prosad Singh44).67. A change in the composition of the Inquiry Committee, even after the proceedings are begun andsome evidence has been recorded, would not make any difference to the case of the delinquentemployee. The record would speak for itself and it is the record, consisting of the documents and theoral evidence, which would form the basis of the report of the Inquiry Committee. The InquiryCommittee is not the punishing authority, and its impression would not affect the decision of theDisciplinary Authority. There is no reason for holding that any known principle of natural justice isviolated when the member/members of the Inquiry Committee are substituted by another or others.(Union of India & others v. M.B. Patnaik and others45; and H.C. Goel12). It is not necessary,therefore, that an enquiry, which had been held in part by more than one enquiry officer, should becontinued by the same enquiry officers until the end. (M.B. Patnaik45).68. In this context, it is relevant to note that the first inquiry was held on the basis of the chargesheet dated 08.10.1999 issued to the petitioner under Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules which relates tominor penalty proceedings. Both the inquiry committee in its report dated 21.09.2001, and thedisciplinary authority in his order dated 12.09.2003, had held the petitioner guilty of the chargeslevelled against him. Consequent thereto, the disciplinary authority had imposed on him thepunishment of dismissal from service which is a major penalty. The petitioner had approached theCentral Administrative Tribunal questioning the validity of the said order of punishment. Whilesetting aside the said order on the ground that, having initiated minor penalty proceedings andBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/21having issued a charge sheet under Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules, no major penalty could have beenimposed on the petitioner, the Tribunal had, in its order in O.A. No.1632 of 203 dated 18.03.2005,granted liberty to the respondents to initiate disciplinary proceedings afresh under Rule 14 of the1965 Rules.69. Thereafter proceedings dated 05.12.2005 was issued by the Inspector General (Personnel)informing, among others, the petitioner that, consequent upon the order of punishment dated12.09.2003 being quashed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad Bench, with libertyreserved to the respondents to initiate fresh disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the rulesand the law on the subject, the President of India had decided that the said order of dismissal ofservice should be set aside; and on a consideration of the circumstances of the case, and keeping inview the observations of the Tribunal, it was decided that a fresh inquiry should be held under theprovisions of the 1965 Rules against the petitioner, on the allegations which had led to his dismissalfrom service earlier.70. By the said order dated 05.12.2005, the petitioner was also informed that the President had setaside the order of dismissal from service, along with the Notification dated 12.09.2003 by which thepetitioner's name was struck off the strength of the force; he was reinstated into service; a freshinquiry was directed to be held under the provisions of the 1965 Rules against him on theallegations, which led to his dismissal from service; and it was directed that the petitioner should,under Rule 10(4) of the 1965 Rules, be deemed to have been placed under suspension with effectfrom 12.09.2003, and would continue to remain under suspension until further orders.Consequential orders were passed by the Area Organizer (Admn.) on 13.03.2007.71. Instead of issuing a fresh charge sheet under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules, a four-member inquirycommittee was erroneously constituted, vide proceedings dated 12.06.2008, to conduct an inquiryon the basis of the very same charge sheet dated 08.10.1999. It is this inquiry committee which heldthat the charges levelled against the petitioner had not been proved. The disciplinary authority,while disagreeing with the findings of the said inquiry committee, had issued notice dated04.11.2009 to the petitioner to show cause. Thereafter, on its jurisdiction being invoked, the UPSChad pointed out this illegality. As a result, the earlier charge-sheet dated 08.10.1999 was cancelledby proceedings dated 04.01.2011, and a fresh charge-sheet was separately issued on the same day,i.e. 04.01.2011, and a fresh Enquiry Committee was constituted to enquire into the charges.72. The departmental inquiry, pursuant to the first charge sheet dated 08.10.1999, was conducted bythe Deputy Inspector General, S.S.B, A.P. Division, Itanagar and the order passed in the name of thePresident of India, imposing on him the punishment of dismissal from service, was communicatedto the petitioner by the Inspector General (Personnel) by proceedings dated 12.09.2003. Thecomplaints committee, constituted by the Director General SSB vide proceedings dated 12.06.2008to enquire into the allegations of sexual harassment against the petitioner, consisted of fourmembers with the IG, FTR-Patna as its Chairperson, a lady officer (who was AO Birpu) as onemember, a lady from an NGO as the second member, and the SAO (Legal) FTR Hqr Patna as thethird member. Of these four members, the Chairperson and the first and the second members werewomen. In their report dated 30.07.2008, the four-member Committee opined that the first chargeBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/22leveled against the petitioner was not proved, and the second charge could not be proved. It is withrespect to this departmental inquiry that a disagreement note was prepared by the DisciplinaryAuthority, and communicated to the petitioner.73. Thereafter, on a fresh charge-sheet being issued to the petitioner on 04.11.2011, a newfour-member Committee was constituted with three lady members. This four-member Committeewas different from the four-member Committee which had conducted the second departmentalinquiry earlier. The members of the inquiry committee, in all the three inquiries, were separate anddistinct. None of those, who constituted the first inquiry committee, were members of the second orthe third inquiry committees. Likewise, the members of the third inquiry committee were differentfrom that of the second inquiry committee. Consequently, the question of repeated inquiries havingbeen conducted with a pre-determined mind does not arise.74. Three separate inquiries were necessitated as the first inquiry was set aside by the CentralAdministrative Tribunal in its Order in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005 The second InquiryCommittee was constituted contrary to the orders of the Tribunal in O.A. 1632 of 2003 dated18.03.2005, and, on this error on its part being pointed by the Union Public Service Commission inits proceedings dated 12.08.2010, a third inquiry committee was constituted thereafter. While thefirst inquiry had culminated in the imposition of a punishment, which was set aside by the Tribunal,and liberty was granted to the respondents to initiate a disciplinary inquiry afresh, the secondinquiry was interdicted by the Union Public Service Commission even before an order ofpunishment, or otherwise, could be passed by the disciplinary authority. It is, thereafter, that thethird inquiry committee was constituted.75. It cannot, therefore, be said that holding three different inquiries against the petitioner is eitherillegal or with any malafide intent. The petitioner has not been able to show which of his contentionsin his written brief has not been considered by the inquiry committee, and how he has suffered anyprejudice thereby. The petitioner has not disclosed the basis for his submission that the inquiry wasnot impartial or independent, or that the enquiry committee had acted on the instructions of thedisciplinary authority. Allegations of malafides would necessitate examination by a Court only if theperson, against whom malice is alleged, is arrayed as a respondent eo-nominee, and is given anopportunity of being heard on these allegations. (State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma46). The petitionerhas neither chosen to array the members of the Inquiry Committee, nor the Disciplinary Authority,as respondents eo-nominee. It would be wholly inappropriate for us, therefore, to undertake anexamination of the petitioner's plea of malafides, bias or lack of impartiality. Even otherwise, theinquiry report is elaborate and all the petitioner's contentions have been dealt with. We see noreason, therefore, to interfere with the inquiry proceedings on this score. The contention, urgedunder this head, also necessitate rejection.VII. IS THE ENQUIRY COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF LOWER RANK OFFICERS, ILLEGAL?76. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the inquiry committeeconsisted of lower rank officials; and the disciplinary authority had erred in having an inquirycaused by lower rank officials, and in relying on their report.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/2377. In Vishaka & others vs. State of Rajasthan & others47, the Supreme Court framed norms andguidelines to prevent sexual harassment at work places. Clause (2) of the said guidelines definessexual harassment as: (a) physical contact and advances; (b) a demand or request for sexual favours;(c) sexually-coloured remarks; (d) showing pornography; and (e) any other unwelcome physical,verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. Clause (2) stipulates that, where any of these actsare committed in circumstances whereunder the victim of such conduct had a reasonableapprehension that in relation to the victim's employment or work, whether she was drawing salary,or honorarium or voluntary, whether in Government, public or private enterprise, such conduct canbe humiliating;it was discriminatory, for instance, when the woman had reasonable grounds to believe that herobjection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or work includingrecruitment or promotion or when it created a hostile work environment; and adverse consequencesmight be visited if the victim did not consent to the conduct in question, or raised any objectionthereto.78. Clause (5), of the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in Vishaka47, relates todisciplinary action, and stipulates that where such a conduct amounted to misconduct inemployment, as defined by the relevant service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should beinitiated by the employer in accordance with those rules. Clause (6) prescribes a complaintmechanism and thereunder, whether or not such conduct constituted an offence under the law or abreach of the service rules, an appropriate complaint mechanism should be created in theemployer's organization for redress of the complaint made by the victim; and such complaintmechanism should ensure a time-bound treatment of complaints. Clause (7) relates to complaintscommittees, and provides that the complaint mechanism, referred to in clause (6), should beadequate to provide, where necessary, a complaints committee, a special counsellor or other supportservice, including the maintenance of confidentiality; the complaints committee should be headedby a woman, and not less than half of its members should be women; and further, to prevent thepossibility of any undue pressure or influence from senior levels, such complaints committee shouldinvolve a third party, either NGO or other body which is familiar with the issue of sexualharassment.79. As noted hereinabove, the four member complaints committee, constituted to conduct a freshinquiry, pursuant to the charge-sheet dated 04.01.2011, consisted of three women. The guidelineslaid down by the Supreme Court, in Vishakha47, required the Chairman of the said committee to bea woman, at least 50 percent of the members of the Inquiry Committee to consist of women, andatleast one of them to be a third party preferably an NGO. It is in compliance with the guidelines inVishakha47, that the four member complaints committee was constituted. Consequently, the merefact that some of the members of the Inquiry Committee were junior lady officers is of noconsequence. Even otherwise, an Inquiry Officer / a Departmental Inquiry Committee is only adelegate of the disciplinary authority, and its functions are only to record its findings on the chargesleveled against the accused and nothing more. (H.C. Goel12). It matters little, therefore, that some ofthe members of the Committee were lady officers lower in rank than the petitioner, and some otherswere outsiders.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/24VIII. DID   THE     DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY  LACK      JURISDICTION TO DIRECT THAT A FRESH CHARGE-      SHEET BE ISSUED?80. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned Counsel for the petitioner, would submit that no action was taken bythe disciplinary authority to remit the case back to the Inquiry Authority and he had, instead,directed that a fresh charge sheet be issued; this was not within his jurisdiction, more so as adetailed inquiry report had been submitted pursuant to the earlier charge- sheet; issuing a freshcharge sheet was contrary to law and without jurisdiction; the respondent-authorities wereprejudiced against the petitioner and had, therefore, directed that a fresh charge sheet be issuedagainst him; initiation of de-novo inquiry proceedings is not permissible under the Rules; and allthe orders issued by the respondents are, therefore, liable to be quashed.81. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel for the Union of India, wouldsubmit that the advice of the UPSC was that the earlier charge sheet, issued under Rule 16 of the1965 Rules, could not be made the basis for conducting an inquiry against the petitioner forimposition of a major penalty; the earlier charge sheet was therefore cancelled, and a fresh chargesheet was issued under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules initiating major penalty proceedings; the order ofthe Tribunal in O.A. No.1632 dated 18.03.2005, which has attained finality, is binding both on thepetitioner and the respondents herein; and, in terms of the said order, the respondents were givenliberty to initiate inquiry proceedings after issuing a fresh charge sheet.82. The 1965 Rules were made by the President of India in the exercise of the powers conferred bythe proviso to Articles 309 and 148 of the Constitution of India. Rule 11 thereof relates to thepenalties which can be imposed on a government servant i.e. minor penalties and major penalties.The punishment of dismissal from service is a major penalty under Rule 11 (ix) of the 1965 Rules. Itis only the punishment of censure, withholding of promotion, recovery from pay of the whole or partof any pecuniary loss caused by the charge-sheeted employee to the Government by negligence orbreach of orders, reduction to a lower stage in the time- scale of pay for a period not exceeding threeyears without cumulative effect and not adversely affecting his pension, and withholding ofincrements of pay, which constitute minor penalties.83. The procedure for taking action against a charged officer, for imposing a minor penalty, isdistinct and different from the procedure prescribed for imposing major penalties. Part VI of the1965 Rules relates to the procedure for imposing penalties and Rule 14(1), which is procedure forimposing major penalties, requires that no order, imposing any of the penalties specified in clauses(v) to (ix) of Rule 11, shall be made except after an inquiry is held, as far as may be, in the mannerprovided by the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850; the disciplinary authority may appoint aninquiry officer under the rules; he should draw up the substance of the imputations of misconduct ormisbehavior into definite and distinct articles of charge; and thereafter an inquiry should beconducted etc. Unlike in the case of imposition of a major penalty (the procedure for which isprescribed in Rule 14), Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules prescribes the procedure for imposing minorpenalties and thereunder, for imposition of a minor penalty under Rule 11, the government servantis required to be informed that action is proposed to be taken against him for the imputation ofBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/25misconduct, for an inquiry to be held taking into consideration the representations submitted by thegovernment servant, and for recording a finding on each imputation of misbehaviour.84. Since the earlier charge sheet, issued to the petitioner on 08.10.1999, was under Rule 16 of the1965 Rules, the disciplinary authority could not have imposed a major penalty, such as dismissalfrom service, without adhering to the procedure prescribed, for imposing major penalties, underRule 14 of the 1965 Rules. It is, in such circumstances, that the Central Administrative Tribunal hadquashed the order of punishment, granting liberty to the respondents to initiate disciplinaryproceedings by issuing a fresh charge sheet under Rule 14. Instead of doing so, the disciplinaryauthority had, on the basis of the earlier charge sheet dated 08.10.1999, commenced disciplinaryproceedings under Rule 14; and it is this error on its part which was pointed out by the UPSC,necessitating the earlier charge-sheet being cancelled, and a fresh charge sheet being issued, underRule 14 of the 1965 Rules on 04.01.2011.85. The action taken by the disciplinary authority, in directing that a fresh charge-sheet be issuedunder Rule 14 after cancelling the earlier charge-sheet issued under Rule 16, is in strict compliancewith the order of the Tribunal in OA No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005, which order of theTribunal has attained finality and is binding both on the petitioner and the respondents. Since theorder of the Tribunal obligated the disciplinary authority to issue a fresh charge-sheet under Rule14, in case it intended to take action against the petitioner for the misconduct of sexual molestation,the action taken, in cancelling the earlier charge-sheet and in issuing a fresh charge sheet thereafter,is in strict compliance with the order of the Tribunal and cannot, therefore, be faulted. Thecontentions that the disciplinary authority lacked jurisdiction to issue a fresh charge-sheet, andinitiation of de-novo proceedings is not permissible under the Rules, are devoid of merits andnecessitate rejection.IX. DID THE UPSC LACK JURISDICTION TO ADVICE THAT A FRESH CHARGE-SHEET BEISSUED?86. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that, under the proviso toRule 15 (3) of the 1965 Rules, the UPSC can only advise the disciplinary authority regarding thepenalty to be imposed on the charged officer; the Rules did not authorize the UPSC to advise thedisciplinary authority to re-issue a fresh charge sheet, by canceling the earlier charge sheet; therespondent had mis-interpreted the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal; issuance of a freshcharge sheet, by the disciplinary authority, was ultra-vires the power of recommendation of theUPSC, and was illegal; the UPSC lacked jurisdiction to interpret judgments/orders of Courts/Tribunals; and the UPSC had limited jurisdiction, and could only make recommendations withregards imposition of penalty.87. Article 320 of the Constitution relates to the functions of the Public Service Commission. Article320(3)(c) requires the Union Public Service Commission to be consulted on all disciplinary mattersaffecting a person serving under the Government of India, including memorials or petitions relatingto such matters; and it shall be the duty of the Public Service Commission to advise on any matter soreferred to them, and on any other matter which the President may refer to them. Under the provisoBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/26to Rule 15(3) of the 1965 Rules, in every case where it is necessary to consult the UPSC, the record ofthe inquiry shall be forwarded by the Disciplinary Authority to the UPSC for its advice, and suchadvice shall be taken into consideration before making an order imposing any penalty. It is in termsof Article 320(3)(c) of the Constitution of India, read with the proviso to Rule 15(3) of the 1965Rules, that the Union Public Service Commission was consulted in the matter.88. Government servants of the Union or the State are normally entitled to the protection of thethree constitutional safeguards provided in Articles 311(1), 311(2) and 320(3)(c) of the Constitutionof India. (Pradyat Kumar Bose v. Chief Justice, Calcutta HC48). The phrase "all disciplinary mattersaffecting a person", in Article 320(3)(c), is sufficiently comprehensive to include any kind ofdisciplinary action proposed to be taken in respect of a particular person. (Pradyat Kumar Bose48).89. The submission that the UPSC lacked jurisdiction to advice the disciplinary authority regardingissuance of a fresh charge-sheet is not tenable. All that the UPSC did was to inform the disciplinaryauthority that its action, in initiating a second inquiry based on the earlier charge-sheet dated08.10.1999 issued under Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules, was contrary to the order of the Tribunal in O.A.No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005. As noted hereinabove, the Tribunal had, in its order in O.A. No.1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005, held that imposition of the major penalty of dismissal from service,based on a charge-sheet issued under Rule 16 of the 1965 Rules (which relates to minor penaltyproceedings), and without issuing a fresh charge-sheet under Rule 14 (which relates to majorpenalty proceedings), was illegal. These observations of the Tribunal, made on its jurisdiction beinginvoked by the petitioner himself, are binding both on the petitioner and the respondent, more so asthe said order has attained finality. Even, in the absence of any advice from the UPSC, the action ofthe disciplinary authority, in conducting an inquiry based on the earlier charge- sheet dated08.10.1999, fell foul of the order of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005, andwas illegal.90. An order passed by a Court/Tribunal of competent jurisdiction, after adjudication on merits ofthe rights of the parties, binds the parties or the persons claiming right, title or interest from them.Its validity can be assailed only in an appeal or review. In subsequent proceedings, its validitycannot be questioned. (Sushil Kumar Metha Vs. Gobind Ram Bohra49). It cannot also be re-agitatedin collateral proceedings. An order or judgment of a Court/Tribunal, even if erroneous, is bindinginter-parties. The binding character of judgments, of Courts / Tribunals of competent jurisdiction, isin essence a part of the rule of law on which the administration of justice is founded. (The DirectRecruit Class-II Engineering Officers' Association and others vs. State of Maharashtra and others50;U.P. State Road Transport Corporation vs. State of U.P. and others51).91. Matters in controversy decided after full contest, after affording fair opportunity to the parties toprove their case, by a Court / Tribunal competent to decide it, and which proceedings have attainedfinality, is binding inter-parties. (Gulabchand Chhotalal Parikh vs. State of Bombay (NowGujarat)52; State of Punjab vs. Bua Das Kaushal53). Once a matter, which was the subject-matter ofa lis, stood determined by a competent Court / Tribunal, no party can thereafter be permitted toreopen it in a subsequent litigation. (Swamy Atmananda and Ors. vs. Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanamand Ors54; Ishwar Dutt vs. Land Acquisition Collector and Anr55). Issues which have beenBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/27concluded inter-parties cannot be raised again in proceedings inter-parties. (State of Haryana vs.State of Punjab and Anr56). The UPSC had merely reminded the disciplinary authority of itsobligations to comply with the order of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005 andnothing more. It is unnecessary for us to dwell on this aspect any further, since the order of theTribunal in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005, a judgment inter- parties, is binding both onthe petitioner and the respondents.X.    WAS THE EARLIER CHARGE-SHEET CANCELLED BY AN      AUTHORITY SUBORDINATE IN RANK TO THE      AUTHORITY WHICH ISSUED IT?92. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the charge sheet issuedon 08.10.1999 was by the Director to the Government of India in the Cabinet Secretariat/PrimeMinister's Office; the power to cancel, modify or review the 1999 charge sheet also vested with thesame authority; however, in 2011, a sub-ordinate authority i.e. the Assistant Director (Pers-I), lowerin status to the Director to the Government, had cancelled the earlier charge sheet issued by theDirector to the Government of India.93. Rule 12 of the 1965 Rules relates to disciplinary authorities and, under sub-rule (1), thePresident may impose any of the penalties specified in Rule 11 on any Government servant. Rule12(2) enables imposition of any of the penalties specified in Rule 11 on (a) a member of a CentralCivil Service other than the General Central Service, by the appointing authority or the authorityspecified in the schedule in this behalf or by any other authority empowered in this behalf by ageneral or special order of the President; and (b) a person appointed to a Central Civil Post includedin the General Central Service, by the authority specified in this behalf by a general or special orderof the President or, where such order has not been made, by the appointing authority or theauthority specified in the Schedule in this behalf. Rule 13 relates to the authority to instituteproceedings and, under sub-rule (1), the President, or any other authority empowered by him bygeneral or special order, may - (a) institute disciplinary proceedings against any Governmentservant; and (b) direct a disciplinary authority to institute disciplinary proceedings against anyGovernment servant on whom that disciplinary authority is competent to impose, under the 1965Rules, any of the penalties specified in Rule 11. Rule 13(2) stipulates that a disciplinary authority,competent under the 1965 Rules to impose any of the penalties specified in clauses (i) to (iv) of Rule11, may institute disciplinary proceedings against any Government servant for the imposition of anyof the penalties specified in clauses (v) to (ix) of Rule 11 notwithstanding that such disciplinaryauthority is not competent, under the 1965 Rules, to impose any of the latter penalties. It is evident,therefore, that the power to institute disciplinary proceedings can be exercised not only by thedisciplinary authority who is competent to impose a major penalty, but by others also.94. A statutory functionary, exercising the power to impose punishment pursuant to a disciplinaryenquiry, cannot be said to have delegated his functions merely by deputing a responsible andcompetent official, among others, to enquire and report. What cannot be delegated, except wherethe law specifically so provides, is only the ultimate responsibility for the exercise of such power(Pradyat Kumar Bose48) ie the power to impose punishment.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/2895. Article 311(1) provides that no person, who is a member of the Civil Service of the Union or of anAll India Service, or holds a civil post under the Union, shall be dismissed or removed by anauthority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. This Article does not, in specific terms,require that the authority, empowered under that provision to dismiss or remove an official, shoulditself initiate or conduct the enquiry preceding the dismissal or removal of the officer, or even thatthe enquiry should be held at his instance. The only right guaranteed to a civil servant under thatprovision is that he shall not be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by whichhe was appointed. (State of Madhya Pradesh and others v. Shardul Singh57). The guarantee, givenunder Article 311(1), does not include within it a further guarantee that the disciplinary proceedings,resulting in dismissal or removal of a civil servant, should also be initiated and conducted by theauthorities mentioned in that Article. (Shardul Singh57). Initiation or enquiry by an officer,subordinate to the appointing authority, is unobjectionable. Such initiation can be at the behest ofan officer subordinate to the appointing authority. Only dismissal/removal shall not be passed by anauthority subordinate to the appointing authority. (Transport Commissioner, Madras-5 v. A. RadhaKrishna Moorthy58).96. The embargo imposed by Article 311(2) is on the imposition of punishment of dismissal /removal by an authority lower in rank than the appointing authority. Protection, even under the saidArticle, does not extend to initiation of disciplinary proceedings or for cancellation of the earliercharge-sheet. Moreover, the order cancelling the earlier charge-sheet was only in terms of the libertygranted by the Tribunal in its order in O.A. No. 1632 of 2003 dated 18.03.2005, and in compliancewith its directions that major penalty proceedings, under Rule 14 of the 1965 Rules, could not beinitiated based on the earlier charge-sheet dated 08.10.1999 issued under Rule 16 of the 1965 Ruleswhich relates to minor penalty proceedings. In such circumstances, mere cancellation of the earliercharge-sheet, by an authority lower in rank than the officer who had issued it earlier, is of noconsequence, more so as no constitutional or statutory protection is conferred on a delinquentemployee in this regard. This contention, urged on behalf of the petitioner, does not also meritacceptance.XI.    WAS THE PUNISHMENT IMPOSED ON THE PETITIONER       DISPROPORTIONATE?97. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the punishmentimposed on the petitioner is grossly disproportionate to the charges held established; and therespondents had, in their counter affidavit, admitted that the punishment imposed on the petitionerwas grossly disproportionate to the charges held proved.98. On the other hand Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Union of India,would submit that, while para 72 of the counter affidavit could undoubtedly have been moreelaborate, it cannot be understood as an admission that the punishment imposed on the petitionerwas disproportionate; and in the light of the misconduct held established, of molestation and sexualharassment, the punishment of dismissal from service cannot be said to be disproportionate to thecharges held established.Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/2999. When charge(s) of misconduct are proved in an enquiry, the quantum of punishment to beimposed in a particular case is essentially in the domain of the departmental authorities. Courtswould not take upon itself the task of the disciplinary/departmental authorities to decide thequantum of punishment or the nature of penalty to be awarded. Limited judicial review is available,to interfere with the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority, only in cases where suchpenalty shocks the conscience of the Court. (Naresh Chandra Bhardwaj vs. Bank of India andOrs.59; Lucknow Kshetriya Gramin Bank (Now Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank) and Anr. v.Rajendra Singh60). The High Court would not, as a court of appeal, go into the question of adequacyor sufficiency of the punishment. It is for the disciplinary authority to consider what should be thenature of the punishment to be imposed on a Government servant based upon the misconductproved against him. (Nand Kishore Shukla14).100. The power to reduce the penalty imposed by the disciplinary authority, which vests with theappellate authority departmentally, is, ordinarily, not available to the Court or a Tribunal. TheCourt, while undertaking judicial review, would not substitute its own opinion for that of thecompetent authority, (Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangthan v. J. Hussain61; Krishna District Coop. CentralBank Ltd. v. K. Hanumantha Rao62; UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli v. Gulabhia M. Lad63), as it doesnot sit in appeal over decisions qua the nature and quantum of punishment. It is only in exceptionalcircumstances, where it is found that the punishment/penalty awarded by the disciplinaryauthority/employer is wholly disproportionate, that too to an extent that it shocks its conscience,that the Court steps in and interferes. (K. Hanumantha Rao62).101. However, the punishment should not be so disproportionate to the offence as to shock theconscience and amount, in itself, to conclusive evidence of bias. If the decision as to punishment isin outrageous defiance of logic, then the order would not be immune from correction. Irrationalityand perversity are recognised grounds of judicial review. (Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India andOrs.64; and Ex-Naik Sardar Singh v. Union of India65).102. Award of punishment, which is grossly in excess of the allegations proved, cannot claimimmunity, and is open for interference, under the limited scope of judicial review, based on thedoctrine of proportionality. (K. Hanumantha Rao62; State of Jharkhand v. Kamal Prasad66). Whenthe punishment is found to be outrageously disproportionate to the nature of the charge, principlesof proportionality come into play. It is, however, to be borne in mind that this principle would beattracted, which is in tune with the Wednesbury (1948) 1 KB 223 rule of reasonableness, only when,in the facts and circumstances of the case, the penalty imposed is so disproportionate to the natureof charge that it gives rise to the belief that it is totally unreasonable and arbitrary. (KendriyaVidyalaya Sangthan61; K. Hanumantha Rao62).103. Any penalty grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct would violate Article 14 ofthe Constitution (Bhagat Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh67; and Ex-Naik Sardar Singh65), andwould be an act in excess of jurisdiction. (V.R. Katarki v. State of Karnataka and others68; and Stateof U.P. and othersv. Ashok Kumar Singh and another69).Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/30104. Even in cases where the punishment is set aside as shockingly disproportionate to the nature ofcharges framed against the delinquent employee, the appropriate course of action is to remit thematter back to the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority with a direction to passappropriate order of penalty. The Court would not, by itself, ordinarily mandate as to what shouldbe the penalty in such a case. (Naresh Chandra Bhardwaj59; Rajendra Singh60). If the punishmentimposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority shocks the conscience of the HighCourt/Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the relief, either directing the disciplinary/appellateauthority to reconsider the penalty imposed or to shorten the litigation it may itself, in exceptionaland rare cases, impose appropriate punishment with cogent reasons in support thereof. (B.C.Chaturvedi vs. Union of India70).105. Courts may interfere with the punishment imposed when it is found to be totally irrational or isoutrageously in defiance of logic or is shockingly disproportionate, suggesting lack of good faith.Otherwise the opinion of the Court, that a lesser punishment would have been more appropriate,would not justify interference with the discretion exercised by the departmental authorities inimposing punishment for proved misconduct. (J. Hussain61; K. Hanumantha Rao62).106. In the present case the Disciplinary Authority imposed, on the petitioner, the punishment ofdismissal from service after concurring with the findings and conclusions of the Inquiry Committeethat both Charges 1 and 2 were proved. The first charge, as noted hereinabove, related to sexualabuse and molestation by a superior paramilitary officer over his subordinate lady trainee. In theParamilitary Forces, where the need to maintain discipline is of a very high order, such acts of asuperior officer, in taking advantage of the vulnerability of a subordinate lady trainee and inindulging in such heinous acts of molestation and sexual abuse, justified the deterrent punishmentof dismissal from service being imposed on him. Under no circumstances, be it in the ParamilitaryForces or elsewhere, can such acts either be condoned or a lenient view be taken thereof. The secondcharge, as held established is that the petitioner, after having indulged in such heinous acts, as alsohis father who was a high ranked official, in the cadre of Deputy Inspector General in the SashastraSeema Bal, had sought to pressurize the complainant to withdraw the complaint.107. The deponent of the counter-affidavit, filed in the present Writ Petition, is the Commandant,SSB, Gwaldam. It is not for him to sit in judgment over the decision of the President of India inimposing the punishment of dismissal from service on the petitioner for the charges heldestablished. His concession, that the punishment is not proportionate, is therefore of noconsequence. Even otherwise, we are satisfied that the punishment, imposed on the petitioner ofdismissal from service, is commensurate to the charges held established. The contention urged onbehalf of the petitioner, that the punishment of dismissal from service is shockinglydisproportionate, therefore necessitates rejection.XII. FAILURE TO CONSIDER RULE 353 OF THE CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS: ITSCONSEQUENCE:108. Mr. Sanjay Raturi, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit that Rule 353 of the CivilServices Regulations, which confers power on the authorities to grant compassionate allowance,Bhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/31even where the charges held established has resulted in imposition of the penalty of dismissal /removal from service, has not been considered by the respondents.109. Mr. Sanjay Bhatt, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Union of India, would fairly statethat what was admitted in the counter- affidavit was the existence of Regulation 353 of the CivilServices Regulations, and not that the punishment was disproportionate.110. Rule 353 of the Civil Services Regulations reads as under:-"No pension may be granted to an officer dismissed or removed for misconduct,insolvency or inefficiency, but to an officer so dismissed or removed, compassionateallowance may be granted when he is deserving of special consideration, providedthat the allowance granted to any officer shall not exceed two third of the pensionwhich would have been admissible to him if he had retired on invalid pension".111. In terms of Rule 353 the officer, dismissed or removed for misconduct, is not entitled for grantof pension. He may, however, be granted compassionate allowance, despite his dismissal orremoval, if he is found deserving of special consideration. Payment of such compassionate allowanceis restricted, by the proviso, to an amount not exceeding 2/3rd of the pension which would havebeen admissible to the officer if he had retired on an invalid pension. While we see no reason tointerfere with the punishment imposed on the petitioner of dismissal from service, for sexualmisconduct and molestation of a sub-ordinate trainee and in attempting to coerce her to withdrawher complaint, the authorities concerned, despite imposing the punishment of dismissal fromservice on the petitioner, were, nonetheless, required to examine whether or not there werecircumstances deserving of special consideration in the petitioner's case for him to be grantedcompassionate allowance.112. Since the authorities concerned have not exercised their powers under Rule 353, suffice it topermit the petitioner to make a representation to the competent authority requesting him toexercise his powers under Rule353. On any such representation being made, the competent authority shall, within a period of onemonth from the date of receipt of any such representation, consider the petitioner's claim, for grantof compassionate allowance, in accordance with law, and pass appropriate orders thereupon. Weexpress no opinion on whether or not the petitioner is entitled for grant of compassionate allowance,and make it clear that, in case the competent authority arrives at a considered decision thatcompassionate allowance should be paid, the petitioner shall then be paid the amounts due withintwo months from the date on which an order is passed by the competent authority.XIII. CONCLUSION:113. For the reasons stated hereinabove, we see no reason to interfere either with the inquiryproceedings or with the order of punishment of dismissal from service imposed on the petitioner.The petitioner is, however, permitted to invoke Rule 353 by way of a representation which shall beBhuwan Chandra Pandey vs Union Of India And Others on 15 June, 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47071247/32considered by the competent authority as directed hereinabove. The Writ Petition is, accordingly,disposed of. However, in the circumstances, without costs.       (R.C. Khulbe, J.)
