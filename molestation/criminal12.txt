Asha Ram, (2005) 13 SCC 766). Inthe instant case, the victim is a young girl and the accused is her father, a clear case of 'Protectorturning predator' as submitted by the learned Prosecutor.2. The trial court convicted the accused based on the evidence led before it by way of fifteen exhibitsand eleven witnesses. The defence marked one exhibit as a contradiction from the statement ofPW4. Separate sentences for imprisonment for life under Sections 376 and 377 IPC and a fineamount of Rs.25,000/- each, with default sentence was imposed on the accused. The sentence wasalso ordered to be run concurrently. We heard the learned Counsel Lavaraj M.G. for the appellantand Smt. Ambika Devi, Special Government Pleader (Atrocities against women and children)appearing for the State.3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the victim does not have a consistent case andthis reveals the falsity of the allegations. It is pointed out that the mother and brother of the victimturned hostile. There is gross delay in the registration of the crime. The child had an affair withanother person, which was objected to by the father and the complaint raised was a mere backlash.Without admitting the allegations or accepting the evidence let in, the learned Counsel would alsopray for indulgence insofar as the sentences, especially since the allegation of rape is anembellishment in the evidence before court. The appellant relied on Santosh Prasad @ SantoshKumar v. State of Bihar, (2020) 3 SCC 443 to argue that when there are material contradictions inthe evidence led by the prosecution and there is a delay in lodging an FIR, a conviction cannot besustained. Bhudeb Uchai v. State of Tripura, 2020 KHC 4378 of the Tripura High Court, State ofUttarakhand v. Subash, 2019 KHC 5450 and Indra Mani Thapliyal v. State of Uttarakhand, 2013KHC 3138; both Division Bench decisions of the Uttarakhand High Court, were relied on to set asidethe conviction and alternatively to argue for mitigation insofar as the sentence is concerned.4. The learned Special Government Pleader on the other hand, would caution us, relying on AshaRam, from showing any indulgence to such depraved people, who turn their lascivious eye on theirchildren, that too of tender age. It is also pointed out that the legislature keeping in mind theincrease of such crimes of depravity, brought in comprehensive amendments bringing varioussexual acts under the definition of rape and substantially enhancing the punishment, to even deathin cases of abject depravity; interalia of minor children being subjected to rape by their guardians.Ravi v. State of Maharashtra, (2019) 9 SCC 622 declared that a purposive interpretation of the penalprovisions has to be made, especially keeping in mind the subsequent amendments brought in bythe legislature, even if such offences are committed before such amendments. It is pointed out thatthe mother was only shielding the father especially since she had signed on the FIS given by thedaughter. Though in the FIS only digital penetration was alleged by the victim; before the Doctor,she alleged penile penetration also. There is no delay in making the complaint since the child hadput forth the threat of suicide levelled by her father, as having dissuaded her from disclosure. SheNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/2also spoke of the crime to her family and there is no challenge to the explanation, in thecross-examination. The explanation proffered, if not challenged, there can be no ground raised onthat aspect as has been held in State of U.P. v. Nahar Singh, (1998) 3 SCC 561. Yanab Sheikh v. Stateof W.B., (2013) 6 SCC 428 is also relied on.5. Ext.P4 is the FIS given by PW4 on 12.02.2013. PW4's family moved into the presentaccommodation a month back, and before that, they were at a different rental accommodation,where they lived for about six months. She is one among the six siblings and her elder sister wasmarried off; the remaining are two elder brothers and two younger sisters. Her eldest brother isemployed and the other brother is also a school going child. The allegation was that one day whenshe was sleeping alone in the kitchen her father came to her, drunk. He caught hold of her, touchedher all over, especially on the breasts. Her clothes were removed and he pressed on various parts ofher body. He also touched her vagina and inserted his finger many times into the vagina. Sheprotested and threatened that she would disclose it to her mother, and at this point, her fatherthreatened to commit suicide if she does so. She alleged that the molestation was repeated by herfather many times even when her mother was present in the house. She also spoke of a time whenher mother and brother were away concerning a bereavement. She was alone in the house with heryounger sisters and father for three days when molestation of like nature was repeated. When herelder sister came home, she divulged her travails to her. The sister then took PW4 to her maritalhouse and then PW4 returned after three months just before the examinations. She resumed schooland on the first day, due to her long absence, she had to meet the Headmaster. When theHeadmaster enquired about her absence, she told him of what transpired. She admitted that shewas not molested in the present residence. She spoke about the molestation to her brother, PW7,who informed the same to the mother and elder sister. She lamented that every day her father comeshome drunk and she did not divulge her travails only because of the threat levelled by her father.She claimed that the harassment commenced and continued when the family was staying atVeettoor; before they moved to the present residence. She also claimed that she had spoken to hermother about the molestation, which was not taken seriously.6. PW4 in her evidence spoke in tandem with the FIS but made some embellishments. She deposedthat she was molested between May and September of 2012 and then the three days when hermother was away to call on a bereaved family. She also said that she was so harassed till 2013, whichwas later corrected as in 2012. While in the FIS, she said she was with her sister for three months,before court she said she was away only for two weeks. She also claimed that when she was at hersister's house, her parents had shifted their residence to Mazhuvanoor, where she had made astatement to the police. While describing the molestation, in addition to digital penetration shealleged penile penetration too. She categorically stated that after the very first incident, she hadinformed the same to her brother, ie. the one named Mithun, PW7, who informed the fact to theirmother. After she divulged the reason for her absence to the Headmaster, personnel from theChild-line had interacted with her. Later, the police came home to record her statement. She alsoasserted that she gave a statement before the Magistrate, but none was produced. She claimed thatboth her sisters were now staying at Sevika Samajam. In cross-examination, she said that she washarassed by her father in 2012 and not up to 2013. She claimed that she was taken to her sister'smarital home after the last incident. However, she does not remember the day on which she wasNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/3taken to her sister's home or the day she resumed school. She denied having stated to the police thatshe was with her sister for three months (marked as Ext.D1) and claimed that she only told thepolice of staying at her sister's home for two weeks. She alleged that she had disclosed the penilepenetration to the police. In cross-examination, she claimed that she was with her family for twomonths before she went to her sister's place and during those two months, she had not attendedschool. She denied any relationship with one Biju; to a suggestion made by the defence.7. The complaint arose when the victim first disclosed the incident to the Headmaster of the school,who was examined as PW3. PW3 identified the accused standing in the dock, who was the father of astudent of his school. He attested the date of birth of the student to be 28.01.2000 as per the registermaintained at the school, an extract of which was produced as Ext.P3. He stated that fromNovember 2012 the student was continuously absent from class and hence her name was removedfrom the rolls. Later, in February 2013 the student came back to the school and was readmitted.When she was asked the reason for her continued long absence, it was informed to him that she wassubjected to harassment by her father and hence was shifted from her parental residence to hersister's marital home. The HM immediately informed the Child-line, from where the personnel cameto the school and talked to the student. PW3 affirmed that one Shiny from Child-line visited theschool. Then, a CI and two policemen came to the school and enquired with the student, ie: thevictim. In cross-examination, he clarified that the Child- line officials talked to the victim on the firstday when she resumed studies. On the next day, the student was allowed to attend the classes asdirected by the Child-line official and it was on that day the policemen questioned her. He assertedthat the victim had spoken of the harassment directly to him. The absence of the studentcommenced from 27.11.2012, according to the HM. A contradiction was marked insofar as the HMhaving told the police that when enquiries were made, the class teacher and other teachers informedhim about the sexual harassment. He clarified that when the student came to the school after a longabsence, the class teacher brought her to him and the student spoke of the sexual harassmentdirectly to him.8. The FIS was on 12.02.2013 at 5.30 PM, presumably on the date on which the victim returned toschool after a long absence. She was examined by PW1 doctor on 15.02.2013 when she wasaccompanied by a Woman CPO and the mother, the latter of whom had given consent. The historygiven by the child was stated to be 'father having sexually harassed her on every day in the monthsof November-December 2012'(sic). The harassment was also stated to be 'vaginal digital explorationand penile penetration'(sic). The examination findings were that there was no general or genitalinjury but the hymen showed an old tear and the vagina admitted two fingers. On the strength of thefindings on examination, the doctor opined that there was no evidence of recent sexual harassment,but indications are of penetration. The certificate was marked as Ext.P1. PW2 is the doctor whoexamined the accused and certified his potency. PW5 is the owner of the residential building atVeettoor where the alleged incidents occurred; which house was rented out by the family of thevictim.9. PW6 is the mother of the victim and the wife of the accused, who turned hostile. She refused totoe the line of the prosecution, despite having accepted that she signed on the FIS after herdaughter. The mother said that her eldest daughter had told her about the accused having saidNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/4something to the victim, and when she enquired with her husband, he denied any harassment oftheir daughter. She denied the statements put to her from the Section 161 statement, which weremarked as Exts.P6 and P6(a). The contradictions indicated that she was aware of the father havingapproached their daughter at night, in the kitchen to sexually harass her. In cross-examination,PW6 stated that PW4 had never spoken of the incident to her. But she added that her son anddaughter had spoken to her about the incident. She asserted that the victim had a relationship withone Biju, who was the door checker of a bus and her husband was enraged about the same. PW7 wasthe minor son of PW6, who also turned hostile before court. He stated that his sister had informedhim that their father caught hold of her and he had spoken of the same to his mother and eldestsister. However, he said that there was no sexual harassment spoken of by his sister. Thecontradictions were marked as Ext.P7 series from the Section 161 Statement. In cross- examination,PW7 stated that before his sister was taken to Kottarakkara, there was no quarrel between his fatherand the sister. He said that the victim went to their elder sister's house in October and returned inFebruary. PW7, who was studying with the victim in the same school, did not affirm the relationshipbetween the door checker and his sister and merely said that he has seen her talking to the saidperson.10. PW8 is the WCPO, who recorded the FIS (Ext.P4). She specifically stated in cross-examinationthat there was no penile penetration spoken of by the victim while giving the FIS. In re-examination,PW8 states that on 15.02.2013 penile penetration was spoken of by the victim. The victim also toldPW8 that earlier she purposefully hid the said fact because her father had threatened to commitsuicide. PW9 is the SI of Police, who deputed PW8 to take the FIS of the victim on a report dated12.02.2013 received from the Juvenile Police Unit. He registered Ext.P9 FIR, based on Ext.P4 FIS.He commenced investigation on the very next day and arrested the accused, the memo of which wasmarked as Ext.P10 and the inspection memo as Ext.P11. After producing the accused before court asper Ext.P13 remand report, he transmitted the files to the CI of Police Kunnathunad. Incross-examination, he admitted that in the initial report there was no allegation of 'sexualrelationship' (presumably intercourse) and hence the child was not sent for medical examination.The said initial report of the District Juvenile Unit of the Police is not produced before Court. PW10is the investigating officer (I.O), who carried out the investigation and filed the final report.11. The evidence led on certain aspects can be said to be inconsistent. Considering the nature of theallegations and the relationship between the parties, this Court has to carefully scrutinize theevidence to find whether the inconsistencies are gross enough to doubt the credibility of theprosecutrix and disbelieve her on the specific allegation of sexual molestation. PW4 did not speak ofa penile penetration at the first instance when FIS was recorded and the only allegation was ofdigital penetration. The learned Prosecutor has emphasized the medical report, which was threedays later, on 15.02.2013 (Ext.P1). Before Court also PW4 deposed about a penile penetration. Thehistory recorded by PW1, deposed verbatim by the doctor, includes penile penetration. PW8, theWCPO who recorded the FIS, categorically stated in the cross-examination that the victim did notspeak of a penile penetration on the first day when the FIS was recorded. In re-examination, shesaid that on 15.02.2013, ie: the date on which the victim was taken for medical examination; sheinformed the WCPO that on the first day the accused had carried out penile penetration. But on theday of recording FIS, she did not disclose it, for the reason of the threat of suicide levelled by herNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/5father. This is a threat spoken of by the victim, also as an explanation for the delay in registration ofthe FIR. But we see that there is inconsistency insofar as the disclosure was made to her family.12. PW4, in the FIS alleged that her father threatened her with suicide if she disclosed themolestation. But in the FIS itself, she also said that she had spoken of the same to her brother, PW7,who had communicated it to the mother, PW6 and her eldest sister. She repeated the same beforethe court. The evidence of PW6, though declared hostile, as is trite, need not be eschewed in itsentirety. Though she refused to toe the prosecution line, in cross- examination for the accused, shespeaks of having been informed of the 'incident' by her son and daughter. The mother does notclarify what the 'incident' was and it can be safely inferred that there was an incident as spoken of bythe victim. PW7, the brother also speaks of the victim having told him about the incident, which wasconveyed to PW6, the mother. We do not find any credence insofar as the threat said to have beenlevelled by the father to ensure the silence of the daughter. PW4, the victim, definitely informed herfamily immediately after the incident.13. At the first instance, the prosecutrix had no case of penile penetration. When an allegation ofsexual molestation is made against the father, that too, of penetration with fingers, we fail to seewhy the penile penetration aspect should alone be hidden for fear of the perpetrator committingsuicide. That allegation was made for the first time on 15.02.2013, when she was examined by thedoctor, PW1. This was after two days of reporting of the offence and PW9 explains that in the initialreport by the District Juvenile Unit of the Police, there was no allegation of sexual intercourse.Considering all these circumstances and the failure to produce the initial report of the Juvenile Unit,we are compelled to find the allegation of penile penetration to be an embellishment, which cannotbe reckoned as against the accused and he cannot be charged for the offence of rape under section376 IPC, as it stood at the time of commission of offence.14. On the question of sexual molestation specifically of digital penetration, we have the evidence ofthe prosecutrix. The appellant however would emphasize the evidence of the mother and thebrother, PW6 and PW7. As we noticed, both of them turned hostile, but that does not result in therejection of the entire evidence of the said witnesses. It is trite that the principle of 'Falsus in UnoFalsus in Omnibus' has no application to this land and the evidence of hostile witnesses need not betotally eschewed. We rely on the decision of the Division Bench in Muhammed Faisal T.P @ Faisal v.Inspector of Police, 2021 (4) KHC 13 (DB). PW6, the mother though denied the entire allegation ofmolestation, in cross-examination, stated that both her son and daughter informed her about the'incident'. Hence it cannot be said that the mother was unaware of the 'incident'; which can bereasonably inferred to be that alleged by the victim. PW7, the brother of the victim, again speaks ofhis sister having complained of their father having caught her ( ); which again is a clear innuendo ofa sexual advance as understood in the vernacular. He also informed the same to his mother andeldest sister. PW7 denied an allegation of sexual harassment having been informed to him but theinnuendo of what was complained of, as spoken of by himself, puts his denial in peril. PW7 alsodenied any quarrel with the father and also refused to toe the defence version of the victim having aclandestine relationship with the checker of the bus. Quite in contradistinction, PW6 spoke of herdaughter's relationship and the infuriated father having broken a mobile through which the victimmaintained contact with Biju.Narayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/615. Despite our finding that penile penetration is an after-thought and embellishment, concerningdigital penetration, the evidence of the prosecutrix is very clear. The hostile witnesses are closerelatives of the accused and the victim, all of the same family being parents and children. Themother and brother of the victim obviously wanted to save the father from punishment. The reactionof the mother at the first instance was not favourable to the victim; the daughter who was subjectedto molestation by her own father. The family first moved the victim from their residence anddiscontinued school; which also could be for the reason of the clandestine affair suggested by thevictim. But the defence did not get any support from PW7, the brother of the victim, who otherwisesupported the accused, his father. More pertinently, the defence did not think it fit to lead evidenceto establish the case set up by putting the eldest brother and sister in the box, one of whom wasmarried off and the other employed as an Accountant. The incident spoken of by the mother, PW6and the allegation of the victim against their father as spoken of by the brother, PW7, corroboratesthe victim's version of molestation having occurred but not to the extent of rape as defined undersection 375 IPC,16. There is an inconsistency concerning the time the victim spent in her elder sister's house, whichwe find to be not very significant insofar as the findings on the actual offence is concerned. The HMhad spoken of the child having not come to school from 27.11.2012 onward. The evidence of PW4regarding the sexual molestation and the communication of the same to her family members wouldhave caused some instability in the family. This would have also caused the family members of thevictim to keep her away from school and then shift her residence temporarily. It is only natural thatwhen such an incident is reported within the family, there is an attempt to sweep the entire matterunder the carpet to avoid humiliation, ostracization and the resultant ignominy. Obviously, truthcame out of the inner folds of the family, only when the child resumed studies and blurted out herexplanation for the continued absence, which absence was long enough to result in her expulsion.17. As was found a decade and a half back in Asha Ram (supra), it is very unlikely for a woman tomake a false allegation of rape, especially against her father. Even now we find the societal norms tobe identical and no girl would, by making such false allegations expose the entire family to shameand invite condemnation and ostracization of the society. There, the allegation was that theestranged mother had instigated the daughter, which was found to be a mere story set up, but notestablished. Here the mother and brother turned hostile; but portions of their evidence offeredcorroboration to the evidence of the victim. We find the evidence of the victim concerning sexualmolestation to be credible and convincing; short of penile penetration. We do not find any delay inlodging the FIR and the sequence of events as detailed by us provides a more than satisfactory andcompelling explanation for the delay in registration of the FIR. The delay if at all, occurred at thehands of the family, which is only natural and the crime came out when the victim spoke to anoutsider, the HM of her school, at the first instance when she resumed studies after a long absenceof about three months. Santosh Prasad @ Santosh Kumar (supra) has no application. Bhudeb Uchaiand Subhash (both supra) were cases in which the evidence of the victim was found to beinconsistent and uninspiring.18. We would now consider the argument raised by the State based on Ravi (supra). Even though theoffence here was committed before the amendments brought to the Protection of Children fromNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/7Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and also the IPC; in considering the sentencing of the accused, this courthas to keep in mind the latest legislative policy providing for harsher punishments in cases of suchdepravity, where 'protectors turn predators', is the forceful argument. By an amendment in 2019,the sentence for 'aggravated sexual assault', under the POCSO Act has been increased from ten totwenty years and imprisonment for life is expressly stated to be imprisonment for the remainder ofthe life of a person. Significant emphasis was made in the said decision, to the 'death sentence',which was also introduced, for an offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault interalia on achild below 12 years.19. Ravi (supra) was a case in which a toddler of two years was kidnapped and sexually assaulted forover 4 to 5 hours till she breathed her last. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering an appealfrom a death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court. In confirmingsuch a death sentence, the court noticed the amendments brought in by reason only of multiplyingincidents of child sexual abuse, indicating a prevalence of the inhuman mindset and barbaricapproach to young victims. The judicial precedents rendered before the recent amendment ought tobe viewed with a purposive approach so that the legislative policy and the judicial approach, are wellharmonized was the dictum. The learned Judges noticed Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2SCC 684 and Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab, (1983) 3 SCC 470, which laid down guidelines inimposing death sentence. Death sentence is permissible for the offence under Section 302 on whichalso the accused therein was charged under. Only since the deceased victim was a toddler of twoyears who was also sexually assaulted; the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to the subsequentamendments to find the offence of murder, in that case, to be the rarest of rare, warranting deathpenalty. If the murder was after the amendment, the age of the victim would have requiredconsideration of the death penalty and even before the amendment section 302 provided for thedeath penalty but only in the rarest of rare cases. The earlier decisions in Bachan Singh and MachhiSingh (both supra) according to the learned judges 'serve as the foundation stone of contemporarysentencing jurisprudence'(sic) which had to be harmonized with the legislative policy emanatingfrom the amendments providing more stringent and rigorous punishments; even of death.20. The said principle has no application here since in the cited decision death sentence was apunishment under Section 302 and for finding it to be the rarest of the rare; the multiplyinginstances of sexual assault against minor children was noticed; on account of which the legislaturetoo had enhanced the punishment for such offences. What the Prosecutor would have us do, in thiscase, where the conviction is under Section 377 IPC, is to impose the maximum punishment of lifeconsidering the amendments made to the POCSO Act, enhancing the punishment to 20 years or lifeand even death in cases where the child is below 12 years of age. The reasoning seems to be that, anidentical offence committed after the amendment, by a father on his daughter, a minor child, couldbe imposed with a death sentence under the POCSO Act. Foremost, here though the child is statedto be minor, there is no evidence, legally acceptable, as to the age of the victim. The accused wasacquitted of the charge under the provisions of the un-amended POCSO Act, for the reason of nocredible evidence being available as to the exact date of commission and definitely nothing to provesuch commission after the date on which that Act came into force. The charge that remains againstthe accused is only of Section 377 IPC. The punishment provided in the IPC, is of imprisonmentextending to ten years or life imprisonment. If we were to award life, then of course there is noNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/8quarrel for the Prosecutor. If we were to avoid life, then there could be nothing more than 10 years.But if we take into account the enhanced punishment of 20 years, then we have no option but toaward life; despite wiser counsel against that. Then we would be legislating and rendering otiose, thesentencing policy as reflected in the penalty provided for that offence. We do not find any suchproposition, as argued by the Prosecutor, emanating from the decision relied on. We also do not findany application of the dictum of the said decision in the facts of this case regarding the sentencepermissible on that count.21. On the findings above regarding the evidence, we find that the accused can be convicted onlyunder Section 377 IPC, which we do, affirming the conviction on that count entered by the trialCourt. We set aside the conviction under Section 376 IPC. Now we come to the aspect of sentencing.We are conscious of the fact that this is a case of the father having molested his daughter. Thelearned Counsel for the appellant pleads for leniency in the sentence and points out his advancingage; nearing his sixty's. The accused and PW6 have six children. The allegation was of repeatedmolestation, at the earlier rented residence where they had stayed for six months. On 12.02.2013when the FIS was recorded, it was also stated that the family had shifted residence just a monthback. Hence the offence would have been committed between June and December of 2012. BeforeCourt, PW4 said the period was between May and September of 2012; a slight diversion. But in chiefexamination itself, PW4 said that on the morning after the first day she was molested, she informedthe fact to her brother PW7, who spoke of it to their mother, PW6. She stopped going to school bythe end of November 2012; ie: from 27.11.2012 as deposed by the HM. There is an inconsistencyconcerning the period she spent at the marital home of her sister, away from her family. She says itwas only two weeks before Court, while in the FIS she says she was with her elder sister for threemonths. PW7 says that the victim went to the sister's house in October and came back in February.When the family was informed at the very first instance, the shifting of residence would have beenby way of a safeguard. We are convinced that the crime alleged was committed but not with theseverity and frequency projected. This raises a 'residual doubt' in our minds, which the Hon'bleSupreme Court has found to be a state of mind existing somewhere between 'beyond reasonabledoubt' and 'absolute certainty'. We respectfully rely on Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura, (2014) 4SCC 747.22.Ashok Debbarma (supra) was interalia considering the death sentence awarded to the appellantand the concept of 'residual doubt' was raised as a mitigating factor in the consideration of whetherthe case was one of the rarest of the rare kind. The concept originated in the United States and theCourt observed: "'Residual doubt' is a mitigating circumstance, sometimes used and urged beforethe jury in the United States and, generally, not found favour by the various courts in the UnitedStates"(sic). This is for the reason that having instructed the Jury to find the accused guilty beyondreasonable doubt, there cannot be a further instruction at the time of sentencing that the higherstandard of elimination of 'all doubts' should have been employed [Franklin v. Lynaugh 487 US 164(1988)]. Proof beyond reasonable doubt was expressed in the following words in Krishnan v. State,(2003) 7 SCC 56:"[d]oubts would be called reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstractspeculation. Law cannot afford any favourite other than truth. To constituteNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/9reasonable doubt, it must be free from an overemotional response. Doubts must beactual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from theevidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions. Areasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt, but a fairdoubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in thecase". (SCC p. 63, para 23) Ashok Debbarma spoke thus on these concepts : 'In ourcriminal justice system, for recording guilt of the accused, it is not necessary that theprosecution should prove the case with absolute or mathematical certainty, but onlybeyond reasonable doubt. Criminal courts, while examining whether any doubt isbeyond reasonable doubt, may carry in their mind, some "residual doubt", eventhough the courts are convinced of the accused persons' guilt beyond reasonabledoubt." (sic) The Court further elaborated on 'residual doubt' as per the followingextract:"33. In California v. Brown, 93 L Ed 2d 934: 479 US 538 (1987) and other cases, theUS courts took the view, "residual doubt" is not a fact about the defendant or thecircumstances of the crime, but a lingering uncertainty about facts, a state of mindthat exists somewhere between "beyond a reasonable doubt" and "absolutecertainty". The petitioner's "residual doubt" claim is that the States must permitcapital sentencing bodies to demand proof of guilt to "an absolute certainty" beforeimposing the death sentence. Nothing in our cases mandates the imposition of thisheightened burden of proof at capital sentencing.34. We also, in this country, as already indicated, expect the prosecution to prove itscase beyond a reasonable doubt, but not with "absolute certainty". But, in between"reasonable doubt" and "absolute certainty", a decision-maker's mind may wander,possibly in a given case he may go for "absolute certainty" so as to award deathsentence, short of that he may go for "beyond reasonable doubt". Suffice it to say, sofar as the present case is concerned, we entertained a lingering doubt as to whetherthe appellant alone could have executed the crime single- handedly, especially whenthe prosecution itself says that it was the handiwork of a large group of people. If thatbe so, in our view, the crime perpetrated by a group of people in an extremely brutal,grotesque and dastardly manner, could not have been thrown upon the appellantalone without charge-sheeting other groups of persons numbering around 35. All theelement test as well as the residual doubt test, in a given case, may favour theaccused, as a mitigating factor."23. We are quite conscious of the fact that the concept of 'residual doubt' wasreckoned by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decision as a mitigatingfactor to avoid death sentence. We would respectfully adopt the said concept, even inthe present case of rape as a mitigating factor in sentencing. As we observed, there isevidence of sexual molestation; but not with the severity and frequency as spoken ofby the prosecutrix. The family also has a different version and there is the compellingfactor of the prosecutrix having informed the family after the very first instance andNarayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/10the family having shifted her residence. These aspects give rise to the residual doubtsas spoken of by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and hence we are compelled to modifythe sentence. We think that the sentence can be modified to 10 years under Section377 of the I.P.C. while upholding the fine imposed by the trial court with a defaultsentence as ordered in the impugned judgment. The conviction and sentence underSection 376 of I.P.C. are reversed. The Criminal Appeal stands partly allowed.Sd/-K.Vinod Chandran, Judge Sd/-Ziyad Rahman A.A., Judge dkr/-Narayanan vs State Of Kerala on 8 September, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198259410/11
