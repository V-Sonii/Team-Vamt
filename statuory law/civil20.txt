That these incumbents joinedduty on various dates pursuant to respective orders of appointment issued by the competentCorporate Manager in respect of those Aided Colleges which are affiliated to the 4threspondent-University of Kerala.3. It is averred that the selection and appointment were pursuant to a selection conducted by theselection committee in full adherence to the provisions contained in the Kerala University Act andthe statutes and Ordinances framed thereunder. Ext.P-1 is the advertisement in respect of theselection notification issued by the College Management inviting applications for selection to theabove post in those Colleges from interested aspirants and Ext.P-2 dated 11.6.2013 is theproceedings of the Government nominating an Officer ::3::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 as Government nominee in the selection committee, which wasauthorised to conduct the selection process. The selection process was duly conducted and Ext.P-3 isthe minutes of the selection committee in respect of the selection of the petitioners concerned andthe said selection committee consists of nominee of the Management, nominee of the Government,subject expert and the Principal in terms of the provisions contained in the Act and the statutes.That in Ext.P-3, the 1st petitioner secured rank No.3 in open merit and the 2nd petitioner securedrank No.7 in community merit, the 3rd petitioner secured rank No.2 in community merit, the 4thpetitioner secured rank No.4 in the open merit and the 5th petitioner secured rank No.2 in the openmerit. That pursuant to Ext.P-3 selection process, the appointment orders have been issued in termsof Exts.P-4 to P-8 by the Corporate Manager of the Colleges concerned, who is the appointingauthority in terms of the provisions of the Act. Thereafter, contesting respondents 1 to 3 hadforwarded necessary proposal for securing approval of appointment of the petitioners. Thereafter, itis pointed out that competent authority of the 4th respondent-University, viz, the Syndicate hasconsidered the said proposal and granted statutory approval for the said appointment of the ::4::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 petitioners as evident from Ext.P-9 proceedings dated 10.8.2015issued by the University. Thereafter, the College authorities concerned had forwarded necessaryproposals to the 5th respondent-Deputy Director of Collegiate Education, Kollam, for necessaryaction for admissibility of salary of the petitioners in terms of the provisions of the direct paymentscheme which governs the field. Without deciding the matter, the 5th respondent in turn referredthe matter as per Ext.P-10 to the 7th respondent-State Government for their sanction. The 7threspondent- Government then sought for report from the 6th respondent-Director of CollegiateEducation as evident from Ext.P-11. In response to Ext.P-11, the 5th respondent-Deputy Directorinformed that the post can be sanctioned in Chemistry in N.S.S. Colleges, at Nilamel, Kottiyam andThiruvananthapuram, as evident from Ext.P-12. The Corporate Manager of the Colleges thensubmitted Ext.P-13 representation before the 6th respondent requesting to grant sanction for salaryand other benefits to the petitioners as their appointments are made against admissible posts inDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/5terms of the workload in the College, more so, in the light of the statutory approval granted by thecompetent University authority for the above said appointments. Further, the Manager ::5::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 clarified in the representation that not only sufficient workload isavailable in respondents 1-3 Colleges, but also that there us sufficient workload in the other Collegesunder the same management viz., M.G.College, Thiruvananthapuram, N.S.S.College, Kottiyam andN.S.S.College, Nilamel. It is averred that inspite of approval from the 4th respondent-University andclarification issued by the Management, the 5th respondent has not sanctioned salary till date for novalid reasons and that the procedure adopted by the State authority is totally against the provisionsof law contained in the Kerala University Act and subordinate legislations framed thereunder andfurther that the same is against catena of rulings of this Court and the Apex Court in the matter ofliability of the Government to disburse the salary of aided College teachers consequent to approvalof appointment by the University authorities concerned. It is in the light of these facts andcircumstances that the petitioners have instituted the instant writ petition with the followingprayers:"i. Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or directiondirecting the respondents no.5 to 7 to sanction and disburse salary to the petitionerswith arrears with effect from 12-12-2013, 09-06-2014, 19-12- 2013, 17-12-2013 and13-12-2013 respectively as per Ext.P9 within the time limit fixed by this Hon'bleCourt with arrears.::6::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 ii. Issue such other appropriate writ, order or direction as thisHon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case."4. The 5th respondent-Deputy Director of Collegiate Education has filed a statement dated19.3.2016 in this Writ Petition. The aspects regarding the appointments of the petitioners are not inany way disputed in that statement. The crucial aspect of the matter raised in para 3 reads asfollows:"3. It is submitted that the total workload of department in Chemistry inN.S.S.College Nilamel is 17 hours and the sanctioned post in one. At the times ofappointment of petitioner then two teachers were working including the petitioner.As per the post Adalath workload there is one sanctioned post in the department ofChemistry. As per the rank list prepared by the Selection Committee, Athira C.J(IIIrd rank holder) have not given approval by this office, since the appointment ismade in a non sanctioned post. In the case of Smt.Suprabha even though theappointment made in a sanctioned post at N.S.S.College, Nilamel, this office is not ina position to give concurrence due to non issuance of concurrence of seniorsappointed in non sanctioned post. At the time of the appointment of the 3rd and IVthpetitioner in VTMNSS College, Dhanuvachapuram there is sufficient workload andvacancy, seniors in the rank list have not been getting the approval. In the aboveDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/6circumstances the approval cannot be sanction to Dr.Sreenath .K andDr.Radheeshkumar V.K. The total workload of department in chemistry in MM NSSCollege, Kottiyam is 63 hours and the sanctioned post is 4. At the time of theappointment of the vth petitioner, five teachers were working including the petitionerand the Principal. As per the Post Adalath Workload there is 4 sanctioned posts in thedepartment of Chemistry."Further, it is stated in para 4 thereof that appointment of petitioners 1 & 5 as Assistant Professor inChemistry is in the surplus vacancy in N.S.S. College, Nilamel, M.M.College, Kottiyam, as per theexisting workload statement and that the 5th respondent-Deputy Director of Collegiate ::7::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 Education has referred the matter back to the 4threspondent-Kerala University and to the Government vide letter No.B2/8581/2015 dated20.11.2015. It is contended in para 5 thereof that the contention that once the appointment isapproved by the University, the Deputy Director is bound to sanction and disburse the salary is notapplicable in this particular case. That amendment to Sec.57(1) of the Kerala University Actprescribes the appointment of the post eligible to receive salary from the Government shall be madeonly against posts sanctioned by the Government or by such officers as may be authorised by theGovernment and that the petitioners 1 & 5 have been appointed in a non sanctioned post and so theGovernment is not liable to pay salary as per the above condition and that the 5th respondent isawaiting reply from the University and Government for taking final decision in this matter.5. Respondents 1 to 3 who are the Principals of the respective colleges concerned have filed separatecounter affidavits in the matter. It is reiterated in all those pleadings of the college authorities thatthe petitioners have been duly appointed in accordance with the statutory procedure prescribed inthe Act and the statutes and that they have ::8::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 been appointed only as against admissible post in terms of thestatutory recruitment norms prescribed by the statutory ordinances framed by the University andthat the appointments have been duly approved by the competent authorities of the University etc.However, it may be pertinent to refer to one crucial paragraph in each of those pleadings whichdeals with the facts situation of the workload in the respective colleges. Para 5 of the counter of R1reads as follows:-" The subject Chemistry is imparting in the College as a subsidiary subject for B.Sc(Bio- Chemistry) and B.Sc.(Zoology). The total teaching hours for chemistry in thecollege per week is 33. The total teaching hours for chemistry in the college per weekis 33.

They are Smt.G.S.Sreelatha, Sri.P.Sutharsanan nair, Smt.S.Rajalakshmi,and petitioners 3 and4. I have forwarded the details regarding appointment of petitioners 3 and 4 alongwith all documents to the 5th respondent and requested him to issue concurrence forclaiming salary of the petitioners 3 and 4."::9::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 Para 5 of the counter of R3 reads as follows:-"The subject Chemistry is imparting in the College for B.Sc (Polymer Chemistry) andas a subsidiary subject for B.Sc (Zoology) and B.Sc (Physics). The total teaching hoursfor chemistry in the college per week is 78. The college is entitled to get 05 teachingposts in the Department of Chemistry in the college.

I have forwarded the details regarding appointmentof 5th petitioner along with all documents to the 5th respondent and requested himto issue concurrence for claiming salary of the 5th petitioner."So the above said pleadings submitted by the contesting respondents 1 to 3 colleges clearly disclosesthe facts and figures regarding the teaching workload in the respective colleges concerned.6. The 4th respondent Kerala University has filed a counter affidavit dated 22.6.2016, the details ofthe appointments of each of the writ petitioners have been statutorily dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 6of the said counter affidavit. In para 7 thereof, it is stated by the 4th respondent that as per theworkload assessed by the Kerala University, there is a workload of 78 hours in the ChemistryDepartment of MM/NSS College, Kottiyam and therefore five teachers are permissible (i.e, 16 hoursfor one teacher ; 16 x 4 = 64 ; 78 hrs - 64 = 14 hrs) and that it may be noted that out of the balance 14hrs, five hours of the ::10::Dr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/8W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 workload has been allotted to the Principal since at the time ofthe appointment of the 5th petitioner, in the subject of Chemistry, the subject handled by theincumbent in the post of Principal also happened to be Chemistry. That hence, the balance workloadavailable is 9 hours against which, the 5th teacher can be appointed. In that regard it is pointed outby the learned Standing Counsel for the 4th respondent Kerala University that since the balanceworkload available is 9 hours in that college, an additional post is clearly admissible in terms of thestatutory norms prescribed in the ordinances framed under the University Act. It is thus pointed outthat the approvals of the appointments have been granted as per the resolution of the Syndicate heldon 6.6.2015. It is further pointed out in para 8 of the counter affidavit of the 4th respondent, that the5th respondent Deputy Director of College Education had forwarded Letter No.B2/8581/2015 dated20.11.2015, seeking clarification regarding the approval given to the appointment of the firstpetitioner as Assistant Professor, Chemistry in NSS College, Nilamel. That, in response thereof aclarification letter dated 8.1.2016 was sent in reply thereto wherein the clear details as to how theworkload calculated by the University was also explained. It is ::11::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 further stated therein that the workload in NSS College Nilamel,as per post Adalath Review-2002 is 17 hours and that there is an additional post permissible withthe workload of 9 hours in that college. That in G.O.(M.S.)No.260/2010/H.Edn dated 20.8.2010, itis seen that no additional post is sanctioned for Chemistry at NSS College, Nilamel and that it hascome to the notice of the University that several mistakes have been crept into the above mentionedG.O. dated 20.8.2010 and that as per the calculation of University of Kerala, there is a workload of39 hours and two posts are permissible in the Department of Chemistry at NSS College, Nilamel.Thus it is evident that the 4th respondent University has re-considered the matter based on therequest sought for clarification contained in the 5th respondent Deputy Director's letter dated20.11.2015 and intimation in that regard was given by the University to the 5th respondent as perletter dated 8.1.2016, pointing out that the stand of the Government and the department that noadditional post can be sanctioned for the NSS College, Nilamel based on G.O.(Ms.) dated 20.8.2010is wrong and that several mistakes have been crept into the above mentioned G.O and as per thecalculation of the 4th respondent University in terms of the statutory ordinance ::12::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 dealing with workload requirements there is indeed a workload of39 hours and two posts are permissible in the departments of Chemistry at NSS College Nilamel. Itis also reiterated in para 9 of the said counter affidavit that additional post are permissible if thereare periods above 8 hours. In this context it may also be relevant to note the contents of theaforementioned letter No.Ac.FII/50387/2015 dated 8.1.2016 send by the 4th respondent-Universityto the 5th respondent-Deputy Director of Collegiate Education, which reads as follows:       'No.Ac.FII/50387/2015                                              Thiruvananthapuram                                                                          Dated: 08-01-2016       From                The Registrar       ToDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/9                Deputy Director,                Directorate of Collegiate Education, Kollam.

Heard Sri.S.Muhammed Haneef, learned counsel for the writ petitioners, the learned GovernmentPleader appearing for the official respondents 5 to 7, Sri.Paul Jacob, learned Standing Counselappearing for the 4th respondent Kerala University and Sri.P.Gopal, learned Standing Counsel forthe College Management appearing on behalf of the respondents 1 to 3.8. The position that emerges based on the above said pleadings on record is that the petitioners havebeen appointed by the Corporate Manager of the colleges concerned and that their appointmentshave already been approved by the University. It is not in dispute that their appointments are madein strict adherence to the selection procedure prescribed as per the University Act and the statutes.The 4th respondent University would also clearly state in their pleadings that the petitioners havebeen indeed appointed as against post admissible in terms of the statutory ordinances regulating theworkload norms of teaching staff. The respondents 5 to 7 would contend that the appointments ofthe 1st and the 5th petitioners are against non-admissible post and that they had sought aclarification from the University after the grant of approval by the University and ::15::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 that those posts in question are not admissible going by the termsand conditions of the norms concerned etc. It is also now on record that the University reconsideredthe matter after the issuance of letter dated 20.11.2015 issued by the 5th respondent Deputy Directorof Collegiate Education seeking clarification as to how the approvals were given to the appointmentsin question and that after such consideration, the University has already communicated theirdecision as per their reply letter dated 8.1.2016, informing the Government department concernedthat the post is indeed admissible as per the workload norms prescribed by the statutory ordinancesconcerned.9. Hence, the crucial issue is as to whether the writ petitioners who are teaching staff are entitled fordisbursal of pay and allowances under the direct payment scheme of the State Government, in so faras, their appointments in question have been duly approved by the 4th respondent University and soDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/11far as University had even reconsidered the matter and had reiterated their decision to theGovernment Department that the post in question are indeed admissible going by the statutorynorms. To decide on this controversy, it may be pertinent to refer to the legal principles laid downby the rulings of this Court and ::16::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 the Apex Court on that aspect of the matter.10. A Division Bench of this Court in the case Cherian Mathew V. Principal S.B.College,Changanassery reported in 1998 (2) KLT 144 = [1998 (3) ILR Ker 1] has held that when a teacher isappointed in a college run by a private management affiliated to the University and aided by theGovernment, his/her salary is to be disbursed by the Governmental authorities concerned, approveupon statutory approval of that appointment by the competent authority of the Universityconcerned. It will be profitable to refer to para 6 of Cherian Mathew's case (supra) reported in 1998(2) KLT 144 . Para 6 of the said ruling reads as follows:-       "6.     xxx             xxx           xxx              xxx             xxx               xxx            xxx            xxx               xxx            xxxWhen a teacher is appointed in accordance with the work load assessed in the above terms, the saidappointment is to be honoured by the Director of Collegiate Education and salary disbursed, if thesaid appointment is approved by the University. In case the Director doubts the correctness of thatappointment, he will be at liberty to take up the matter with the University. When such a step isresorted to by the Director, the University has to examine the issue afresh and take a decisionthereon. The decision so taken by the University as seen from the provisions of the Ordinance,Statute and Act is binding on the Director. In such a situation, the Director will have no other coursethan to disburse the salary of the teacher whose appointment is approved by the University."::17::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 201611. The above said judgment in Cherian Mathew's Case (supra) was rendered on 25.3.1996 inO.P.No.33 of 1996 and connected cases. Later, an amendment was enacted as per State Act 2 of2005 published in Kerala Gazette extraordinary no. 524 dated 9.3.2005, with effect from 6.1.2005and the provisions contained in Section 57 (1) read as follows:-"Sec.57. Appointment of teachers in private colleges.-(1) Appointments to the postseligible to receive salary from the Government shall be made only against postssanctioned by the Government or by such officers as may be authorised by theGovernment."12. Therefore, subsequently certain objections were raised by the Governmental authoritiesconcerned that so long as the post to which the appointments of the private aided affiliated collegeDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/12teacher is not sanctioned either by the Government or by such officers as may be authorized by theGovernment on that behalf as envisaged in the amended provision of Section 57 (1), suchappointment are not liable for approval. The contention based on those amended provisions wasconsidered in detail by a Division Bench of this Court in the case Shalini Rachel V. Manager,Christian College reported in 2007 (3) KLT 355, after exhaustively considering the variousprovisions contained in the University Act, the provisions in the first statutes, first ordinances etc,::18::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 the Division Bench noted therein that the said provisions in thestatute make it clear that every appointment made to the teaching staff should get approval of theUniversity and that Statute 14 (3) says that in the case of private colleges coming under the directpayment scheme, the Director of Collegiate Education or the officer authorized by him in this regardshall verify in consultation with the University as to whether the teaching post in the private collegesare in excess of the post sanctioned by the University and that the expression "post sanctioned bythe University" needs emphasis. The power is statutorily conferred on the Syndicate and theUniversity to approve the appointment if it is in accordance with the staff pattern fixed by theUniversity and that the persons who are appointed should be fully qualified to hold the post. Statute14 (2) authorized the Deputy Director of Collegiate Education to verify before making directpayment of salaries as to whether the post for which the payment is made is in accordance with thestaff pattern and workload fixed by the University. Accordingly, it was held that it is for theSyndicate of the University to sanction a post and grant approval to appointment to the said post inaccordance with the workload and staff pattern and once the University grants approval for fillingup the ::19::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 post sanctioned, on the basis of workload and staff pattern, theGovernment shall have the obligation to disburse the salary under the direct payment scheme.Therefore, it is held that power is hence conferred on the Syndicate of the University to sanction thepost and approve the same and the Deputy Director of Collegiate Education is to verify whether theapproval/sanction of the post is in accordance with the staff pattern and workload norms of theUniversity and in doubtful cases, it can take up the matter with the University. Very crucially in para11 thereof, the Division Bench held in Shalini Rachael's Case (supra) that Section 57 (1) only saysthat appointment to post eligible to seats already from the Government shall be made only aftergetting prior sanction from Government or such other officers authorized by the Government andthat for filling up the post sanctioned by the University on the basis of workload or staff pattern, noprior permission of the Government is necessary. That, once the Syndicate of the University grantsapproval for filling up the existing vacancies, depending upon the workload and staff pattern, theGovernment is then obliged to pay salary to the teachers appointed by duly constituted SelectionCommittee and if the Government or its officers finds that the ::20::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 approval is granted by the University illegally, it can always takeup the matter before the University or other forums so that public interest will not suffer. Verycrucially, it was held by the Division Bench that Section 57 (1) was introduced not to take away thestatutory powers already conferred on the Syndicate of the University and that the principles laiddown by the Division Bench in its earlier rulings in Cherian Mathew's case (supra) still holds good.Dr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/13In that view of the matter, their Lordships of the Division Bench had affirmed the impugneddirections of the learned single Judge, rendered therein directing the disbursal of the salaries by theGovernment Department in the light of the approval secured for such appointments from theUniversity. It would be pertinent to refer to paragraphs 10 to 11 of Shalini Rachael's case (supra)(See KLT report) which reads as follows:-"10. Scope of S.57 (2) of the Kerala University Act has to be tested in the light of theabove mentioned statutory provisions. Pwer of the University in granting approval aswell as sanctioning posts after ascertaining the work load and fixation of staff patternas per the Statutes has not been taken away by the University Amendment Act 2 of2005. Clear cut provisions have been made in the University Statutes and Ordinancesas to how the work load has to be assessed and staff strength fixed so as to avoidunnecessary appointments. Further the interest of the students is also to besafeguarded by apponiting sufficient number of teachers without delay. Power is alsoconferred on the Deputy Director of Collegiate Education to take up the matter withthe University in case there is any doubt with the approval granted. In appropriatecases, Government can also examine the ::21::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 action taken by the Deputy Director and address the Universitythrough him.11. We have no reason to think that an august body like Syndicate or the Deputy Director ofCollegiate Edication would act arbitrarily or against public interest while exercising powersstatutorily conferred on them. Sub-s (1) of S.57 only says that appointments to the posts eligible toreceive salary from the Government shall be made only after getting prior sanction from or fromsuch officers authorised by the Government. For filling up the posts sanctioned by the University onthe basis of work load or staff pattern, no prior permission of the Government is necessary. OnceSyndicate of the University grants approval for filling up the existing vacancies depending uppon theworkload and staff pattern Government is obliged to pay salary of the teachers appointed by dulyconstituted Selection Committee. If Government or its officers find that the approval was granted bythe University illegally it can always take up the matter before the University or other forums so thatpublic interest will not suffer. S.57 (1) was introduced not to take away the statuory powers alreadyconferred on the Syndicate of the University. Principle laid down in Cherina Mathew's case, supra inour view, still holds good. In view of the above mentioned circumstances, we are inclined to affirmthe judgment of the learned single Judge in W.P.(C).No.12109 of 2006 and dismiss W.A.No.940 of2007."13. A more compex issue came up for consideration before the Division Bench of this Court in thecase State of Kerala v. Arun George reported in 2009 (4) KLT 972 wherein the specific questionraised therein was as to whether when there is direct payment agreement in respect of aidedcourses, whether the State Government can fix unilateral conditions such as absolving itself fromfinancial commitments for sanctioning of new courses. It was held that in paras 22 and 23 thereof,that Government and the University had accepted ::22::Dr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/14W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 the courses additionally sanctioned in existing aided affiliatedcollege as aided courses, those authorities that bound to reckon the additional workload andconsider the proposal of the college for approval of the appointments made in respect of theworkloads flowing out from such additional sanctioned posts in aided colleges, having due regard tothe provisions contained in Statute 16 of Chapter 45 of the University Statutes and that theGovernment is thereupon obliged to pay the salary and other benefits to such teachers who areappointed as against post which are admissible in terms of the workload that arise out of suchadditional aided posts sanctioned in those colleges and that Government cannot evade from suchresponsibility merely by saying that a unilateral condition was fixed by them while santioning thoseadiditonal posts that there will be no obligation for the Government to remove financial obligationfrom the Government to run such additional courses in aided colleges etc. The above said judgmentof the Division bench of this Court in Arun George's case (supra) was taken up in SLP and civilappeal proceedings before the Apex Court and the Apex Court had affirmed the view of the Divisionbench in the case State of Kerala V.Arun George reported in 2015 (1) KLT 833 (SC) . Their Lordshipsof ::23::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 the Apex Court held therein that so long as there is an agreementfor direct payment system between the State Government and the private affiliated aided collegesconcerned and so long as the Management has not violated the terms of the direct payment system,the Governmental Authorities concerned are obligated to disburse the pay and other benefits toteachers appointed by such aided colleges if they have been duly appointed by following theprescribed procedure of selection through the Statutory Selection Committee and so long as suchappointments are made to post which are admissible based on the workload norms which eminatefrom the running of such additional posts in the colleges concerned.14. Hence, a scanning of the above said major rulings of this Court and the Apex Court, would makeit clear like the daylight that if the Management has adhered to the statutory selection procedure,and if the post is admissible based on the statutory workload norms of the University prescribed asper the statutory ordinances and if such appointments have been duly approved, by the competentAuthority of the University concerned, then the Governmental authorities concerned are obliged todisburse pay and allowances and all such other benefits ::24::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 to such teachers appointed in aided affiliated colleges. But, if theGovernmental Authorities concerned have any reservation or doubts as to the correctness orotherwise, of the statutory approval granted by the University authorities, then they are empoweredin law to refer the matter to the University for re-consideration and if the University retains itsdecison, then the appointees concerned are entitled for salary and other benefits based on the directpayment system that governs the field. In the instant case, the pleadings of the University clearlydisclose that they are fully convinced in granting approval to the appointments of the petitioners asthose appointments were made to the post which are admissible in terms of the workloadprescribtions as per the statutory ordinances framed under the Kerala University Act. Before partingwith this case, it is to be noted that there is slight divergence in the stand taken by the respondentUniversity and the respondent colleges concerned as to the extra post admissible based on thebalance teaching hours available and as to the total workload in NSS College, Nilamel. TheDr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/15respondent colleges concerned have stated that extra post is available, if balance teaching hours ismore than 6hours and that this is the prescription that governs the field based on the statutory ::25::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 workload and that the same has not been amended till now. Thelearned Standing Counsel for the Kerala University would submit that the Syndicate of the KeralaUniversity has now taken a subsequent decision on 6.6.2015 that more than 8 hours should beavailable for the admissibility of the additional posts. In this regard, it is also pointed out by therespondent colleges that the decision if any, taken by the Syndicate later have not fructified in thestatutory amendment as per the due process prescribed in the Kerala University Act. On anothercount, the respondent college would state that the total workload in NSS College, Nilamel (to whichpetitioners 1 and 2 have been appointed) is only 33 hours whereas, the counter affidavit of 4threspondent University states that the total workload in that college is actually 39 hours. Irrespectiveas to whether the balance teaching hours required is more than 6 hours as stated by the College or 8hours as stated by the University or whether the total workload in NSS College, Nilamel is 33 hoursas contended by the College or 39 hours stated by the University, makes no difference as far as theappointments of the petiitoner herein are concerned and as regards the liability of the governmentalauthorities concerned to disburse the salary, in the facts of this case.::26::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 Therefore, this Court need not go into these aspects.15. The upshot of the above discussion is that the respondents 5 to 7 are obliged to disburse pay andallowances and all other benefits due to the petitioners consequent on the approval of theirappointments by the 4th respondent University. Accordingly, the competent authority amongrespondents 1 to 3 and respondents 5 and 6 will ensure that all necessary formalities for clearance ofpay and allowances to the petitioners are competed without much delay and the competentauthority among respondents 5 to 7 will ensure that the current pay and allowances admissible tothe petitioners for the periods in question shall be disbursed without much delay, at any rate, withina period of two months from the date of production of a certified copy of this judgment and thearrears of pay and allowances envisible to the petitioners shall be paid without much delay, at anyrate, within an outer time limit of four months from the date of production of a certified copy of thisjudgment.W.P.(C).No.12726 of 201616. The facts in this case are broadly similar and identical to those in W.P.(C).No.5116 of 2016, inwhich, the judgment was ::27::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 already rendered by this Court today.17. The petitioner herein, was appointed as Assistant Professor in the Commerce Department of the5th respondent Nehru Arts and Science College, Kanhangad by Ext.P-2 dated 12.2.2013 consequentto the selection process conducted by the Statutory Selection Committee as per Ext.P-1 proceedings.Dr.Athira C.J vs PrincipalIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52135971/16The above said appointment of the petitioner as per Ext.P-2 has been duly approved by the 4threspondent Kannur University as per Ext.P-3 proceedings dated 22.10.2013. Thereafter, necessaryproposal was submitted to the Government Department Authorities concerned for necessary actionfor disbursal of pay and allowances to the petitioner. By Ext.P-4 letter dated 1.10.2015, the firstrespondent Government had expressed doubt regarding the correctness of the approval granted tothe above said appointment and this has been duly intimated to the 4th respondent University.Thereupon, the 4th respondent University has re-considered the matter and has reiterated its standagain as per Ext.P-5 that the approval of the petitioner granted by the University is in order and totreat the appointment as regular for the purpose of disbursal of salary and other benefits and thisposition is confirmed by the learned Standing Counsel for the 4th respondent ::28::W.P(C).Nos.5116 & 12726 Of 2016 Kannur University . It is further averred that still then, therespondents 1 to 3 had refused to pay salary and other benefits to the petitioner. The petitionerrelied on the rulings in Cherian Mathew v. Principal, S.B.College reported in [1998 (2) KLT 144],Shalini Rachel v. Manager reported in [2007 (3) KLT 355] etc.,to urge that the respondents 1 to 3are obliged to disburse pay and allowances and other benefits to the petitioner in the light of thestatutory approval granted to his appointment by the 4th respondent Kannur University. It is in thelight of these aspects, the petitioner has preferred the instant writ petition (civil) with the followingprayers:-"i) Issue a writ of mandamus or writ of similar nature or order or direction, directingthe respondents to ratify the appointment of the petitioner as Asst. Professor in theDepartment of Commerce in Nehru Arts and Science College, Kanhangad with effectfrom 13.2.2013 and to sanction and to disburse the arrears of salary from 13.2.2013onwards forthwith;ii) Issue a writ of mandamus or writ of similar nature or order or direction,commanding the respondents No.1 to 3 to sanction and disburse the salary to thepetitioner with arrears from 13.2.2013 forthwith;iii) Such other reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts andcircumstances of the case."18.

On a consideration of the matter, this Court is of the considered opinion that the matter in issueis covered by the aforesaid Division Bench rulings and that this writ petition can also be disposed ofin the light of the judgment in W.P.(C).No.5116 of 2016.
