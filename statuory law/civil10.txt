COLABAWALLA, J.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/1Reserved on : 18th March, 2021.Pronounced on : 16th March, 2022.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx J U D G E M E N T :-1. At the outset, I must mention that arguments in the above matter were concluded on 18th March2021 and parties had also tendered detailed written submissions. However, due to the third wave ofthe COVID-19 pandemic and also other exigencies of work, there was a delay in pronouncingjudgment in the above matter. I had, therefore, placed the matter on Board today (i.e. 16th March2022) at 2:30 pm in chambers under the caption "FOR DIRECTION/PRONOUNCEMENT OFJUDGEMENT". I did this because almost a year has elapsed since the judgment was reserved, and Iwanted to inquire from the parties if they wanted to make any further submissions. In thesecircumstances, I asked Mr. Chinoy, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner,as well as Mr. Dada, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, if theywanted to make any further submissions or whether I should proceed to pronounce judgment in theabove matter. Both counsels stated before me that notwithstanding the delay, they do not want tomake any further submissions and I should proceed for pronouncing the judgment. Accordingly, Ihave pronounced the judgment today.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx2. The above Petition is filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (forshort "the Arbitration Act") seeking to set aside the Majority Award of the Arbitral Tribunal dated13th July 2020. The Majority Award is passed by Mrs. Justice Sujata Manohar (Retd.), a formerJudge of the Supreme Court of India and Dr. Justice Mukundakam Sharma (Retd.), also a formerJudge of the Supreme Court. The dissenting Award dated 20th July 2020 is given by a former Judgeof the Supreme Court of India, Mr. Justice S. S. Nijjar (Retd).3. By the Majority Award, the Petitioner's challenge to the Respondent's rescission of the Petitioner's2nd Media Rights License Agreement dated 25th March 2009 (for short, the "2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA") was rejected. Under the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA, the Petitioner was granted Media Rightsin relation to the Indian Premier League (for short the "IPL") for the "Rest of the World" ("RoW")territories (i.e. all territories other than the Indian Sub-Continent), for the period 2009- 2017. In theMajority Award, the Arbitrators upheld that the said rescission of the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA byaccepting the Respondent's contention that the said MRLA was part of a fraudulent compositetransaction. Since the said MRLA was part of a composite fraud, the Respondent's rescission of thesaid MRLA was upheld by the Majority Award.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx4. Before I advert to the facts of the case, it would be necessary to set out the description of theparties. The Petitioner, World Sports Group (India) Private Limited (for short "WSGI") is acompany incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. It was part of the WorldWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/2Sports Group of companies which was subsequently acquired by the Lagardere Group which isengaged in the business of sports marketing, event management and media rights, specifically inrelation to cricket, golf, and football. The Respondent, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (forshort "BCCI") is a society registered under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Registration of SocietiesAct, 1975 and is the governing body for the sport of cricket in India. In fact, BCCI organizes cricketmatches in India and abroad. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer to the Petitioner as "WSGI"and the Respondent as "BCCI".5. The facts to be noted to decide the present controversy are this. In September 2007, BCCIconceptualized and decided to launch the Indian Premier League (for short the "IPL") which was thefirst of its kind, franchise-based, 20-over cricket tournament. The format of the IPL differed fromthe then existing structure of either the 5-day TEST MATCHES or the ONE-DAY INTERNATIONALMATCHES. The IPL was carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx to be administered by a sub-committee ofBCCI known as the IPL Governing Council. Mr. Lalit Kumar Modi was appointed as the Chairman ofthe IPL Governing Council. To facilitate all this, a Memorandum of Understanding dated 13thSeptember 2007 was executed between BCCI and the International Management Group (UK) Ltd.("IMG") to provide specialist Media Rights services to BCCI inter alia in relation to negotiation,review, and execution of contracts for the IPL.6. On 30th November 2007, BCCI floated an invitation to tender inviting bids from broadcastersand/or media marketing agencies to acquire a license for the IPL Media Rights for a period of 10years starting from 2008 to 2017. The tender contemplated IPL Media Rights(i) for the Indian Sub-Continent (consisting of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal,Bhutan, and the Maldives) and (ii) for the "Rest of the World" (for short "RoW") territories.7. Pursuant to the aforesaid tender, WSGI bid for and was awarded the contract for the GlobalMedia Rights Package of the IPL for a period of 10 years (2008-2017) for the approximate value ofUSD One Billion. Since WSGI (the Petitioner/Claimant) was not a broadcaster but only a trader inMedia Rights, it entered into pre-bid negotiations with carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx MSM Satellite(Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (for short "MSM") which had a broadcasting network in India. Though theClaimant/WSGI was the only successful bidder for the IPL Global Media Rights Package for theentire period (2008-2017), MSM, for its own commercial reasons, instead of entering into asub-licensing Agreement with WSGI, desired to enter into a direct Media Rights License Agreement(MRLA) with BCCI for the Indian Sub-Continent (hereinafter referred to as the "India Rights") forthe period 2008-2012. To facilitate this process, MSM, with the consent of WSGI, entered into aMedia Rights License Agreement dated 21st January 2008 with BCCI (for short the "1st BCCI-MSMMRLA") for the period 2008-2012 for USD275.40 Million. This 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA was only forthe India Rights for the period 2008-2012.8. On the same day i.e., 21st January 2008, a composite Media Rights License Agreement was alsoexecuted between BCCI and WSGI (for short the "1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA") for (i) the India Rightsfor the period 2013-2017 for a sum of USD 550 Million (Approximately Rs.2,200 crores); and (ii)the RoW Media Rights (i.e. excluding India Rights) for the period 2008-2017 for USD 92 Million.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/3Accordingly, the aggregate amount receivable by BCCI for the India Rights for the period 2008-2017was USD 824.50 Million (USD 274.50 Million from MSM + USD 550 Million from WSGI) whichwas equivalent to Rs.3301.60 crores. In carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx addition to this, an amount ofUSD 92 Million was also payable by WSGI to BCCI for the RoW rights.9. Since MSM had only acquired India Rights for the period 2008-2012, an Option Agreement dated21st January 2008 was also entered into between WSGI and MSM whereunder MSM was given theoption to acquire the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 from WSGI by making a payment of asum of up to USD 60 Million to WSGI. This was in addition to the License Fee of USD 550 Millionwhich was payable to BCCI by WSGI under the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA. For the sake of convenience,all the aforesaid agreements are hereinafter collectively referred to as "the MRLAs of 2008". TheMRLAs of 2008 are unquestioned and neither party has challenged the validity of theseAgreements.10. The first season of the IPL was conducted between April and May of 2008 and was a resoundingsuccess. After the first season of the IPL, disputes arose between BCCI and MSM which lead to BCCIterminating the 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA (which was for the India Rights for the period 2008-2012) on14th March 2009. Being aggrieved by this termination, MSM filed a petition in this Court underSection 9 of the Arbitration Act and sought interim relief against BCCI from acting on thecarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx aforesaid termination. The aforesaid Section 9 Petition was slated to beheard on 15th March 2009.11. Since BCCI had terminated the 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA on 14th March 2009, BCCI becameentitled to re-auction the India Rights for the period 2009-2012. However, given the resoundingsuccess of the IPL, BCCI wanted to substantially increase the License Fee receivable for the IndiaRights not only for the period 2009-2012 but also for the period 2013-2017 (which belonged toWSGI under the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008). In other words, BCCI wasdesirous of re- auctioning and concluding a new Media Rights Agreement for the India Rights forthe entire period of 2009-2017 as a single package.12. To take this further, BCCI requested WSGI to agree to a mutual termination of WSGI'sComposite Media Rights License Agreement dated 21st January 2008 (the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA)so that BCCI could unbundle the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 and aggregate the same withthe India Rights for the period 2009-2012 and then re-auction them as a single package for asubstantially higher amount. To achieve this objective, BBCI would enter into a fresh MRLA withWSGI or its affiliate World Sport Group (Mauritius) Limited (for short "WSGM"), granting it theIndia Rights for the period 2009-2017.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Additionally, BCCI would also enter into a fresh MRLA with WSGI forthe RoW rights for the period 2009-2017. It is not in dispute that at that relevant time (i.e. in March2009), there were no disputes whatsoever between BCCI and WSGI regarding the MRLAs of 2008.13. According to WSGI, it agreed to a mutual termination of the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21stJanuary 2008 only in order to enable BCCI to receive an enhanced License Fee for the India RightsWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/4for the period 2009-2017 on the condition (i) that the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 wouldbe licensed to WSGI, or its nominee - WSGM, thereby enabling WSGI to realize a premium forrelinquishment of its India Rights for the period 2013-2017; and (ii) that BCCI would reinstateWSGI's RoW Rights for the period 2009-2017 by entering into a fresh MRLA with WSGI on thesame terms and conditions as was recorded in the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008.14. To facilitate this entire process, BCCI, WSGI and WSGM entered into a Deed of Mutually AgreedTermination dated 15th March 2009 (for short the "DMAT"). On the same date, i.e. 15th March2009, BCCI also entered into an Media Rights Licensing Agreement (MRLA) with WSGM forlicensing/ sub-licensing the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 for a substantially increased sumof Rs.4791.89 crores (for carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx short the "BCCI-WSGM MRLA"). Both theaforesaid Agreements were entered into at 3 AM on 15th March 2009. It is to be noted that the IndiaRights for the period 2009-2017 under the MRLAs of 2008, were licensed for a consideration ofRs.3,000 crores. In other words, BCCI licensed the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 for anadditional sum of Rs.1791 crores. One of the terms of this MRLA was that WSGM was required toenter into a sub-license Agreement with a broadcaster within 72 hours. Since BCCI and WSGM hadentered into the BCCI-WSGM MRLA on 15th March 2009, an affidavit was filed by Mr. Lalit Modion behalf of BCCI in the Section 9 Petition (filed by MSM before this Court) stating that an MRLAwas already executed between WSGM and BCCI on 15th March 2009. In this light, arguments wereheard by this Court in MSM's Section 9 Petition and was reserved for orders.15. According to WSGI, in view of the pending Court litigation, the 72-hour period as prescribed bythe BCCI-WSGM MRLA was extended first till 21st March 2009 and then till 24th March 2009. TheBombay High Court passed an order in MSM's Section 9 Petition on 23rd March 2009. By the saidorder, this Court refused interim reliefs to MSM inter alia on the basis that the India Rights of theIPL for the period 2009- 2017 had already been granted to WSGM under the BCCI-WSGM MRLAdated 15th March 2009.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx16. Since WSGM was not a broadcaster but only a trader in Media Rights, according to WSGI,between 15th March 2009 and 19th March 2009, WSGM was approached by MSM and several otherbroadcasters who were desirous of securing the India Rights for the period 2009-2017. For securingthe India Rights for the period 2009- 2017, MSM (i) was willing to match the amount payable byWSGM to BCCI under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA (i.e. pay Rs.4791 crores to BCCI for the period2009-2017); and (ii) since MSM was insistent on a direct agreement with BCCI and not as asub-licensee of WSGM, it was also willing to pay an additional amount of Rs.425 crores to WSGMfor giving up its India Rights.17. According to WSGI, to facilitate the aforesaid arrangement, it was agreed between WSGM, MSMand BCCI that WSGM would allow its rights under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009to lapse and BCCI would thereafter enter into a direct MRLA with MSM for the India Rights for theentire period of 2009-2017 on the same terms i.e. by paying BCCI Rs.4791 crores. In additionthereto, MSM would pay WSGM an additional fee/premium of Rs.425 crores under a separateWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/5Agreement. Accordingly, and to facilitate this entire arrangement, the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated15th March 2009 was allowed to lapse and a letter dated 25th carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx March2009 was executed by WSGM and BCCI confirming that the BCCI- WSGM MRLA had lapsed on25th March 2009. This gave way for MSM to enter into a MRLA directly with BCCI for the IndiaRights for the period 2009-2017. Accordingly, on 25th March 2009, MSM entered into a directagreement with BCCI for the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 for an amount of Rs.4791.89crores (for short the "2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA"). On the same day (i.e. 25th March 2009), WSGM andMSM also executed a "Deed for Provision of Facilitation Services" (for short the "Facilitation Deed")which inter alia recorded that WSGM had assisted MSM in finalising the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA andthat MSM had agreed to pay a Facilitation Fee of Rs.425 crores to WSGM in return for suchFacilitation Services. It is the case of WSGI that though the BCCI- WSGM MRLA is dated 15thMarch 2009, inadvertently the same was referred to as being dated 23rd March 2009 in theFacilitation Deed. Be that as it may, under this entire arrangement, BCCI received an additionalamount of Rs.1791 crores for the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 i.e. Rs.4791 crores minusRs.3000 crores [for the same period under the MRLAs of 2008].18. In order to restore/reinstate WSGI's RoW rights and which were given to it under the 1stBCCI-WSGI MRLA, BCCI also executed a fresh/2nd Media Rights License Agreement with WSGI on25th March carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx 2009 for the RoW rights for the period 2009-2017 w. e. f.15th March 2009 (for short the "2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA"). This MRLA had the same terms andconditions as stipulated in the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008 save and except thatthe 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA contained Clause 27.5 which inter alia stipulated that upon BCCIreceiving a notice regarding the non-payment of the Facilitation Fee Amount from MSM, BCCIwould either terminate the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA or pay the amount owed by MSM to WSGM.19. It is the case of the WSGI that the arrangement set out above and all the Agreements enteredinto in 2009 (to give effect to the above arrangement), were all prepared by Paul Manning of IMG.To put it in a nutshell, it is the case of WSGI that the aforesaid arrangement, which culminated intoall the Agreements executed in 2009:(i) enabled BCCI to re-auction the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 for anincreased License Fee of Rs.4791 crores in comparison to the original License Fee ofRs.3000 crores (i.e. an increase of Rs.1791 crores). BCCI was able to get thisincreased amount by re-auctioning the India Rights for the entire period of2009-2017 only because WSGI agreed to the termination of its 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLAand thereby giving up its India Rights for the period 2013-2017 to BCCI as recordedin the DMAT;carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx(ii) WSGI, who was entitled to the India Rights for the period 2013-2017,relinquished the same to BCCI under the DMAT only to enable BCCI to re-auctionthe same by clubbing it with the India Rights for the period 2009-2012 whichaccrued to BCCI pursuant to the termination notice issued by BCCI to MSM on 14thWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/6March 2009. This relinquishment was subject to BBCI entering into a fresh MRLAwith WSGI or its affiliate - WSGM, granting it the India Rights for the period2009-2017; and(iii) WSGI's RoW Media Rights for the period 2009-2017 were restored andreinstated w.e.f. 15th March 2009 on the same terms and conditions as the 1stBCCI-WSGI MRLA, with the exception of insertion of Clause 27.5, which inter aliastipulated that upon BCCI receiving a notice regarding non- payment of theFacilitation Fee amount by MSM, BCCI will either terminate the 2nd BCCI-MSMMRLA or pay the amount owed by MSM.20. According to WSGI, during the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the IPL (i.e. the IPL held in 2009 &2010), all parties acted on the Agreements entered into in 2009. In other words, MSM dealt with theIndia Rights and agreed to pay the enhanced License Fee of Rs.4791 crores to BCCI while WSGIdealt with the RoW rights. According to WSGI, during the course of the 3rd season of the IPL, therewere reports of disputes between Mr. Lalit Modi and other office bearers of the BCCI. As there weremedia carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx reports alleging irregularities over the acquisition of MediaRights from BCCI, MSM, on 23rd April 2010, issued a press statement about the circumstances inwhich it had entered into the contract for payment of the Facilitation Fee to WSGM. The aforesaidpress release inter alia stated:(i) MSM's intent to secure the India Rights from WSGM, who had acquired saidRights under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009;(ii) that MSM had been insistent on getting a direct contract with BCCI rather than asub-license from WSGM who had these rights under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated15th March 2009; and(iii) the Facilitation Fee of Rs.425 crores was payable to WSGM for giving up its IndiaRights under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009.21. Be that as it may, according to WSGI, on 25th June 2010, MSM, acting contrary to the aforesaidpress statement and at the instance of BCCI, issued an Advocate's Notice to WSGM purporting torescind the Facilitation Deed on the ground that WSGM had falsely represented that WSGM hadexecuted an Agreement dated 23rd March 2009 with BCCI whereunder WSGM had been grantedunfettered Global Media Rights, including the India Rights and that the said rights were subsistingwith carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx WSGM at the time of execution of the Facilitation Deed on 25thMarch 2009. According to WSGI, MSM at the instance of BCCI, sought to take wrongful advantageof the fact that the Facilitation Deed had inadvertently / erroneously referred to the BCCI-WSGMMRLA as being dated 23rd March 2009 instead of 15th March 2009. According to WSGI, MSM'ssaid allegations were ex-facie contrary to and belied by its own press statement dated 23rd April2010 which referred only to the BCCI- WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009 and made absolutelyno reference to any alleged MRLA dated 23rd March 2009.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/722. Be that as it may, on 25th June 2010, a further Agreement was entered into between BCCI andMSM amending the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA dated 25th March 2009. This Agreement inter aliadeleted Clause 10.4 of the said 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA which stipulated that upon BCCI receiving anotice from WSGM for non-payment of the Facilitation Fee, BCCI would terminate the 2ndBCCI-MSM MRLA.23. Thereafter, on 28th June 2010, BCCI issued a notice to WSGI alleging that the 2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA dated 25th March 2009 (and which related only to the RoW rights for 2009-2017) was on theface of it vitiated by fraud since the Facilitation Fee of Rs.425 crores payable to WSGM wereamounts actually due to BCCI. In these circumstances, BCCI carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx purportedto rescind the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA "due to the all-pervasive fraud that you have perpetrated onthe BCCI".24. The allegations made by BCCI, through its termination notice dated 28th June 2010, wereresponded to by WSGI vide its letter dated 30th June 2010. Thereafter, WSGI filed a Section 9Petition seeking interim relief against BCCI's termination of the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA. A learnedSingle Judge of this Court rejected the said Section 9 Petition on 20th December 2010. Beingaggrieved by the aforesaid rejection, an Appeal was filed before a Division Bench of this Court. TheDivision Bench in Appeal, by order dated 23rd February 2011, allowed the Appeal and restrainedBCCI from creating any third-party rights in relation to the Media Rights for the RoW ("Rest of theWorld").25. Being aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench, BCCI preferred an SLP before the Hon'bleSupreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, by its order dated 21st April 2011, disposed of the SLPfiled by BCCI by giving the following directions:"(a) BCCI shall be entitled to award any of the unawarded sub- licence media rights(to which respondent was entitled under the agreement dated 25.3.2009), byfollowing the standard tender procedures. BCCI will be entitled to take all decisions,and do all acts, that could have been taken or done by the respondent under theagreement dated 25.3.2009, if it had been operational.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx(b) All amounts/deposits/licence fees received by BCCI as consideration in respect ofsub-licence or by the agreements entered by the respondent, or by the BCCI after thetermination, shall be remitted to an Escrow Account with a Nationalized Bank.(c) Out of the amounts so remitted to the Escrow Account, BCCI shall be entitled todraw every year, an amount equivalent to the license fee it would have received fromthe respondent under the agreement dated 25.3.2009 (if the said agreement had notbeen terminated), without prejudice to its rights and contentions.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/8(d) The net annual income (that is the difference between the total of amountsremitted to the Escrow Account every year less the amount equivalent to the licencefee that is drawn by BCCI in terms of agreement dated 25.3.2009) shall be kept in afixed deposit for a term of one year. Such fixed deposits shall be renewed yearly tillthe final adjudication of the disputes between the respondent and the appellant by acompetent court or arbitral tribunal (if the remedy of arbitration is available oragreed) as the case may be.(e) BCCI shall file yearly accounts (after furnishing a copy thereof to the respondent)in regard to the amounts received, the amount remitted to the Escrow Account,amounts drawn by BCCI (equivalent to the licence fee under the agreement dated25.3.2009) and the net amount invested in fixed deposits.(f) In regard to the amounts to be received and accounted for by BCCI as aforesaid,the BCCI shall be deemed to be a Receiver appointed by this Court. Such deemedReceivership will end automatically, on final decision by the Court/Tribunal beforewhich the disputes are raised, or on 31.1.2017, whichever is earlier."26. Thereafter, arbitration commenced between the parties and WSGI filed its Statement of Claimbefore the Arbitral Tribunal on 7th June 2016. On 13th July 2016 BCCI filed its Statement ofDefence. Thereafter, carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx and on 22nd February 2017, BCCI filed itsamended Statement of Defence incorporating the ground that the arbitration was not maintainablein the absence of proper and necessary parties being WSGM and Mr Lalit Kumar Modi. WSGI filedits additional Rejoinder on 16 March 2017. Thereafter, the matter went to trial and the impugnedMajority Award dated 13th July 2020 was passed and which is challenged in the present Petition.WSGI's SUBMISSIONS:27. In this factual backdrop, Mr. Chinoy, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of WSGI,submitted that the Majority Award is ex-facie perverse and vitiated by patent illegality in as much asit totally fails to advert to or consider the crucial undisputed fact / evidence that BCCI was able toreceive from MSM an increased License Fee of Rs.4791 crores for the India Rights for the periodfrom 2009-2017 by virtue of the Agreements entered into between BCCI, WSGI, WSGM and MSMin the year 2009. Mr. Chinoy submitted that pursuant to all the Agreements entered into betweenthe period 15th March 2009 to 25th March 2009 (including the DMAT), WSGI, relinquished itsIndia Rights for the period from 2013-2017 to BCCI so as to enable BCCI to aggregate these rightswith the India Rights for 2009-2012 (which reverted to BCCI pursuant to the termination of the 1stBCCI-MSM MRLA dated 21st January 2008), carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx and thenre-sell/re-auction the India Rights for the entire period of 2009- 2017 (as a single package) for asubstantially higher License Fee. Mr. Chinoy submitted that failure of the Tribunal to note thisenormous benefit/gain which had inured to BCCI as a consequence of the aforesaid Agreementsentered into between 15th March 2009 and 25th March 2009 (the composite transaction) wasmaterial because:World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/9(i) as a result of having received and retained this enormous monetary benefit, BCCIhad necessarily approbated and affirmed the said composite transaction (i.e. theAgreements entered into between 15th March 2009 and 25th March 2009) and wastherefore, in law, precluded from rescinding or reprobating any part thereof,including the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009, and which was in relation to the Media Rightsfor the RoW; and(ii) this has led the Tribunal to come to a perverse conclusion that the object of thecomposite transaction was only to enable the alleged diversion of Rs.425 crores toWSGM. It completely overlooked the fact that by the composite transaction, BCCIwas able to receive and retain a much higher License Fee of Rs.4791 crorescarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx for the period 2009-2017.28. Mr. Chinoy took me through the Majority Award and pointed out that in the entire Award, thereis not a single reference to the fact that by the aforesaid composite transaction, BCCI had in-factbenefited to the extent of Rs. 1791 crores. He submitted that this composite transaction, resulting inBCCI receiving the benefit of Rs.1791 crores and which BCCI had retained, had been specificallyaverred/stated in the Statement of Claim and not been disputed/denied by BCCI in thereply/Written Statement of BCCI, and more particularly, paragraph 55 (qq) thereof. Mr. Chinoysubmitted that BCCI had gained and retained the benefit of an increase in the License Fee of Rs.1791 crores because of the composite transaction entered into between BCCI, MSM, WSGM andWSGI respectively. This being the case, BCCI was precluded from impugning / rescinding any partof the composite transaction (i.e. all the Agreements entered into in the year 2009). Despite havingurged this argument specifically before the Tribunal and which is reflected in the post hearingsubmissions, the Arbitral Tribunal in its Majority Award, has failed to consider the aforesaidargument which would go to the root of the matter. In this regard, Mr. Chinoy brought to myattention pages 460, 463, 465, 467, 485, 486 and 536 of the paper book which relate to post hearingsubmissions of WSGI. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the fact carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx that BCCIreceived and retained this benefit of Rs. 1791 crores and consequently having approbated/affirmedthe composite transaction is also noted in the Minority Award. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the onlyreason he refers to the Minority Award is to show to the Court that the aforesaid argument wasspecifically put in issue before the Tribunal and the Majority Award completely overlooks thisargument and has not even been considered. It is this conduct of the Majority Tribunal that Mr.Chinoy terms as ex-facie perverse and vitiated by patent illegality.29. Mr. Chinoy then submitted that WSGI's argument on perversity is further reinforced when onereads the Arbitrators' findings on the purpose/object of the DMAT. He submitted that the saidfindings are ex-facie contrary to the express terms of the DMAT. In this regard, Mr. Chinoysubmitted that while the increased License Fee of Rs. 4791 crores was undoubtedly due to theincreased popularity of the IPL after the 1st season of the IPL in 2008, BCCI would not have beenable to secure such increased License Fees for the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 withoutWSGI agreeing to surrender their India Rights for the aforesaid period to BCCI under the DMAT. ItWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/10is the DMAT that enabled BCCI to re- sell/re-auction the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 as acomplete package. Mr. Chinoy, therefore, submitted that the Majority Award is liable to be set asideon the ground of patent illegality and perversity for carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx totally failing toadvert to and consider the facts and evidence that under the composite transaction (and moreparticularly the DMAT), BCCI was able to re-sell the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 to MSMfor an enhanced License Fee of Rs.4791 crores and which sum BCCI had retained and enjoyed thebenefit thereof. Mr. Chinoy submitted that if this fact had been considered, it would necessarily leadto the conclusion / consequence that receipt and enjoyment of the said enhanced sum of Rs.4791crores clearly constituted approbation on the part of BCCI which, in turn, precluded BCCI fromreprobating / rescinding the composite transaction (i.e. the Agreements entered into in 2009) orany part thereof, including the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009.30. The next argument canvassed by Mr. Chinoy was that the Award is perverse as it contravenes theprinciples of Sections 64 and 65 of the Contract Act, 1872, and is therefore, contrary to thefundamental policy of Indian Law. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Majority Award upholds therescission of the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009, without requiring BCCI toterminate the other Agreements, and in particular, the DMAT. Consequently, the Majority Awarddoes not require BCCI to restore the benefit it had received under all the Agreements executed in2009 including the DMAT. In this regard, Mr. Chinoy submitted that BCCI has only purported torescind the 2nd BCCI-carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 and had not terminated/rescindedthe other Agreements executed in 2009, including the DMAT. This is despite the fact that it isBCCI's own case that all the Agreements from 15th March 2009 to 25th March 2009, (including theDMAT) formed part of a fraudulent composite transaction. Mr. Chinoy submitted that in law, BCCIcould not have rescinded only the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 withoutrescinding / cancelling all the other Agreements which formed part of the so called fraudulentcomposite transaction, including the DMAT. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the reason why the otherAgreements were not terminated is not far to see. He submitted that BCCI did not terminate theother Agreements, including the DMAT, as that would have resulted in requiring BCCI to restore thebenefits it had received thereunder i.e. it would have had to restore to WSGI (i) the India Rights forthe period 2013-2017; and (ii) the RoW rights for the period 2009-2017. This would necessarilyrequire BCCI to give up the increase in the License Fee of Rs.1160 crores which it had received fromMSM for the India Rights for the period 2013-2017. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the rescission of onlythe 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 and not of the DMAT and other Agreementsexecuted in 2009 (which formed part of the composite transaction), is ex-facie impermissible andinvalid in law. By purporting to rescind only the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA and not the DMAT, BCCIhas sought to defeat/nullify the statutory obligation to carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx return thebenefit/advantage it had received under the DMAT i.e. the India Rights for the period 2013-2017and the RoW Rights for the period 2009-2017.31. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Majority Award, by upholding the termination of only the 2ndBCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 (despite BCCI's own case that it formed part of thefraudulent composite transaction, including the DMAT), in effect enabled BCCI to negate/bypass itsWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/11statutory obligation to restore the benefit/advantage it had received under the DMAT. Mr. Chinoysubmitted that such a purported partial rescission of the composite transaction has resulted inunjust enrichment and is contrary to the principle of Section 64 of the Contract Act, 1872 whichembodies the fundamental policy of Indian Law. The Award which upholds such an illegal partialrescission, results in unjust enrichment contrary to the principles embodied in Sections 64 and 65 ofthe Contract Act, 1872 and is accordingly illegal, perverse, and contrary to the fundamental policy ofIndian Law. Mr. Chinoy clarified that WSGI was not seeking restoration / restitution of the benefit /advantage received by the BCCI under Sections 64 and 65 of the Contract Act, 1872. He submittedthat it is WSGI's submission that the purported rescission was bad in law as BCCI had notterminated the other Agreements, including the DMAT, and had carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx therebysought to bypass/negate the statutory obligation which would have arisen on termination of theDMAT which was to return the advantage/ benefit it had received under such Agreements, includingthe DMAT.32. Mr. Chinoy brought to my attention that it was the submission of BCCI before the Tribunal thatthe termination of the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 had the effect ofrescinding/repudiating all the Agreements that formed part of the composite transaction, includingthe Deed of Mutually Agreed termination (DMAT), and therefore, no separate rescission of theDMAT was required or warranted. The Award, however, holds that there was no need to rescind theother Agreements (forming part of the alleged fraudulent composite transaction) because by thetime BCCI discovered the fraud, all these Agreements were determined by the efflux of time. Mr.Chinoy submitted that the finding in the Majority Award that there was no need to rescind the otherAgreements (forming part of the alleged fraudulent transaction) as "...all these Agreements weredetermined by efflux of time by the time the Respondent discovered the fraud and, therefore, therewas no requirement for the BCCI to rescind the other Agreements", is ex-facie perverse. Mr. Chinoysubmitted that BCCI was carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx able to re-sell/re-auction the India Rights forthe period 2009-2017 to MSM at a higher price of Rs.4791 crores only because WSGI had, under theDMAT, agreed to surrender/revert its India Rights for the period 2013-2017 to BCCI. BCCI acted onthe basis of that surrender and re- licensed the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 to MSM. Thisbeing the factual position, Mr. Chinoy submitted that there was no question of the DMAT having"determined by efflux of time". If the composite transaction was fraudulent, the DMAT (whichformed a part thereof) would also be required to be rescinded and on such rescission, BCCI wouldhave statutorily been required to return to WSGI the benefit it had received thereunder i.e. the IndiaRights for the period 2013-2017 as well as the RoW Rights for the period 2009-2017. He, therefore,submitted that the Award is also perverse and suffers from a patent illegality on this ground as well.33. Mr. Chinoy thereafter submitted that the Majority Award also deserves to be set aside becausethe Arbitrator's interpretation of the DMAT and its stated purpose and object is clearly contrary tothe express terms/plain language thereof, and is therefore, ex-facie perverse and is not even thepossible view. In this regard, Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Majority Award holds that WSGI'scontention that the DMAT was executed to unbundle the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 so asto carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx make its subsequent aggregation with the India Rights for the period2009-2012 possible (which would get BCCI more money), does not appear to be convincing. Mr.Chinoy submitted that the Majority Award also holds that there is no reference to the unbundling ofWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/12the India Rights by WSGI in the order to enhance its value when sold as an entire package for theperiod 2009-2017. He submitted that the Award further goes on to hold that by the DMAT, theWSGI agreed to give up its India Rights for the period 2013-2017 in favour of WSGM for noconsideration. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the aforesaid observations and findings in the Awardregarding the DMAT, are contrary to the express terms thereof.34. To substantiate this argument, Mr. Chinoy took me through recitals (D) and (E) of the DMAT aswell as the definition of the term "New WSG Media Rights Agreements" as well as Clauses 2.1 and2.2 thereof. Relying upon the aforesaid clauses, Mr. Chinoy submitted that the DMAT makes itclear: (a) that BCCI, which now held the India Rights for the period 2009-2012 (pursuant totermination of MSMs 1st BCCI- MSM MRLA dated 21st January 2008), had requested WSGI toagree to a Mutual Termination of its composite MRLA (the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21stJanuary 2008) which encapsulated the RoW rights for the period 2008-2017 and the India Rightsfor the period 2013-2017; (b) on this Mutual Termination, WSGI's India Rights for the period2013-2017 carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx would revert to BCCI; (c) this arrangement would enableBCCI to re- sell/re-auction the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 as a single package and receivea higher License Fee; (d) BCCI would license the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 to WSGM(an affiliate of WSGI) who could sub-license these rights to a broadcaster for a premium; and(e) BCCI would restore to WSGI the RoW rights for the period 2009-2017 on the same terms as the1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008 (in so far as it related to the RoW Rights).35. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the execution of the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009between BCCI and WSGM for the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 at the increased fee ofRs.4791 crores was in pursuance of the DMAT and was clearly only a means for BCCI to recover theincreased License Fee amount and to enable WSGM to recover a premium from a broadcaster,through sub-licensing of the India Rights. When one reads the terms of the DMAT, Mr. Chinoysubmitted that the Majority Award's decision that the object of the DMAT was for WSGI to assign itsIndia Rights to its affiliate WSGM, is ex-facie perverse and would mean that WSGI gave up itsvaluable India Rights for the period 2013-2017 to BCCI, only in order to receive the same rights backthrough its affiliate WSGM with payment of an additional License Fee of Rs. 1160 crores. Hesubmitted that this interpretation is wholly perverse carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx also from the pointof view that there is absolutely no explanation in the Majority Award as to why WSGI would give upits valuable rights for the period 2013-2017 only to get it back through its affiliate by paying anadditional amount of Rs.1160 crores. He, therefore, submitted that on this ground also theimpugned Award cannot stand and must be set aside.36. Mr. Chinoy then submitted that the Majority Award is also ex-facie arbitrary, capricious,perverse and contrary to the basic notions of justice and morality, in as much as it resulted in BCCIreceiving and enjoying the benefit of an increase in the License Fee of Rs.1791 crores for the IndiaRights for the period 2009-2017 and at the same time upholding BCCI's claim that Rs.425 crorespayable to WSGM for relinquishing and/or giving up its India Rights for the period 2009-2017 wasfraudulent and belonged to BCCI. Mr. Chinoy submitted that as a consequence, the Award upholdsBCCI's rescission of the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 under which WSGI got theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/13RoW rights for the period 2009- 2017. Mr. Chinoy submitted that this effectively means that BCCIwhilst receiving the aforesaid benefit of Rs. 1791 crores has deprived WSGI of all the rights it hadunder the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA, and all the benefits that come to it under the DMAT.37. In this regard, Mr. Chinoy submitted that initially WSGI had carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx theIndia Rights for the period 2013-2017 as well as the RoW Rights for the period 2008-2017 under the1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA. Admittedly, there were no disputes/issues between BCCI and WSGI quathese rights/MRLA's in 2009. It was on BCCI's request that WSGI agreed to a Mutual Terminationof the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA so as to enable BCCI to re-sell/re-auction the India Rights for theperiod 2009-2017 as a package for a higher License Fee only on the basis that it would be givenback/restored its RoW rights for the period 2009-2017 and would be compensated for giving up itsIndia Rights for the period 2013-2017 by permitting its affiliate WSGM to sub-license the same andreceive a premium thereunder. By virtue of these arrangements, BCCI was able to license the IndiaRights for the period 2009-2017 to MSM for Rs.4791 crores i.e. an increase of Rs. 1791 crores.However, whilst receiving and retaining such an enormous benefit of Rs.1791 crores, BCCI hasthereafter purported to deprive WSGM of Rs.425 crores it had to receive as compensation (termedas the Facilitation Fee) for the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 and has also deprived WSGI ofits RoW rights for the period 2009-2017. An Award which upholds this action of BCCI as legal, isex-facie contrary to the basic notions of justice and morality, and therefore, ought to be set aside.38. Lastly, Mr. Chinoy submitted that the finding in the Majority carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Awardthat the fraud as alleged by BCCI is established beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore can be avalid ground for rescinding the 2nd BCCI- WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009, is vitiated byperversity and patent illegality in as much as it is based on the Tribunal's perverse/ impossible viewof the DMAT and by the Tribunal's total failure to consider material evidence/facts i.e. the MSMPress Note/statement dated 23rd April 2010. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Press Note issued byMSM and who according to BCCI was not part of the alleged fraud, clearly states that the entireIndia Rights transaction was done after negotiations and with WSGM relinquishing its rights. Mr.Chinoy submitted that this would be a very important aspect that ought to have been considered bythe Tribunal before giving any finding on fraud being established beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr.Chinoy submitted that this Press Release/Note again relates to the India Rights whereas the subjectmatter of the present arbitration was the RoW rights. He brought to my attention the fact that BCCIobjected to WSGI's reliance on the aforesaid Press Note as not being proved during the crossexamination of RW-4 but the same was not accepted by the Tribunal. Mr. Chinoy submitted that thefinding of fraud rendered by the Tribunal because of the alleged diversion of Rs.425 crores is basedon the Arbitrator's perverse interpretation and misreading of the DMAT and their total failure toconsider MSM's Press Note. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Award totally fails to consider the PressNote carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx issued by MSM and which in fact establishes that WSGM's rightsunder the BCCI-WSGM MRLA has not merely lapsed or come to an end simplicitor on 25th March2009 as contended by BCCI and accepted by the Arbitrators in the Majority Award. It was only tofacilitate MSM's insistence/condition for a direct contract/license for the India Rights with BCCI(instead of a sub-license from WSGM), that WSGM relinquished its India Rights / agreed to give upits India Rights in favour of MSM by letting the BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009 lapse.This enabled MSM to enter into a direct contract / license with BCCI. In consideration of this, MSMWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/14agreed to pay WSGM a Facilitation Fee which was quantified at Rs. 425 crores. This Facilitation Feewas the premium that MSM would have to otherwise pay to WSGM if it had taken a sub- licensefrom WSGM for the India Rights. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the Award however only refers to thefact that WSGM's rights came to an end on 24th March 2009 and on that basis holds that there wasa fraud/diversion of Rs.425 crores. This finding is rendered without considering the aforesaidcircumstances set out by MSM in its Press Note which establishes that WSGM relinquished its IndiaRights/let them lapse so that on 25th March 2009 MSM could enter into a direct contract/licensewith BCCI, and as a part of this arrangement, MSM agreed to pay WSGM a premium as aFacilitation Fee.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx39. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the total perversity of the finding of diversion/fraud as reflected inthe Majority Award is that it results in the absurd consequence that:(i) WSGM simplicitor gave up/abandoned the valuable India Rights for the period2009-2017 (for which as recorded in MSM's Press Note there were "intensecommercial negotiations with other broadcasters also expressing interest, making thesituation extremely competitive") without seeking to recover anypremium/consideration for the same; and(ii) WSGI gave up its valuable India Rights for the period 2013-2017 for which it would have otherwise received a premium of upto USD 60 millionfrom MSM under the 2008 Option Deed.40. Mr. Chinoy submitted that the finding of fraud in the Majority Award regardingthe diversion of Rs.425 crores, completely ignores the commercial purpose, objectand terms of the DMAT, and is therefore, vitiated by perversity and patent illegalityin as much as it is based on the Tribunal's perverse/impossible view of the DMATand by the Tribunal's total failure to consider material evidence/facts i.e. MSM'scarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Press Note. For all the aforesaid reasons, Mr. Chinoysubmitted that the Majority Award is unsustainable and must be set aside.BCCI's SUBMISSIONS:41. On the other hand, Mr. Dada, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of BCCI, submittedthat from the averments in the Petition as well as the arguments canvassed by Mr. Chinoy, it wasclear that WSGI's challenge to the Majority Award is nothing else but to seek(i) a review of the merits of the dispute; (ii) re-appreciation of the evidence; and (iii) substitution ofan alternate view in place of the view taken by the Tribunal in the Majority Award.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/1542. Mr. Dada submitted that WSGI has extensively relied upon the "minority/dissenting opinion"issued by a member of the Arbitral Tribunal, presumably in a misguided attempt to present analternate view of the dispute. Similarly, WSGI has recanvassed arguments that were advancedbefore the Arbitral Tribunal which were considered and rejected in the Majority Award. Mr. Dadasubmitted that none of the grounds canvassed by WSGI fall within the purview of Section 34 of theArbitration Act (as amended in 2015). Mr. Dada submitted that it is now well settled that in anychallenge to an Award, re-appreciation of evidence is impermissible in Section 34 proceedings.Similarly, a mere carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself,is no longer a ground available to set aside an Arbitral Award. Mr. Dada submitted that even theconstruction of the terms of a contract is primarily for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide, and the samecannot be interfered with by this Court under Section 34, unless the Arbitral Tribunal construes thecontract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would. In other words, Mr. Dadasubmitted that it is only when the Arbitrator's view is such that no other prudent person would havetaken such a view, would this Court interfere under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Mr. Dadasubmitted that this Court under Section 34 cannot undertake an independent assessment of themerits of the dispute. The Tribunal is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence tobe relied upon whilst delivering the Arbitral Award. Even if the Award is based on little evidence oron evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind, would not be held to beinvalid. To put it in a nutshell, Mr. Dada submitted that it is now well settled that the scope ofjudicial scrutiny under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act (as amended in 2015) is very limited.Re-appreciation of evidence or reinterpretation of the contract is impermissible. No interferencewith the Award is warranted if the view taken by the Tribunal is a plausible view.43. Without prejudice to the aforesaid arguments, Mr. Dada carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx submittedthat WSGI has alleged that its actions in relinquishing its India Rights for the period 2013-2017 (byexecuting the DMAT) and bundling it with the India Rights for the period 2009-2012, enabled BCCIto an increase in the License Fee to the tune of Rs.1791 crores. Mr. Dada submitted that WSGIcontends that this was a material fact, and the Award is perverse as it does not consider this fact.Mr. Dada submitted that this submission is factually incorrect. He submitted that the Tribunal hasconsidered and rejected the self-serving arguments of WSGI and detailed observations and findingsin this regard are contained in the Majority Award, and more particularly, paragraphs 35 to 37thereof. In these circumstances, Mr. Dada submitted by no stretch of the imagination, the Awardcan be termed as perverse.44. Mr. Dada submitted that even otherwise, the allegations of WSGI are false as it is apparent froma perusal of the DMAT that WSGI agreed to give up its India Rights for the period 2013-2017(acquired under the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008) so as to facilitate theacquisition of the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 by WSGM. Mr. Dada further submitted thatthe Arbitral Tribunal in its Majority Award has also rightly held that from a perusal of the recitals ofthe DMAT, it is clear that the Petitioner agreed to the termination of the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA tounbundle the India Rights for the period 2013-carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx 2017 in order to facilitate the acquisition of the India Rights for theperiod from 2009-2017 by WSGM. Mr. Dada submitted that upon the execution of the BCCI-WSGMWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/16MRLA, whereunder the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 were granted to WSGM, WSGIadmittedly received its consideration under the DMAT. At this stage, the DMAT was sublimated intothe BCCI-WSGM MRLA. However, since the BCCI-WSGM MRLA lapsed on WSGM's failure tocomply with its obligations thereunder [being its obligation (a) to make an upfront payment of INR112.5 crores on the signing of the MRLA; (b) to provide a bank guarantee of INR 335 crores within 7days of the MRLA; and (c) to find a sub-licensing partner within 72 hours of the signing of theMRLA], all rights under the BCCI- WSGM MRLA reverted to BCCI. Mr. Dada pointed out that noconsequences are spelt out in the DMAT for what would happen if the BCCI-WSGM MRLA executedpursuant to the DMAT were to subsequently lapse. Mr. Dada submitted that any enhancement inthe License Fee payable to BCCI under the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA was not on account of WSGIreleasing any rights. Mr. Dada submitted that the enhancement was inter alia on account oftermination of the 1st BCCI- MSM MRLA on 14th March 2009 and the increased popularity of theIPL in the year 2009. Mr. Dada submitted that the value of such enhancement would go to the rightsholder i.e. BCCI, since after the said termination it was open for BCCI to auction the said rights inthe market. Mr. Dada carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx submitted that WSGM had agreed to pay anadditional sum of Rs. 1791 crores to BCCI, but never paid the same. Ultimately, MSM agreed to paythis additional amount of Rs.1791 crores to BCCI. Therefore, the increase in value was not relatableto any acts of WSGI. In this regard, it is also pertinent to note that under the 2nd BCCI-MSMMRLA, MSM was granted 600 seconds of additional commercial advertising time per match whichwas not available under the 1st BCCI WSGI MRLA and the 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA. Mr. Dadasubmitted that the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA was terminated by the parties and replaced by a newmedia rights agreement executed between BCCI and MSM dated 28th June 2010 (for short the "3rdBCCI-MSM MRLA"). This was an entirely new agreement, arrived at after fresh negotiations. It wasunder the 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA that BCCI received the amount of Rs.4791 crores, post discovery ofthe fraud. In fact, MSM also agreed to pay BCCI an additional amount of Rs.300 crores towards theIndia Rights for the period 2010-2017 under the 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA. Over and above this, MSMalso agreed to pay an amount of Rs.125 crores, if the same was recovered from the WSGM. Mr. Dadasubmitted that the License Fee for the India Rights was the specific subject matter of negotiationsbetween BCCI and MSM. Pursuant to these negotiations, MSM agreed to fresh payment terms,subject to BCCI fulfilling certain additional requests put forth by MSM. Mr. Dada submitted that,therefore, there was a proposal by BCCI, a counter-carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx proposal by MSM and acceptance thereafter by BCCI. In support of thisargument, Mr. Dada relied upon the correspondence exchanged between MSM and BCCI, namely,two letters both dated 2nd June 2010, one addressed by MSM to BCCI and the other by BCCI toMSM respectively, and a letter dated 24th June 2010 addressed by MSM to BCCI.45. Mr. Dada submitted that the submission of WSGI that the 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA was only anamendment to the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA is totally misconceived and baseless. Mr. Dada submittedthat BCCI and MSM renegotiated the License Fee for the India Rights. Thus, the enhanced fees werea direct result of the fresh negotiations and new terms agreed upon with respect to the License Feefor the period 2010- 2017. Mr. Dada submitted that the 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA also contains an"Entire Agreement" clause and a "No Reliance Clause". Mr. Dada submitted that when one reads the3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA, it is quite clear that it superseded and replaced the earlier MRLA and theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/17earlier understanding. When one looks at it from this angle, post discovery of the fraud, theenhanced India Rights Fees were thus received under the 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA, and not under the2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA. Mr. Dada submitted that it is not BCCI's case that the 3rd BCCI-MSMMRLA formed a part of the fraudulent composite transaction. The 3rd BCCI-MSM MRLA wassuccessfully performed and has now determined by the efflux of time.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx The monies received by BCCI thereunder, thus, cannot be termed as abenefit from the fraud. Mr. Dada, therefore, submitted that the view taken by the Tribunal in theMajority Award is correct or is, at the very least, a plausible view, and therefore, there is no merit inthis ground of challenge canvassed by WSGI.46. Whether the alleged benefit/advantage received by BCCI is a material piece of evidence, thenon-consideration of which would render the Majority Award perverse, Mr. Dada submitted that theTribunal has in fact considered WSGI's argument regarding the alleged benefit/ advantage receivedby BCCI at paragraph 35 of the Majority Award. Mr. Dada submitted that in any event, as statedearlier, there was no benefit or advantage that BCCI had received. As explained earlier, theenhanced fee that BCCI received was not relatable to any acts of the WSGI. Further, WSGM not onlybreached the BCCI-WSGM MRLA but also committed a fraud on MSM and BCCI by executing theFacilitation Deed. He, therefore, submitted that it was totally incorrect on the part of WSGI tocontend that the alleged benefit/advantage received by BCCI was a material piece of evidence,non-consideration of which rendered the Majority Award perverse. Mr. Dada, therefore, submittedthat there was no merit in the argument of WSGI that the Arbitral Tribunal failed to advert to orconsider that BCCI was able to receive from MSM an carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx increased LicenseFee of Rs.4791 crores for the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 because WSGI had relinquishedits India Rights for the period 2013-2017 to BCCI.47. Mr. Dada then submitted that even the argument of Mr. Chinoy that the Majority Award isperverse and contravenes the principles of Sections 64 and 65 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, andis therefore, contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law, is without any merit. Mr. Dadasubmitted that there is no prayer and/or pleading in the Statement of Claim filed before theTribunal for "restoration" of any alleged benefit under Sections 64 and 65 of the Indian ContractAct, 1872. Mr. Dada submitted that at no point in time, did WSGI quantify its purported entitlementunder Section 65 and/or demand a refund of a specified amount towards the benefit (purportedlyreceived by the BCCI from WSGI) under the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA. In the absence of the same, theTribunal could not have granted any relief under Sections 64 & 65 of the Contract Act to WSGI. Mr.Dada submitted that under Sections 64 and 65: (a) the alleged benefit is required to have beenreceived by BCCI under the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA itself & which admittedly is not the case; and (b)what is sought to be restored must be an advance payment or benefit already conferred under the2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx48. Mr. Dada then submitted that in any event, Sections 64 and 65 of the Contract Act will not aidWSGI since admittedly it had been found to have committed the fraud. Mr. Dada submitted thatWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/18WSGI was found to have been complicit in the fraudulent transaction. As such, there was noquestion of WSGI being returned any rights it had lost under the DMAT. The whole reason for therescission was that WSGI was involved in playing a fraud on BCCI. If any rights of WSGI arerestored, it would defeat the entire purpose and effect of the rescission, was the submission. Mr.Dada submitted that this argument has been dealt with by the Tribunal in paragraph 66 of theMajority Award wherein the Tribunal holds that no relief is claimed for restoration of any advantagereceived by BCCI as mentioned in Section 65 of the Contract Act, and there is no pleading orevidence led to that effect. The Tribunal has further recorded that there was no oral argument onthis issue, as well. The Tribunal, therefore, holds that this contention cannot be raised at this stage.Mr. Dada pointed out that the Tribunal further goes on to hold that nothing is stated throughout theproceeding as to the nature of the advantage received by BCCI. Mr. Dada, therefore, submitted thatthere is no merit in the arguments canvassed by WSGI that the Majority Award is perverse andcontravenes the principles of Sections 64 and 65 of the Contract Act and which is contrary to thefundamental policy of the Indian Law.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx49. Mr. Dada thereafter submitted that WSGI is completely incorrect when it contends that theArbitrator's interpretation of the DMAT and its stated purpose and object is contrary to the expressterms/plain language thereof. In this regard, Mr. Dada submitted that under the 1st BCCI-WSGIMRLA dated 21st January 2008, WSGI had the RoW rights for the period 2008-2017 along with theIndia Rights for the period 2013-2017. Even after the execution of the DMAT and the 2ndBCCI-WSGI MRLA, WSGI continued to have the RoW Rights for the period 2009-2017. What WSGIgave up was the India Rights for the period 2013-2017. Clearly, therefore, looking at the transactionas a whole, the RoW Rights were not WSGI's consideration for anything at all because WSGI alwayshad those rights. The consideration was clearly the diversion of the India Rights of WSGI to WSGM.Clearly, therefore, retention of the RoW Rights was not the WSGI's consideration for the DMAT. Theconsideration for the DMAT was the diversion of WSGI's India Rights to WSGM. Mr. Dadasubmitted that this is exactly what the Tribunal has held at Paragraphs 35 to 37 of the Award. Mr.Dada submitted that this consideration (diversion of the India Rights to WSGM) was received byWSGI when the BCCI-WSGM MRLA was executed on 15th March 2009. BCCI's alleged obligationsunder the DMAT were thus fulfilled on the execution of the BCCI-WSGM MRLA. To put it in anutshell, Mr. Dada submitted that:-carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx(a) The WSGI's consideration for the DMAT was the diversion of the India Rights forthe period 2009-2017 to its affiliate WSGM;(b) WSGI did not surrender the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 to BCCIabsolutely. The DMAT itself contemplated reversion of the India Rights for the period2013-2017 to the BCCI for the limited purpose of enabling the BCCI to sign theBCCI-WSGM-MRLA, and it is for this reason that WSGM was party to the DMAT;World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/19(c) This consideration was received by the WSGI when the BCCI-WSGM MRLA wasexecuted on 15th March 2009 and MSM succeeded in its arbitration against WSGM,and the amounts paid under the Facilitation Deed have been directed to be returnedto MSM and which has absolutely nothing to do with BCCI.50. Mr. Dada, therefore, submitted that BCCI cannot be held liable for anything when the WSGIalready received its consideration under the DMAT. Mr. Dada submitted that the DMAT havingbeen performed, had come to an end. Nothing remained for BCCI to perform or rescind. Mr. Dadasubmitted that it was in this light that the Tribunal held that the DMAT along with all the otherAgreements had come to an end by the efflux of time, and hence, there was no need for anytermination or rescission of the DMAT. He, therefore, submitted that the carbpl.6451.2020bcci.docx only agreement left to be rescinded and which formed part of the composite fraud was the2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA and that is what was exactly done by BCCI vide its termination notice dated28th June 2010. He therefore submitted that the findings given by the Arbitral Tribunal withrelation to the DMAT were fully justified. In any event, Mr. Dada submitted that the view taken bythe Tribunal in the Majority Award on the interpretation of the DMAT is certainly a plausible view,and hence, this Court ought not interfere with those findings under Section 34 of the ArbitrationAct.51. Mr. Dada then submitted that WSGI contends that BCCI has not been able to establish fraudbeyond reasonable doubt because the Tribunal allegedly failed to consider the materialfindings/facts i.e. MSM's Press Note. In this regard, Mr. Dada submitted that the contents of thePress Note were never proved in the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal. As such, WSGIcannot rely on the Press Note at all. The said Press Note was denied by BCCI vide its statement ofadmissions and denials dated 5th May 2017 filed in the arbitration proceedings. Thus, WSGI is notentitled to rely upon the Press Note since the contents and the truth thereof were never proved byWSGI in the arbitral proceedings. Mr. Dada submitted that despite WSGI relying heavily on MSM'sPress Note dated 23rd April 2010, it has not led evidence of any witnesses to carbpl.6451.2020bcci.docx prove the correctness of the contents thereof. Further, WSGI has also repeatedly refusedto produce the Award passed by the ICC Singapore Tribunal under which the said Tribunal held thatMSM was justified in rescinding the Facilitation Deed executed between the MSM and WSGM. Mr.Dada submitted that therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal has rightly not attached anyevidentiary value to MSM's Press Note and has not referred to or relied upon the same in itsMajority Award. For all the aforesaid reasons, Mr. Dada submitted that there was no merit in theabove Petition and the same ought to be dismissed with costs. Reasoning and Findings of the Court:52. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the papers and proceedings in theabove Petition. I have also gone through in detail the Majority Award dated 13th July 2020. Before Ideal with the arguments canvassed by the respective parties, it would be apposite to recapitulate thefacts in brief once again. In the year 2007, BCCI conceptualized the Indian Premier League [IPL]. Tolicense the Media Rights for the IPL, BCCI floated a tender. WSGI was the successful tenderer andwas accordingly awarded the Global Media Rights for the IPL for the period 2008-2017. Since WSGIwas only a trader in Media Rights, it entered into pre-bid negotiations with MSM which had abroadcasting network in India. During these negotiations, MSM, for its carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docxWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/20own commercial reasons, instead of entering into a sub-licensing Agreement with WSGI, desired toenter into a direct Media Rights License Agreement [MRLA] with BCCI. Further, MSM only wantedthe India Rights for the period 2008-2012. To facilitate this entire process, in the year 2008, thefollowing Agreements were entered into between BCCI, MSM and WSGI respectively:(a) The 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA dated 21st January 2008. This MRLA was in relation to the IndiaRights for the period of 2008-2012 and for which MSM had to directly pay BCCI an amounttotalling to USD 275.40 Million;(b) The 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008. This MRLA was executed between BCCIand WSGI for (i) The India Rights for the period 2013-2017 for a sum of USD 550 Million and (ii) The RoW Rights (i.e. excluding the India Rights) for theperiod 2008-2017 for USD 92 Million; and(c) The Option Deed dated 21st January 2008. This Agreement/Deed was executed between MSMand WSGI because MSM had only acquired the India Rights for the period 2008-2012. In the eventMSM wanted to acquire the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 from WSGI, they had the optionto do so by making a payment of a sum of upto USD 60 Million to WSGI. This payment of USD 60Million (payable to carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx WSGI) was in addition to the License Fee of USD550 Million payable to BCCI by WSGI under the 1st BCCI- WSGI MRLA (in so far as it related to theIndia rights).53. All these Agreements (and which are referred to as the MRLAs of 2008) are unquestioned. Inother words, neither BCCI nor WSGI has ever called into question the validity of these Agreements.From these Agreements it is clear that for the India Rights for the period 2008-2017, BCCI wouldreceive an aggregate amount USD 824.50 Million [ i.e. USD 274.50 Million from MSM for theperiod 2008-2012 + USD 550 Million from WSGI for the period 2013-2017]. This was equivalent toapproximately Rs.3300 crores. Further, if MSM wanted the India Rights from WSGI for period2013-2017, MSM could opt to acquire these rights on payment of USD 60 Million to WSGI as set outin the Option Deed. This was in addition to USD 550 Million that MSM would have to pay to BCCIfor the India Rights for the period 2013-2017.54. Thereafter come the Agreements executed in the year 2009. The reason why fresh Agreementshad to be executed in the year 2009 was because BCCI, on 14th March 2009, terminated its MediaRights Agreement with MSM (being the 1st BCCI-MSM MRLA dated 21st January carbpl.6451.2020bcci.docx 2008) for the period 2008-2012. Hence, the India Rights of the IPL for the period2009-2012 reverted to BCCI. Since the first season of the IPL in 2008 was a resounding success(especially in the Indian Sub- Continent), BCCI wanted to re-auction/re-sell the India Rights for theIPL for the entire period of 2009-2017 for a higher License Fee. To facilitate this process, thefollowing Agreements were entered into in the year 2009:               (a)    The Deed of Mutually Agreed Termination                      (DMAT) dated 15th March 2009. By this                      Agreement/Deed,     the   Composite    Media      RightsWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/21License Agreement entered into by BCCI with WSGI for (i) the India Rights for the period2013-2017 and(ii) the RoW Rights for the period 2008-2017 [the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21st January 2008]was terminated so that the India Rights for the period 2013-2017 reverted back to BCCI. The DMATinter alia provided that (i) a new Media Rights Agreement for the period 2009-2017 in relation toIndia Rights would be entered into by BCCI with WSGM; and (ii) for the same period, a new andseparate Media Rights Agreement would be entered into with WSGI for the RoW Rights. In otherwords, the India rights for the period 2009-2017 would be licensed to WSGM (an affiliate of WSGI)and the RoW Rights for the same period (i.e. 2009-2017) would be licensed to WSGIcarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx (and which it already had under the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 21stJanuary 2008);(b) The BCCI-WSGM MRLA dated 15th March 2009. This MRLA was executed in furtherance ofwhat was agreed to under the DMAT. This MRLA licensed the Media Rights of the IPL for the period2009-2017 to WSGM for an increased License Fee of Rs. 4791 crores. In other words, by enteringinto this MRLA with WSGM, BCCI got an additional sum of Rs.1791 crores for the India Rights forthe period 2009-2017. This is because under the MRLAs of 2008, for the same period, BCCI wouldhave got only Rs.3,000 crores. Since WSGM was not a broadcaster but only a trader in MediaRights, one of the terms of this MRLA required WSGM to enter into a sub-license Agreement with abroadcaster within 72 hours of entering into this MRLA. This requirement was thereafter extendedupto and including 24th March 2009 in view of the pending litigation in this Court and moreparticularly set out earlier in this judgement;(c) The 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA dated 25th March 2009. By this MRLA, MSM procured the IndiaRights for the period 2009-2017 directly from BCCI for a consideration of Rs.4791 crores. Accordingto WSGI, MSM was able to procure these India Rights directly from BCCI only because (i) under theDMAT, WSGI gave up its India Rights for the period 2013-2017; and carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx(ii) WSGM let its MRLA with BCCI [referred to in (b) above] lapse on 25th March 2009. Accordingto WSGI, WSGM agreed to let its MRLA [the BCCI-WSGM MRLA] lapse so that MSM, as per theirrequest/requirement, could enter into a direct MRLA with BCCI for the period 2009-2017 (for theIndia Rights). To facilitate this, MSM agreed to pay WSGM a sum of Rs. 425 crores;(d) The Deed for Provision of Facilitation Services (Facilitation Deed) dated 25th March 2009. Bythis Deed, MSM agreed to pay a Facilitation Fee of Rs.425 crores to WSGM in the manner moreparticularly set out therein. This Fee was for assisting MSM in finalizing the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLAdated 25th March 2009 [referred to in (c) above]; and(e) The 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009. This MRLA was executed because ascontemplated under the DMAT, the RoW rights of WSGI under the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA [andwhich stood terminated pursuant to the DMAT] were to be restored back to WSGI.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/2255. BCCI alleges that all the aforesaid Agreements entered into in the year 2009 (the MRLAs of2009), including the DMAT, form part of a fraudulent composite transaction which gave them theright to carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx terminate the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009.To put it in a nutshell, the fraud alleged by BCCI is that the Facilitation Fee payable by MSM toWSGM under the Facilitation Deed were monies that were actually due to BCCI. According to BCCI,all the aforesaid Agreements were entered into for the purposes of diverting to WSGM the sum ofRs.425 crores which actually belonged to BCCI. Since WSGI and WSGM are sister concerns and thefact that WSGI and WSGM were both parties to the DMAT, WSGI was complicit in the aforesaidfraud which gave BCCI the right to rescind the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009 eventhough the same pertained only to the RoW Rights (as defined in the DMAT) and not the IndiaRights. It was this rescission that was challenged before the Arbitral Tribunal, and which has beenupheld in the Majority Award.56. The first grievance made by Mr. Chinoy is that the Majority Award totally fails to advert to orconsider that by virtue of the Agreements entered into in 2009, and which BCCI now alleges are apart of an "all pervasive fraud", BCCI was able to receive an increased License Fee of Rs. 4791 croresfor the India Rights for the period 2009-2017 in contrast to the amount of Rs.3,000 crores thatBCCI would have received under the MRLAs of 2008 for the same period. In other words, by virtueof the Agreements entered into in 2009, BCCI benefited to the tune of carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docxapproximately Rs.1791 crores. The Tribunal has failed to consider this enormous benefit that inuredto BCCI, and the fact that BCCI retained the same. This according to Mr. Chinoy is a fundamentalerror on the part of the Tribunal as it completely ignores and fails to take into consideration thisvital fact which goes to the root of the matter.57. I have carefully gone through the Majority Award. It can't be disputed that by virtue of theAgreements entered into 2009, BCCI was able to re-sell/re-auction the India Rights for the period2009-2017 for a sum totalling to Rs.4791 crores. It is also not in dispute that under theunquestioned 2008 MRLAs, for the same period, BCCI would have received a sum of Rs.3000crores for the India Rights. This means that by virtue of the Agreements entered into in 2009(including the DMAT), BCCI got a benefit of Rs.1791 crores. Despite this, I find that the MajorityAward nowhere mentions or considers this enormous benefit that was received by BCCI under theAgreements entered into in the year 2009. I must mention that this was specifically put in issuebefore the Tribunal in the post hearing submissions submitted by WSGI. The relevant portion ofthese submissions read thus:-"99. Admittedly, the Respondent has taken the benefit of the Termination Deedwithout which it could not have consolidated and sold the Indian Sub-ContinentRights for carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx an increased rights fee of Rs. 1,791 crores,initially to WSGM and ultimately to MSM under the direct licence under the 2ndBCCI MSM MRLA. Similarly, the Respondent fought tooth and nail to resist theproceedings initiated by MSM against the Respondent following the termination ofthe 1st BCCI MSM MRLA by relying upon the BCCI WSGM MRLA. Mr Lalit Modifiled an affidavit on behalf of the Respondent (the LKM Affidavit), before the BombayHigh Court stating that the BCCI WSGM MRLA had been entered into between theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/23parties at 3 am on 15 March 2009 [Page 1-4; CCD (Vol VII)] [Page 979 (Typed Copy);CTC]. Based on the various submissions by the Respondent's counsel at the timebefore the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on, inter alia, the validity of the BCCI WSGMMRLA, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court disallowed interim relief to MSM throughthe Bombay High Court Order [Page 273-316; CCD (Vol 1)]"(emphasis supplied)58. In fact, it was specifically argued before the Tribunal that if the fraud was an "allpervasive fraud" and which attached itself even to the DMAT, then, all Agreements,including the DMAT had to be rescinded. BCCI could not have merely rescinded the2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA and that too for an alleged fraud which did not in any wayattach itself to the RoW rights but only to the India Rights. To counter the argumentof Mr. Chinoy on this aspect, Mr. Dada submitted that the aforesaid benefit whichallegedly accrued to BCCI has in fact been considered in the Majority Award andmore particularly paragraphs 35 to 37 thereof. Paragraphs 35 to 37 read thus:-carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx "35. The next question which arises is: If the final resultwas to grant RoW rights for the years 2009-2017 to WSGI why was the firstBCCI-WSGI-MRLA which did precisely this, terminated? The Claimant's submissionis that this was done in order to unbundle the India Rights for 2013 to 2017 so as tomake its subsequent aggregation with India Rights for 2009-2012 possible, whichwould get for the Respondent more money. This does not appear to be convincing. Inthe first place, apart from this submission, there is no oral evidence before us tosupport such a reason. If we look at the documentary evidence, Clause 2 of the Deedof Mutually Agreed Termination of 1st WSGI Media Rights Agreement provides asfollows:2.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that the BCCI has terminated BCCI- Sonyagreement and that given the proximity of the start of the 2009 IPL season, and itsobligations to its stakeholders and to protect the interests of such stakeholders, theBCCI wishes to execute new media rights agreements for the period 2009-2017 on anexpedited basis.2.2 In order to facilitate this process, and for good and valuable consideration, theparties have mutually agreed to terminate the WSG media rights agreement and toenter into the new WSG media rights agreements.2.3 The parties shall have no liability to each other as a result of the mutually agreedtermination of the WSG media rights agreement.36. There is no reference to unbundling of India rights by WSGI in order to enhance the value ofIndia rights by achieving a package for the India rights for 2009-2017 which would be attractive tothe market. On the contrary the Deed of Mutually Agreed Termination records that the partiesWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/24agreed to terminate the first BCCI-WSGI-MRLA for good and valuable consideration. It is not clearwhat this good carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx and valuable consideration was. Looking at theAgreements entered into thereafter, was this good and valuable consideration the agreement of theRespondent with WSGM?37. This is supported by Clause 29 of the first BCCI-WSGI-MRLA which requires that if Sony agreement (MSM) is terminated for whateverreason prior to the end of the rights period, the Respondent will be required to meetWSGI as soon as practicable with a view to agree in good faith by which of the partiesand on what basis the rights pursuant to such termination can be exploited within theIndian subcontinent. Thus the 3 parties namely Mr. Modi, WSGI and WSGM haveacted in consultation and collusion with each other in formulating the agreementssubsequent to the termination of the first BCCI-MSM- MRLA."59. From the aforesaid paragraphs of the Majority Award, I do not find anything therein that wouldlead me to believe that the Tribunal in the Majority Award has considered the benefit of Rs.1791crores that inured to BCCI and the effect it would have on BCCI's rescission of the 2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA dated 25th March 2009. In fact, there is absolutely no mention of the figures of "Rs.4791crores" or "Rs.1791 crores" in the Majority Award. It is completely silent as far as these figures areconcerned. There is absolutely no mention in the aforesaid paragraphs regarding the fact that by theAgreements entered into in the year 2009, and under which WSGI gave up its India Rights for theperiod 2013-2017 to BCCI in order to enable it to aggregate the same with the India Rights for theperiod 2009-2012, an enormous benefit of Rs.1791 crores inured carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx toBCCI. In fact, all that the Majority Tribunal has done is that it sets out the argument of WSGI in partand thereafter gives the finding that the same "does not appear to be convincing". From what isstated in the said paragraphs, it would effectively mean that WSGI gave up its valuable India Rightsfor the period 2013-2017 to get absolutely nothing in return, when in contrast, under unquestioned2008 MRLAs (Option Deed) if WSGI were to give up its India Rights for the period 2013-2017 toMSM, they would be paid up to USD 60 Million. This interpretation of the Tribunal in the MajorityAward is unsustainable. From the DMAT (dated 15th March 2009), it is ex-facie clear that WSGIagreed to the termination of the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA so that BCCI would be able to re-license theIndia Rights for the period 2009-2017 for a much higher price and which would be licensed toWSGM (an affiliate of WSGI). Further, the RoW Rights would be granted back to WSGI for theperiod 2009-2017. It was to facilitate BCCI receiving a higher License Fee that WSGI agreed to thetermination of the 1st BCCI-WSGI MRLA so that BCCI could re-license the India Rights for theentire period (2009-2017) as a single package. Any other interpretation just does not make anysense. The findings in Majority Award would effectively mean that WSGI gave up its valuable IndiaRights to BCCI for the period 2013-2017 just to get it back through its affiliate - WSGM and that tooby agreeing to pay an additional amount of Rs.1791 crores. When one reads these Agreementstogether with the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx findings and reasons given in the Majority Award, Ifind that the issue regarding BCCI receiving a benefit of Rs.1791 crores by virtue of the aforesaidtransaction and the effect it would have on BCCI's right to terminate/rescind the 2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA dated 25th March 2009, is completely missed in the Majority Award. In my view, before theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/25Tribunal (in the Majority Award) upheld BCCI's rescission on the ground of an "all pervasive fraud",it ought to have considered whether the said rescission could be held to be valid when BCCI hadreceived a benefit of Rs. 1791 crores under the very Agreements which it now alleges form thesubject matter of a fraudulent composite transaction, and which in turn, gave BCCI the right toterminate the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA. I say this because it is trite law that a party cannot bepermitted to approbate and reprobate at the same time. A party cannot be permitted to blow hot andcold, fast and loose or approbate and reprobate. When one party knowingly accepts the benefits of acontract, it is estopped by denying the validity and binding effect of that contract on him. Once aparty takes advantage of any instrument, he must accept all that is mentioned in the said document.This has been so held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhagat Sharan v/s Purushottamand Ors [(2020) 6 SCC 387], the relevant portion of which reads thus:-"26. It is also not disputed that the plaintiff and Defendants 1 to 3 herein filed suit foreviction of an occupant in which he claimed that the property had been bequeathedto him by Hari Ram. According to the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx defendants, theplaintiff having accepted the will of Hariram and having taken benefit of the same,cannot turn around and urge that the will is not valid and that the entire property is ajoint family property. The plaintiff and Defendants 1 to 3 by accepting the bequestunder the will elected to accept the will. It is trite law that a party cannot bepermitted to approbate and reprobate at the same time. This principle is based on theprinciple of doctrine of election. In respect of wills, this doctrine has been held tomean that a person who takes benefit of a portion of the will cannot challenge theremaining portion of the will. In Rajasthan State Industrial Development &Investment Corpn. v. Diamond & Gem Development Corpn. Ltd. [Rajasthan StateIndustrial Development & Investment Corpn. v. Diamond & Gem DevelopmentCorpn. Ltd., (2013) 5 SCC 470 : (2013) 3 SCC (Civ) 153 : AIR 2013 SC 1241] , thisCourt made an observation that a party cannot be permitted to "blow hot and cold","fast and loose" or "approbate and reprobate". Where one party knowingly acceptsthe benefits of a contract or conveyance or an order, it is estopped to deny the validityor binding effect on him of such contract or conveyance or order.27. The doctrine of election is a facet of law of estoppel. A party cannot blow hot and blow cold at thesame time. Any party which takes advantage of any instrument must accept all that is mentioned inthe said document. It would be apposite to refer to the treatise Equity--A Course of Lectures by F.W.Maitland, Cambridge University, 1947, wherein the learned author succinctly described principle ofelection in the following terms:"The doctrine of election may be thus stated : that he who accepts a benefit under adeed or will or other instrument must adopt the whole contents of that instrument,must conform to all its provisions and renounce all rights that are inconsistent withit...."This view has been accepted to be the correct view in Karam Kapahi v. Lal Chand Public CharitableTrust [Karam Kapahi v. Lal Chand Public Charitable Trust, (2010) 4 SCC 753 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ)World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/26262] . The plaintiff having elected to accept the will of Hari Ram, by filing a suit for eviction of thetenant by claiming that the property had been bequeathed to him by Hari Ram, cannot now turnaround and say that the averments made by Hari Ram that the property was his personal property,is incorrect."(emphasis supplied) carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx60. I am mindful of the fact that a challenge to an Arbitral Award under Section 34 of theArbitration Act is not equivalent to an Appeal. The grounds on which an Arbitral Award can bechallenged are circumscribed by section 34 and the judicial precedents interpreting the saidprovision. One of the grounds to challenge a domestic Arbitral Award, even after the amendment ofthe Act in 2015, is that it suffers from a patent illegality. The Supreme Court has clearly held that adecision of the Tribunal which is perverse, while no longer being a ground of challenge under the"public policy of India", would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of theAward. The Supreme Court has inter alia held that a finding in the Award based on no evidence oran Award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, would be perverse and liable to beset aside on the ground of patent illegality. This has so been held by the Supreme Court in the caseof Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, [(2019) 15 SCC 131]. The relevant portion ofthis decision reads thus:"36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, thata domestic award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as understoodin paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49: (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , or secondly, that such award is against basic notions ofjustice or morality as understood in paras 36 to 39 of Associate Builders [Associatecarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ)204] . Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Section 48(2)(b)(ii)was added by the Amendment Act only so that Western Geco [ONGC v. Western GecoInternational Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 :(2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , as understood in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , and paras 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with.37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an additional ground is now availableunder sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34. Here, there must bepatent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes to the rootof the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law. In short, what isnot subsumed within "the fundamental policy of Indian law", namely, the contravention of a statutenot linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it comes tosetting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate courtis permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face ofthe award.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/2739. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 :(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , namely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself, isno longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate Builders[Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , however, would remain, forif an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, thatwould certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the award.40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paras42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ)204] , namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator todecide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonableperson would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. Also, if thearbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits anerror of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added underSection 34(2-A).carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx41. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , whileno longer being a ground for challenge under "public policy of India", would certainly amount to apatent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or anaward which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be setaside on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents taken behindthe back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no evidenceinasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would alsohave to be characterised as perverse.*******************76. However, when it comes to the public policy of India, argument based upon "most basic notionsof justice", it is clear that this ground can be attracted only in very exceptional circumstances whenthe conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction of fundamental notions or principles of justice.It can be seen that the formula that was applied by the agreement continued to be applied tillFebruary 2013 -- in short, it is not correct to say that the formula under the agreement could not beapplied in view of the Ministry's change in the base indices from 1993-1994 to 2004-2005. Further,in order to apply a linking factor, a Circular, unilaterally issued by one party, cannot possibly bindthe other party to the agreement without that other party's consent. Indeed, the Circular itselfexpressly stipulates that it cannot apply unless the contractors furnish an undertaking/affidavit thatthe price adjustment under the Circular is acceptable to them. We have seen how the appellant gavesuch undertaking only conditionally and without prejudice to its argument that the Circular does notand cannot apply. This being the case, it is clear that the majority award has created a new contractfor the parties by applying the said unilateral Circular and by substituting a workable formula underthe agreement by another formula dehors the agreement. This being the case, a fundamentalWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/28principle of justice has been breached, namely, that a unilateral addition or alteration of a contractcan never be foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the agreement be liable to perform abargain not entered into with the other party. Clearly, such a course of conduct would be contrary tofundamental principles of justice as followed in this country, and shocks the conscience of thisCourt. However, we repeat that this ground is available only in very exceptional circumstances, suchas the fact situation in the present case. Under no circumstance can any court interfere with anarbitral award on the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx ground that justice has not been done in theopinion of the Court. That would be an entry into the merits of the dispute which, as we have seen, iscontrary to the ethos of Section 34 of the 1996 Act, as has been noted earlier in this judgment."(emphasis supplied)61. The fact that the Tribunal in the Majority Award has completely failed to consider the issueregarding BCCI receiving a benefit of Rs.1791 crores by virtue of the Agreements entered into in2009 (including the DMAT), and the effect it would have on BCCI's right to terminate/rescind the2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March 2009, would render the Majority Award susceptible tochallenge on the ground of patent illegality. I say this because this is an issue that goes to the root ofthe matter on whether BCCI, having retained the benefit of Rs.1791 crores under the Agreements of2009, could rescind the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA (dated 25th March 2009) on the ground that all theAgreements entered into in 2009 (including the DMAT), and under which BCCI received theaforesaid benefit, were a part of a fraudulent composite transaction. Failing to consider thisfundamental issue which goes to the root of the matter, renders the Majority Award susceptible tochallenge as it clearly suffers from a patent illegality and is therefore liable to be set aside on thisground alone.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx62. I must also mention that the Majority Award completely fails to consider MSM's Press Notedated 23rd April 2010. Mr. Dada submitted that MSM's Press Note has not been referred to in theMajority Award because the same was objected to by BCCI and was not proved by WSGI during thearbitration proceedings. I find this submission to be factually incorrect. In the Minority Award, atparagraph 62 thereof, the Dissenting Arbitrator specifically refers to the Press Note. In the MinorityAward, the Dissenting Arbitrator specifically records that BCCI objected to the Press Note issued byMSM as not being proved during the cross examination of RW-4. However, this was not accepted bythe Tribunal. The relevant portion of the Minority Award reads thus:"62. MSM on 21 April 2010 issued a press statement on the IPL Broadcast rights inwhich it narrated the circumstances in which the 1st BCCI MSM MRLA wasterminated and the 2nd BCCI MSM MRLA was executed including the payment offacilitation fees of Rs.4,250,000,000/- to WSGM. In the Press Statement, MSMreferred to the BCCI WSGM Agreement dated 15 March 2009 under which WSGMwas awarded the India Sub-continent Rights, which formed the basis for MSMentering into extensive discussions with the Respondent. In the Press Statement,MSM does not refer to any agreement between the Respondent and WSGM on 23World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/29March 2009 or that it had been in any manner been defrauded. Also, in the PressStatement, MSM defended the entire transaction and explained the events, includingthe basis for calculating the amount of Rs.425 Crores agreed to be paid to WSGM(Paragraph 7):carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx "5. Intense commercial negotiations ensued with otherbroadcasters also expressing interest making the situation extremely competitive.After protracted negotiations between MSM, WSG Mauritius and BCCI, MSMentered into a renegotiated agreement on the IPL broadcasting rights with the BCCIat the same consideration offered by WSG Mauritius and for the same duration (9years), in lieu of WSG Mauritius relinquishing its rights, thereby achieving both itsgoals"This press release by MSM, one of the main beneficiaries in the entire transactionand who according to the Respondent was not part of the alleged fraud, states thatthe entire India sub- continent media rights transaction was done after negotiationsand with the WSGM relinquishing its rights. This would be an important aspect to beconsidered. Moreover, this press release again relates to the India sub-continentmedia rights, whereas the subject matter of the present arbitration is the RoW mediarights. Respondent objected to the press release by MSM as not being proved duringthe cross examination of RW-4 but this was not accepted by the Tribunal at Pg.358CCE, q.3-RW-4."(emphasis supplied)63. The only reason why I am reproducing the relevant portion of the Minority Awardis to show that this argument of BCCI, and which was canvassed by Mr. Dada beforeme, was negated by the Tribunal. Non-consideration of this Press Note would also goto the root of the matter considering that the aforesaid Press Note sets out in detail asto under what circumstances the amount of Rs.425 crores was payable by MSM toWSGM. In fact, the consideration of carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx the Press Notewould have been vital before giving any finding of fraud being established. This PressNote, and which relates to the India Rights for the period 2009-2017, at least, primafacie, indicates that WSGMs rights under the BCCI-WSGM MRLA had not merelylapsed or come to an end simplicitor on 25th March 2009 as contended by BCCI, butWSGM allowed its MRLA to lapse in order to facilitate MSM entering into a directcontract with BCCI for the India Rights for the period 2009-2017. In considerationfor this, MSM agreed to pay a Facilitation Fee which was quantified at Rs.425 crores.The relevant portion of the said Press Note reads thus:-"We wish to state that all transactions relating to MSM's acquisition of the broadcastmedia rights in 2008 as well as 2009, have been undertaken with full knowledge ofall the parties; in an open and transparent manner and in keeping with applicablelaws.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/30MSM strongly refutes all unsubstantiated allegations of any impropriety in thismatter, as incorrect and inaccurate.To clarify the situation and our position, we wish to highlight the following:A quick summary1. On March 14, 2009, the BCCI unilaterally terminated the then existingbroadcasting rights agreement dated 21 January 2008 with MSM.2. MSM immediately initiated legal action against the BCCI in carbpl.6451.2020bcci.docx Bombay High Court to stay the termination. However, BCCI had vested theIndian subcontinent broadcasting rights with WSG Mauritius, for a nine year period(2009-2017) under an agreement dated 15 March 2009.3. Given that the contract had already been awarded to WSG Mauritius, the court didnot grant MSM a stay leaving MSM the only recourse to sue BCCI for damages or tryto secure the rights back through a commercial negotiation. MSM opted to enter intoa commercial negotiation to try and re- secure the rights.4. MSM's goals in the commercial negotiation were two-fold:i) to secure the rights that had been unilaterally terminated and for the entire 9 yearperiod keeping BCCI unaffected by paying the same amount to BCCI as contracted byWSG Mauritius, and ii) It was MSM's clear position that to secure its businessinterests, the broadcasting rights agreement should be a direct contract with theBCCI, rather than as a sub-license under an agreement with WSG Mauritius, whichhad these rights, as per the agreement with BCCI, dated March 15, 2009. To facilitateMSM's condition for a direct contract with BCCI, WSG Mauritius agreed to give up itsbroadcast rights for the Indian subcontinent in favour of MSM, thus paving the wayfor BCCI & MSM to enter into a contract directly. In consideration for this, MSMagreed to pay WSG Mauritius a facilitation fee.5. MSM wishes to re-emphasize here that the 'Facilitation Fee' of Rs 425 crores to WSG Mauritius isfor:a. the original option fee of $25 million (Rs. 115 crores approximately) to extend the rights to years 6till 10, b. an additional fee over the 9 years of the contract of Rs. 310 crores. These fees were tocompensate WSG Mauritius for returning its rights for IPL season 2 - 10 to BCCI in favour of MSMand were necessary if MSM was to secure the rights to IPL season 2- 10.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx However, the potential rating incentive at the end of year 5 of $ 35million (Rs. 160 crores) under the agreement dated 21 January 2008 was eliminated, and c. as aconsequence of these commercial negotiations the net incremental amount attributable to WSGWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/31Mauritius giving up its IPL Indian subcontinent rights is Rs. 150 crores.6. MSM also wishes to state that the payments made to BCCI and WSG Mauritius have been inaccordance with applicable laws and as per established international cross border banking normsand procedures.i. MSM received tax advice from external tax experts that the transaction with WSG Mauritius didnot attract India taxes and MSM has accordingly not withheld any Indian tax. MSM has accountedfor the payments in its financial statements which have been audited and filed before statutoryauthorities. MSM has acted at all times with impeccable integrity and highest ethical standards andcorporate Governance. MSM has complied with applicable laws. Allegations in certain sections ofthe media attributing wrongful conduct to MSM are incorrect and completely unfounded."(emphasis supplied)64. It is important to note that BCCI alleges in its termination notice that MSM was misled tobelieve that there was an MRLA with WSGM dated 23rd March 2009. However, in the Press Note,MSM makes no reference to any MRLA of 23rd March 2009 but in fact correctly mentions that theBCCI-WSGM MRLA was dated 15th carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx March 2009. I fail to understand asto how MSM was misled when even in its own Press Note it has stated that the BCCI-WSGM MRLAwas dated 15th March 2009. In fact, this Press Note also goes on to explain with great clarity as towhy Rs.425 crores was payable to WSGM. Non-consideration of this Press Note, and the effect itwould have on the finding of fraud, is also completely missed by the Arbitral Tribunal in theMajority Award which would render it vulnerable to challenge.65. This apart, even as far as the finding of fraud is concerned, I find that the reasoning of theTribunal in the Majority Award is much to be desired. It was the case of BCCI, and which wasaccepted by the Tribunal in the Majority Award, that a fraud was committed on BCCI and MSMbecause a sum of Rs. 425 crores was diverted to WSGM when the aforesaid amount ought to havebeen paid and belonged to BCCI. The Tribunal holds that looking at the terms of the Agreements asentered into in the year 2009, the reasons alleged by the Claimant (WSGI) for subsequent changesas against the reasons pointed out by the Respondent (BCCI), the manner in which WSGM wasintroduced as a party to one of the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx transactions, the subsequenttermination of that transaction and the absence of knowledge of the Respondent (BCCI) regardingthe exact nature of the various transactions, especially the liability imposed upon the Respondent(BCCI), the fraud as alleged was established beyond reasonable doubt. I fail to understand how theMajority Award has come to this finding. Firstly, how BCCI is entitled to Rs.425 crores is somethingthat is not explained in the Majority Award. From the documents on record, namely the Agreementsentered into in the year 2009 as well as the Press Note issued by MSM dated 23rd April 2010, primafacie, it would appear that Rs.425 crores was to be paid to WSGM for giving up its India Rights forthe period 2009-2017, and which had come to it by virtue of the DMAT read with the BCCI-WSGMMRLA dated 15th March 2009. I fail to understand how a fraud in such transaction is alleged, atleast qua BCCI. What is important to note is that in the MRLAs of 2008, and which are undisputedlyunquestioned documents, a similar provision finds place in the "Option Deed" executed betweenWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/32MSM and WSGI which inter alia contemplated that if MSM wanted the India Rights for the period2013-2017, they would have to pay WSGI a sum of USD 60 Million. It has never been BCCI's casethat the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx aforesaid Option Deed was in any way fraudulent or that theamount of USD 60 Million which WSGI would have got under the Option Deed was actually moneywhich was due and payable to BCCI. I, therefore, find that on the material on record, and especiallythe non-consideration of the MSM Press Note, the Tribunal (in the Majority Award) could not havecome to the conclusion that fraud on BCCI was proved, either on the preponderance of probabilitiesor beyond reasonable doubt. This being the case, even on this count, the Award is unsustainable.66. There is yet another reason why I find that the Majority Award is required to be interfered with.In paragraph 61 of the Majority Award, the arbitrators hold as under:"61. IPL GC meeting did take place and was held on 11th August, 2009 and there isnothing on record to suggest the second BCCI WSGI MRLA and second BCCI MSMMRLA were discussed and brought to the attention of the Governing Councilmembers of the IPL for approval in the said meeting. There is also nothing on recordto show that the contracts were available at the meeting either and, therefore, therecould not have been any ratification and even if there be any ratification, the samewas obtained fraudulently by suppressing the most relevant clauses and bysuppressing the Facilitation Deed whereby legitimate fund of the BCCI was sought tobe diverted and misappropriated and therefore rightly the BCCI took steps forrescission of such carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx transaction."(emphasis supplied)67. As can be seen from the aforesaid reproduction, the Majority Award holds thatthere is nothing on record to show that the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA dated 25th March2009 or the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA also dated 25th March 2009, were available at the meeting held on 11th August 2009and therefore there could have been no ratification. I am unable to understand how the Tribunal inthe Majority Award has come to this finding when there is a detailed discussion on this aspect in theMinority Award from Paragraphs 159 to 178 thereof, which read thus:"159) IPL GC members, by way of the agenda for the 11 August 2009 IPL GC meeting,which had been circulated to them as far back as 2 August 2009, had been givenaccess to the MRLAs, apart from the detailed write-ups on them in the financialstatements forming part of the agenda papers.160) Item 6.c shown at Page 675, Vol.II of CCD gives the provisional income andexpenditure for IPL 2009 along with the statement of all expenses by vendor. TheClaimant's argument seems to be correct inasmuch as the media rights fee payable byMSM and the Claimant to the Respondent is provided and the sum payable fromMSM to Respondent increases substantially. That is reflected in the document.World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/33161) Item 6.f shown at Page 713,Vol.II of CCD under the heading approval of allvendor contracts for 2009 season is a statement that "All vendor contracts are placedhere in the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx office along with the multiple quotes that arereceived from various parties." The Respondent's contention that Item 6.f was leftblank therefore cannot be accepted.162) I have examined the Respondent's allegation that Mr. Modi added the 2009 MRLA's toAnnexure C to the minutes post circulation and approval of the minutes of the IPL GC Meeting of 11August 2009 and find it meritless. Firstly, not a single witness led by the Respondent has supportedsuch a finding that the Annexure C which contains the list of the MRLA's was circulated much laterto the meeting. It is noteworthy that there is no specific testimony of this fact or for instance whendid the Respondent notice that the Minutes were incorrect or had been supplemented with theAnnexure C which purportedly was not shared at the time of the meeting.163) The Vendor contract argument raised by the Respondent is false. Along with the MRLAs therewere a number of other agreements which had been placed in the Vendor category including the'BCCI-IPL' CSA Agreement. In his cross- examination, RW-3 categorically states that though he mayhave referred to the MRLAs as 'Vendor Agreements', there is no such definition of VendorAgreements in the Respondent's approval process [Q.54 (page 366); CCE]. Thus, there is nomaterial to indicate that the 'Vendor Agreements' would have only included a particular class ofagreements. The Respondent's arguments fall on this point as well.164) No rule or practice has been put forth in evidence that media rights agreements wereprohibited from being placed in the category of vendor contracts. There are only few minutes of theIPL GC meetings which have been placed on the record of this arbitration and they again do notdisclose that media rights contracts were placed in a separate category or that there was a greatamount of discussion between the members on such contracts.165) Even if it were put under the head of vendor contracts, it carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx would bethe duty of the members sitting in a meeting to have gone through all the matters noted in theAgenda note while approving them. Once the Agenda is approved, the conclusion that would followis that it has been duly considered and approved. In absence of anything more, the evidence of theinterested party witnesses saying that they did not peruse the entirety of the document beforeapproving, would not be sufficient to hold that the members approving did not have full knowledgeor their knowledge was defective. Also, none of the members of the IPL GC have deposed to thateffect, rather the evidence is of the non-voting members. In any event, the very fact that all matterswere put in the Agenda Note it would rule out any case of fraud or collusion.166) The Respondent has argued extensively that the ratification of the 2nd BCCI WSGI MRLA and2nd BCCI MSM MRLA can only occur with the full knowledge of all facts including any irregularity.In support, it has been argued that the contracts were not available at the meeting, there was also nospecific mention of the contracts in the minutes which would show that they were not orallymentioned or discussed at the meeting. On this basis, the Respondent contends that the allegedratification that is obtained fraudulently by suppressing the most relevant clauses cannot be said toWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/34be valid or binding on BCCI. The Respondent in response to the Claimant's argument that officebearers had no voting rights in the IPL GC meeting stated that President and Secretary supervise theoverall affairs of the BCCI and their knowledge is relevant for determining the BCCI's knowledge.167) The Claimant's arguments were that the persons who were entitled to vote and ratify thecontracts were the members of the IPL GC. RW-3 and RW-4 were office bearers who were ex-officiomembers without any voting rights. The Respondent has led no evidence to show that the usualprocedure for ratification was for considering the detailed terms and conditions of theterms/contracts. Also, there was clear and detailed reference to the media rights carbpl.6451.2020bcci.docx agreement in the Agenda note and the agreements were available for inspection, thus, theratification was done with knowledge.168) I have considered the material and evidence on record on this point of ratification. There is noquarrel with the legal proposition in the judgments cited by the Respondent on this point such as T.R. Pratt (Bombay) Ltd v E.D. Sassoon and Co Ltd [1935] LX ILR Bom. 326 as also Premila Devi vThe peoples Bank of Northern India [1938] ILR Lah 1 PC concerning ratification.169) It has emerged in the Respondent's evidence that the only persons in the IPL GoverningCouncil who were entitled to vote and take decisions were the members appointed by the GeneralBody of the Respondent. These were the persons concerned who would approve/ratify the actions.The office bearers who were part of the IPL GC were ex- officio members but did not have any votingpower. This has been elicited in the cross examination of RW-1 where he has stated in answer to aquestion (Line 10 at Page 217 of CCE) that: Q. Are they allowed to vote in the meeting? A. Themembers vote for that. The office bearers definitely don't participate in the voting part of it becausethe decision makers are the members of that. Q. Do they vote or not in the meeting to yourknowledge? A. The Committee is responsible to take decisions and the committee is the memberswho are appointed by the general body who take decisions.170) The Respondent has contended that the reliance on RW-1's evidence is misplaced. No reasonhas been given for this. Even so, it is not just RW-1's who has deposed on this point. RW-3 who wasPresident of the Respondent at the relevant time also testified in his cross-examination that the onlypersons who were entitled to vote were the members appointed by the general body and theex-officio members could not vote. This can be found at Line 16 at Page 323 of CCE- Q. In terms ofability to participate in meetings, there is no difference between an ex-officio member and acarbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx member, right? A. No, the right to vote was only with the members. Wenever had a right to vote. If there was voting in the meeting, we never had a right to vote. Q.Whenever a vote was called, you weren't entitled to vote? A. I can only- with regard to thedeliberations, we could participate.171) The conclusion therefore has to be that the persons entitled to vote and the decision makers atthe 11 August IPL GC were those who were members of the council. Any defect in knowledge or theabsence of the proper ratification because the relevant clauses in the 2nd BCCI WSGI MRLA wereconcealed or that there was no discussion concerning these contracts had to be established byreference to the state of mind of the person entitled to vote and who were the decision makers asWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/35they would have approved and ratified the 2nd BCCI WSGI MRLA. However no such evidence wasled by the Respondent and in this state of affairs I am unable to accept the Respondent's argumentthat the ratification was defective and that the 2nd BCCI WSGI MRLA cannot be said to be valid orbind the Respondent.172) On this point, the Respondent further argued that President and Secretary of the BCCIsupervise the overall affairs of the Respondent and their knowledge therefore is relevant fordetermining the state of knowledge of the Respondent. That may well be correct, but in my view, itdoes not advance the Respondent's case any further as their state of knowledge is irrelevant for thepurposes of determining whether the ratification of the 2nd BCCI WSGI MRLA was defective or not.173) There is again no evidence of the steps taken by the Respondent when it discovered the belatedaddition of Annexure C to the Minutes. These factual matters which are stated to be part of andactively conceal the Fraudulent Composite Transaction cannot be decided on the basis of argumentswithout evidence. Secondly, the Minutes of 11 August 2009 IPL GC Meeting clearly state thatApproval of all contracts for 2009 season-All contract were entered the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docxapproved List (Which was attached as Annexure C).174) If agreements were approved without the Annexure C, i.e. the List which contains theagreements, then the persons present there including RW-3 and RW-4 would have led evidence thatthe members approved and ratified the contracts in the absence of Annexure C. There is no suchevidence. Even the draft agenda which was circulated by Mr. Modi on 25 August 2009 by his emailat Page 1253, Vol.III of CCD carried the same line namely Approval of all contracts for 2009season-All contract entered were approved (List attached as Annexure C). The Minutes of 11 August2009 IPL GC Meeting were annexed but did not contain the Annexure C.175) Even so there does not seem to be any correspondence from any members after the 2September 2009 that the Annexure C was not shown to them. There is the email from RW-3 on 25August 2009 responding to the draft agenda sent by Mr. Modi regarding the incorrect recording ofthe minutes in relation to IMG. Even that email does not raise any question on the Annexure C andno other correspondence has been produced by the Respondent on this point. As such it is notpossible to accept the Respondent's argument that the Annexure C was included subsequent to theapproval of the Minutes of the 11 August 2009 IPL GC meeting.176) After allegedly coming to know of the transactions in April, 2010, the Respondent let the thirdseason of the IPL and collected license fee from the Claimant under the subject Agreement. In myview, this in itself would be an act of ratification by conduct.177) The Agreement had been acted upon and the Respondent has also received consideration in theform of media rights fees for the IPL 2009 and 2010 season from the Claimant. The IPL matcheswere in fact broadcast to various Rest of the World territories as envisaged under the 2nd BCCIWSGI MRLA and the Respondent was fully aware about who was carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docxresponsible for it in addition to the fact that these agreements were ratified at the August 2009 GCmeeting. After taking the advantage and benefit of the Agreement for 2 years, in my view, theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/36Respondent cannot be permitted to unsettle the agreement by stating that it was not bound by theacts of the IPL Chairman & Commissioner, who I have already found was authorised to enter intothe contracts relating to media rights.178) To ascertain ratification, the entirety of the facts and circumstances has to be taken intoaccount. After taking into account the entirety of facts, I am of the view that the Respondent hadelected to ratify (expressly and even impliedly) the 2nd BCCI-WSGI Agreement. It had also ratifiedthe other media rights transactions in relation to the Indian sub-continent done by the IPLChairman and Commissioner. Such ratification was consciously done and implemented. I do notfind that such ratification suffered from fraud or material defects, as alleged.(emphasis supplied)68. I have set out the relevant paragraphs of the Minority Award only to show that there was enoughfactual material before the Tribunal in relation to the fact that the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA and the2nd BCCI- MSM MRLA were available at the meeting held on 11th August 2009. Despite all thismaterial (as set out in the Minority Award and which is factual in nature), the Arbitrators in theMajority Award come to a finding that there is nothing on record to show that the 2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA and the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA were available at the meeting held on 11th August 2009. Thisfinding of the Tribunal clearly goes to show that it has carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx ignored thefactual material before it in relation to the meeting held by the IPL Governing Council on 11thAugust 2009. The consideration of this material would also have an important bearing on theargument of BCCI that it had no knowledge of these Agreements until the discovery of the fraud inJune 2010 and consequently, all the Agreements entered into in the year 2009 formed part of afraudulent composite transaction, which in turn, entitled BCCI to rescind the 2nd BCCI-WSGIMRLA dated 25th March 2009. Non-consideration of this material and the effect it would have onthe issue of fraud is another factor that would render the award unsustainable.69. I have carefully gone through the Majority Award as well as the Minority Award. The reason Ihave examined both the Awards is not to see which view is correct. I have undertaken this exerciseonly because it was the case of WSGI that a lot of important material and which would have abearing on the outcome of the dispute between WSGI and BCCI, was ignored by the Arbitratorspassing the Majority Award. In fact, when I went through the Majority Award in detail, I find thatone of the reasons why the Tribunal held that a fraud was played on BCCI was because BCCI wascompletely unaware of the Agreements entered into in the year 2009 and specifically the 2ndBCCI-WSGI MRLA and the 2nd BCCI-MSM MRLA. The argument of WSGI before the Tribunal wasthat Mr. Lalit carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Modi acted throughout on behalf of BCCI and thereforeBCCI had full knowledge of these Agreements (constructive or otherwise). Further, the Agreementsin question were drafted by the International Management Group (IMG), an Agency with GlobalExpertise in Sports Media Rights and who was engaged by BCCI to assist in the organization of theIPL. It was argued by WSGI before the Tribunal that Mr. Paul Manning of IMG drafted all theAgreements who had complete knowledge of all the Clauses therein, including the contentiousClauses. It was, therefore, argued that the knowledge of Mr. Paul Manning must be attributed toBCCI. In support of this proposition, WSGI relied upon a case of Bradley v. Riches (1878) 9World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/37Ch.D.189 which states that a solicitor can be presumed to have communicated to his clients, thefacts which he ought to have made known.70. To substantiate the argument that BCCI was in the know of all the aforesaid Agreements, WSGIhad also filed an Interim Application before the Tribunal on 14th October 2016. In that application,amongst other things, WSGI demanded documents exchanged between BCCI and IMG between theperiod 15th March 2009 to 30th May 2009 in relation to the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA.71. What is interesting to note is that the Tribunal, by its order carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx dated 3rdApril 2017 (pages 423 to 430 of the paper book), stated that it was not necessary to direct BCCI todisclose these documents because BCCI has not denied that IMG was appointed by BCCI and wasadvising BCCI. The Tribunal also recorded that BCCI accepted that IMG was not Mr. Lalit Modi'spersonal adviser. The relevant portion of the Tribunal's order dated 3rd April 2017 reads thus:-"(b) Documents exchanged between the Respondent and the IMG on the subjectSecond BCCI WSGI MRLA between 15th March, 2009 and 30th May, 2009.These documents are asked for because according to the Claimant, the Respondenthas denied involvement of IMG in the drafting, reviewing and negotiations of variouscontracts, including the Second BCCI WSGI MRLA. The Respondent however has notdenied that IMG was appointed by the Respondent and was advising the respondent.It also accepts that IMG was not Mr. Lalit Mody's personal advisor. (Paragraphs 8,8.1 and 8.3 of the Rejoinder). In view thereof, it is not necessary to direct theRespondent to disclose these documents."(emphasis supplied)72. Despite this finding of the Tribunal, and recording the fact that IMG wasappointed by BCCI, was advising them, and accepting that IMG was not Lalit Modi'spersonal adviser, in paragraph 38 of the Majority Award, the Tribunal records that inthe present case it is the case of BCCI that Mr. Paul Manning was taking instructionsfrom and reporting exclusively to Mr. Modi. The Majority Award thereafter goes on tohold that looking at the facts of the present case, the knowledge of Mr.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Manning cannot be attributed to BCCI and nor can it besaid that BCCI was aware of Mr. Modi's actions. It also holds that IMG acted on theinstructions of Mr. Modi as the Chairman of the IPL Governing Council and the locallegal team assisting him. There was no material before the Tribunal to show thatBCCI and its office bearers were aware of the disputed transactions or were consultedby IMG for preparing these Agreements, was the finding. For the sake ofconvenience, paragraph 38 of the Majority Award is reproduced hereunder:38. The Claimant contends that Mr. Modi acted throughout on behalf of theRespondent. The Agreements in question were drafted by International ManagementGroup (IMG), an agency with global expertise in sports media rights engaged by theWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/38Respondent to assist in the organisation of IPL. Particularly it was drafted by Mr.Paul Manning of IMG who had complete knowledge of the contentious clauses. Theknowledge of Mr. Paul Manning can be attributed to BCCI. The Claimant has reliedin this connection on the cases of Bradley v. Riches (1878) 9 Ch.D.189 which statesthat a solicitor can be presumed to have communicated to his client the facts whichhe ought to have made known. It is however, stated in the said authority that this issubject to exceptions. (cf. also Brohmo Dutt v. Dharmi Das Ghose (1898.) ILR 26 Cal.381). Both these cases deal with attorney-client relationship. In the present case, it isthe case of the Respondent that Mr. Manning was taking instructions from andreporting exclusively to Mr. Modi. Looking to the facts in the present case theknowledge of Mr. Manning cannot be attributed to the Respondent. Nor can it be saidthat the Respondent was aware of Mr. Modi's actions. Simply because IMG wasengaged inter alia, to prepare these Agreements, it does not necessarily lead to theconclusion that the Respondent was aware of all the Agreements so drafted and theirterms. IMG acted on the instructions of Mr. Modi as the chairman of IPL GoverningCouncil and the local legal team assisting him. There is no material before us to showthat the Respondent and its office bearers were aware carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx ofthe disputed transactions or were consulted by IMG for preparing these agreements.(emphasis supplied)73. I fail to understand how the Tribunal in the Majority Award has come to thesefindings when BCCI had conceded before the Tribunal on 3rd April 2017 that BCCIhad engaged IMG (who admittedly drafted all the Agreements of 2009) and that IMGwas not Mr. Lalit Modi's personal adviser. In my view, the findings of the Tribunal inparagraph 38 of the Majority Award are diametrically opposite to what is stated in itsorder on 3rd April 2017. As can be seen from the reproduction of the order dated 3rdApril 2017, the Tribunal was of the view that since BCCI accepted that IMG wasappointed by it, and the fact that it was not Lalit Modi's personal adviser, theTribunal thought it unnecessary to direct BCCI to produce the documents sought forby WSGI in relation to the 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA between 15th March 2009 and30th May 2009. Despite this, the Tribunal now holds that it is BCCI's case that Mr.Manning was taking instructions from and reporting exclusively to Mr. Lalit Modi. Itwas this very fact which WSGI wanted to disprove that it sought the production ofthose documents. Once the Tribunal recorded the statement of BCCI that IMG (Mr.Paul Manning being a part thereof) was appointed by BCCI and was advising BCCIand was not Mr. Lalit Modi's personal adviser, how carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx theTribunal has come to the conclusion that Mr. Paul Manning was taking instructionsfrom and reporting exclusively to Mr. Lalit Modi, is beyond my comprehension. Infact, this aspect has also been considered in the Minority Award at paragraphs 140 to142 thereof which reads thus:-"140) The Claimant had relied upon Bradley v Riches [(1878) 9 CHD; Pg 189 at195-197] as well as Brahmo Dutt v Dharmi Das Ghose [(1898) ILR 26 Cal 381; Para 8,World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/3921-25] wherein the Court rejected the contention that notice to the attorney is notnotice to the party and held that "the knowledge of the solicitor was the imputedknowledge of the client." The Courts have held that a client has constructive notice ofwhat is known to his Solicitor. The doctrine laid down was:"my solicitor is alter ego; he is myself; I stand in precisely the same position as hedoes in the transaction, and therefore his knowledge is my knowledge; and it wouldbe a monstrous injustice that I should have the advantage of what he knows withoutthe disadvantage. "Applying the above doctrine to the present case, unless the Respondent establishesthat Mr. Manning was the lawyer of Mr. Modi (and not the Respondent), and thatMr. Manning was produced before the Tribunal to depose that he had no knowledgeabout the transactions / Agreements, I would be inclined to take the view that he hadknowledge of all the transactions, had drafted all the Agreements executed on 15March 2009 and 25 March 2009 and since he was the lawyer for the Respondent, hisknowledge should be treated as knowledge of the Respondent. The fact that Mr.Manning was not the lawyer of Mr. Modi but of the Respondent is something that theRespondent has already accepted while rejecting the Claimant's request for discoveryon the submission of the Respondent, the Tribunal had held that: 'The Respondenthowever has not denied that IMG was appointed by the Respondent and was advisingthe Respondent. It also accepts that IMG was not Mr. Lalit Modi's personaL adviser.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx141) Not only that Mr. Manning was aware, the records show that on 11 April 2009,Mr. Modi sent an email with a copy of the 2nd BCCI MSM MRLA dated 25 March2009 to Ms. Akhila Kaushik, Mr. Shashank Manohar, Mr. N. Srinivasan, Mr. SundarRaman and Mr. Prasanna Kannan. This email falsifies the case of fraud andsuppression raised by the Respondent. The MRLA was sent to the President,Secretary, in house legal head and COO. Anybody could have gone through it andasked for more information and referred Agreements. However, in evidence, itemerges that the Secretary had not even cared to read the Agreement. However, inevidence, it emerges that the Secretary had not even cared to read the Agreement.[Shown Vol.l, page 465 (E-mail dated 11 1 11 April 2009 from Mr. Lalit Modi &l addressed to anumber of people including yourself attaching a copy of 2nd BCCI -- MSA1 A1RLA).

From this email, it appears that a copy of the agreement was sent amongstothers to me also. However, I did not read it at all because prior to this in order toWorld Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/40raise invoices I think Lalit Modi was asked for a copy of this agreement. No responsewas received from him and I may have written to Mr. Sundar Raman expressingdisappointment that there was no response. This was followed, I remember by a mailfrom Mr. Lalit Modi copied to a lot of people and then I think Mr. Manoharintervened who was the then President and after that this mail was sent. I vaguelyremember it. By that time, I was no more interested and therefore did not bother toread it."I find this difficult to believe. The Agreement was in his possession, but still he maintains that he didnot read it or only read select parts of it. Given the importance of the document, it cannot beaccepted that the same as not even read.carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx142) On the same day, Mr. N Srinavasan, RW-4, signed as a deponent to an Affidavit in CS (OS) No633/2009 before the Delhi High Court in a case titled- MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Ltd versus MrQW Naqvi and Another. The Affidavit stated that the said Mr Srinivasan was authorised andcompetent to swear and depose the Affidavit and that he was aware of the agreement entered intobetween MSM and the Respondent dated 25 March 2009 and he had read and perused the contentsthereof. Despite the affidavit, having sworn by him, his cross examination shows an attempt todistance himself from it and accepted having a copy of Agreement after being confronted withdocuments:''Q.9. Do you remember filing this affidavit in Delhi High Court on behalf of BCCI asHon. Secretary of BCCI in the Suit filed by MSM against one Mr. Q.N. Naqvi & Anr ?Ans. If I have signed it, I have filed it. ""Q.10. I put it to you therefore that your answer to Q. 7 is incorrect as you had readand perused the contents of the 2nd BCCI - MSM MRLA by 11th April 2009 at thelatest. What do you have to say?Ans. I remember that there was some dispute between Sony and somebody, may bethe person mentioned here, whether Sony had rights or not, so my President askedme to go and affirm it and when I have stated that I had perused the agreement, itwould be limited to whether Sony had the rights and I was instructed by myPresident to file this Affidavit. "The Affidavit is clear and especially given the receipt of the 11 April 2009 and the uncontrovertedevidence we cannot accept the RW- 4's version that he was not aware of the terms of the agreement.I cannot ignore the fact that the agreement was in fact in his possession and every person cansubsequently deny knowledge of a document received by him by saying he did not read it or onlyread select parts of it. This cannot be accepted. The 2nd BCCI-WSGI MRLA, which admittedly wasknown to all, contained references to the Facilitation Deed as well."World Sport Group(India) Pvt Ltd vs Board Of Control For Cricket In ... on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135276246/41(emphasis supplied) carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx74. Once again, at the cost of repetition, I must emphasize that I haven't reproduced parts of theMinority Award to examine which view is correct but to only see whether material evidence, andwhich would go to the root of the matter, has been missed in the Majority Award. When onecompares the Majority Award with the Minority Award, I have no hesitation in holding that hugechunks of important evidence are missed out and/or not even referred to in the Majority Award.Such an Award, with the greatest of respect to the Arbitrators who passed the Majority Award,cannot be allowed to stand.75. In view of the discussion above, the Petition succeeds and is allowed in terms of prayer clause (a)which reads thus:"a. The Majority Award dated 13 July 2020 be set aside under Section 34 of the Arbitration andConciliation Act, 1996"76. Considering that the Majority Award has been set aside on the ground that it fails to take intoconsideration material evidence which would have a bearing on the outcome of the dispute betweenthe parties, I direct that in terms of Section 43(4) of the Arbitration Act, if either party chooses toonce again invoke arbitration or commence fresh proceedings, the period between thecommencement of the above arbitration, till today, shall be excluded in computing the timeprescribed by the carbpl.6451.2020 bcci.docx Limitation Act, 1963 for commencement ofproceedings (including Arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted.77.
