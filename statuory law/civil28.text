Section 70 is based on the premise that something was done by one party for another and that the work so done voluntarily, was accepted by the other. Therefore, as a corollary, the plea that there was a subsisting contract in the nature of business transactions, is antithetic to the very essence of section 70. This is why section 70 forms part of Chapter V of the Indian Contract Act, which is titled as “Of certain relations resembling those created by contract”.The respondents have admitted that the moneys as claimed by the appellant­-plaintiff were either paid by the plaintiff or flown out of the plaintiff’s account into their own account. Therefore, the onus was actually on the respondents to prove either a discharge by way of settlement of accounts or the gratuitous nature of the payment. The respondents miserably failed to discharge the onus of proof so cast upon them. Hence, the plaintiff-­appellant is entitled to a decree despite a few discrepancies in her evidence, especially when the discrepancies have no bearing upon the payment/flow of monies from the plaintiff to the defendants.Case Number : Civil Appeal Nos. 7750­7751 of 2021 (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.12558­12559 of 2018)Hon’ble Mr. Justice V.
