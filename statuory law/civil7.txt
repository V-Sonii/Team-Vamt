The main contention of learned counsel for the applicant/respondent no.12 is that since theCompany's Act, 1956 has been repealed by the new Act i.e. The Companies's Act, 2013 (hereinafterreferred to as "the Act 2013") and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (hereinafter referred toas "the IBC") has been enacted, therefore, by virtue of Section 434(1)(c) of the Act, 2013 read withRule 5 of the Companies (Transfer of pending proceedings) Rules, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as"the Transfer Rules, 2016"), the present Company petition is not maintainable before this Court andit has to be transferred to the National Company Law Tribunal (for short "NCLT") constituted underSection 408 read with Section 410 of the Act 2013.4. This petition was heard on several occasions and detailed orders including the orders dated29.09.2020, 02.12.02020 and 20.01.2021 were passed incorporating the submissions of learnedcounsels for the parties.5.

Learned counsel for the applicant/respondent no.12 has submitted as under :-Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/2(A) In view of Section 408, 410 and 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, read with the 5th proviso, theHigh Court has no jurisdiction to entertain or proceed with a Company Petition inasmuch as thejurisdiction in Company Petition for winding up on the ground of inability to pay tax is maintainableonly before the NCLT. Reliance is place on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated22.01.2019 in Civil Appeal No.818 of 2018 (Forech India Ltd. Vs. Edelweiss Assets ReconstructionCo. Ltd.) (paras 12 and 17).(B) As per Rule 5 of the Companies (Transfer of Pending Proceedings) Rules, 2016, enacted byNotification dated 07.12.2016 as amended by 2nd amendment Notification dated 29.06.2017, allpetitions relating to winding up under Clause (e) of Section 433 of the Companies Act, 1946 on theground of inability to pay debts, pending before the High Court as on 15.12.2016 stood transferred tothe NCLT. Therefore, this Court should also transfer the present petition to NCLT.(C) It is admitted that the order dated 28.05.2019 in PIL No.12324 of 2003 was passed by theDivision Bench with the consent of the parties. The relevant portion of paragraph-47 of the aforesaidorder dated 28.05.2019, reads as under:"(II) Since it is an old matter, Registry of this Court now shall register a Winding Up CompanyPetition and place this matter before Company Judge so that Court may proceed in the matter byconsidering claims of the parties The property, movable or immovable, in the custody of DistrictAdministration or the Registrar General etc., shall be taken in custody by Company Judge or if sodirected, shall be handed over to Official Liquidator for maintenance of property and dealing withthe same in the manner as directed by Company Judge in the winding up petition.(III) Till further order is passed by Company Judge, Registrar General is directed to keep the entiremoney, as detailed in para 38 of this order, in a fixed deposit and thereafter it shall be dealt with inthe manner as directed by Company Judge.(IV) Claim of M/s Pushpa Petroleum is said to be founded on a compromise between the said Firmand M/s SBPL dated 04.04.2005.

Now company petition can be filed bythe petitioner only before the NCLT in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.(E) In any case, this court cannot proceed with the present company petition and instead the mattershould be remitted to the NCLT under Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013.7.

Sahara India FinancialCorporation Ltd., 2019 (3) ADJ 540 (LB).(i) A company petition cannot be automatically transferred by the High Court to the Tribunal underSection 434 (1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 rather third proviso to Rule 5 of the Companies(Transfer of Pending Proceedings) Rules, 2016 as amended by the Second Amendment Rules videGSR 732(E) dated 29.06.2017 leaves the discretion with the court where the winding up proceedingsare pending to transfer it or not to transfer it to the Tribunal.

The petitioners filed a writ petition before Hon'ble Supreme Court under Article 32 of theConstitution of India bringing to its notice that how various consumers, distributors and dealers ofthe respondent no.12 i.e. M/s. S.B. Petroleum Ltd., spread in nine states, namely, Madhya Pradesh,Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthana, Bihar, Delhi and Punjab were takenfor a ride and cheated by collection of crores of rupees and syphoned it by acquiring personalproperties. The matter was heard by Hon'ble Supreme Court for several years and ultimately thewrit petition was disposed of by order dated 13.01.2003 as under :-"This writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was filed in public interest,approximately six years earlier, bringing to the notice of this Court how various consumers,distributors and dealers of respondent No. 12 -M/s. S.B. Petroleum Ltd. spread in nine States,namely Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar,Delhi, Punjab were taken for a ride and cheated by collection of crores of rupees. According to thepetitioners crores of rupees were syphoned and personal properties acquired. Various orders werepassed by this Court from time to time against respondent. 12-Company and its Managing Directorand his family members and also other Directors.

We have been informed by Shri Altaf Ahmad, learned Additional Solicitor General that 22chargesheets were filed on 24th December, 1999 before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate III,Lucknow. Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that primarily on account of thenon-cooperation of the accused charges have not been framed. We, however, refrain fromexpressing any opinion except observing that all concerned are directed to cooperate in theexpeditious disposal of the cases that have been initiated as a result of directions issued in thismatter.Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/6Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not think it possible for this Court toeither examine from time to time the progress of the criminal cases so as to ensure its expeditiousdisposal and to also go into the factual details of a large number of consumers and their rights, andalso the rights, if any, of dealers/distributors. We may note that though large sums have beenrefunded, according to respondent no.12, to the consumers but it seems that still there may be largenumber of consumers to get the refunds.

A SpecialCommissioner was also appointed who carried out tremendous job before the assets may be soldand the proceeds may be distributed amongst the claimants/petitioners, the aforesaid PIL wasdisposed of by a detailed order dated 28.05.2019. The directions given by the Division Bench in theaforesaid PIL No.12324 of 2003 while disposing of the aforesaid PIL no.12324 of 2003 by orderdated 28.05.2019, are as under :-"(I) CBI Court shall proceed to decide the cases pending before it ensuring hearing on day to daybasis. It should endeavor to complete trial in all these cases expeditiously since sufficient time hasalready elapsed.

Pursuant to the direction of the Division Bench of this Court in para 47(II)/(III)/(IV) of theorder dated 28.05.2019 in the aforesaid PIL No.12324 of 2003 the present petition has beenregistered and listed before me as Company Judge nominated by Hon'ble the Chief Justice by orderdated 17.06.2020 on administrative side. This is how the present company petition has came upbefore this court for consideration.11. However, the present case could not be proceeded to reach the logical ends on account of furtherobstructions created by the applicants/respondent no.12 by making successive application beingCivil Misc. Application No.48 dated 09.09.2019, Civil Misc. Application No. 49 dated 30.11.2019Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/13and Civil Misc. Application No.52 dated 30.07.2020 which are being hereby decided.Discussion and Findings12. I have carefully considered the submissions of learned counsels for the parties and perused therecords of the case.13. It is undisputed that the entire proceedings against the applicants/respondent no.12 and theirproperties took place pursuant to the directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated13.01.2003 in Writ Petition (c) No.752 of 1996, filed by the petitioner herein under Article 32 of theConstitution of India. The direction given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the order dated13.01.2003, has already been reproduced above. It is also admitted to the applicants/respondentno.12 that the Special Commissioner, in terms of the aforequoted order of Hon'ble Supreme Courtand pursuant to the orders passed by the High Court from time to time in the aforesaid PILno.12324 of 2003, took effective steps and did the needful to adjudicate the claim.14. Now, mainly the process of selling the assets and distribution of proceeds amongst the claimantsin adjudication of their claims, is left. It appears that under the facts and circumstances of the casethe Division Bench thought it fit to provide by order dated 28.05.2019 that the PIL may now beconverted and registered as a winding up company petition so that the matter may reach to itslogical ends. Thus, the present case is not winding up proceedings under the Companies Act, 1956but it is a petition registered under the orders of the Division Bench dated 28.05.2019 in PILNo.12324 of 2003, which itself was the result of order of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 13.01.2003,passed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in Writ Petition (c) No.758 of 1996.15. It has been admitted by learned counsel for the applicant/respondent no.12 that the aforesaidPIL No.12324 of 2003 was converted into the present company petition by order dated 28.05.2019on "no objection" filed by all the contesting parties including the petitioners and theapplicants/respondent no.12. Thus, the aforesaid PIL was converted into the present petition withthe consent of the applicants/ respondent no.12. Consequently, the respondents can not raiseobjection that the present company petition can not be adjudicated by the High Court. Withoutprejudice to the above, it is further relevant to mention that neither the applications presently underconsideration filed by the applicants/respondent no.12 have disclosed any reason for transfer of thepresent petition to NCLT nor learned counsel for the applicants/respondent no.12 has raised anycontention disclosing reasons for transfer, except that the present petition deserves to be transferredto the NCLT under the Transfer Rules, 2016. There is no doubt that the second proviso to Section434(1)(c) provides that any party to winding up proceedings pending before any Court immediatelybefore the commencement of IBC, may file an application for transfer of such proceedings and theCourt may transfer all such proceedings to the NCLT. However, the said proviso does not mandatethat the proceedings would automatically stands transferred rather it leaves the decision with theCourt where the winding up proceedings are pending, to transfer the same or not to transfer thesame. The applications of the applicants/respondent no.12 do not even disclose specifically as towhy power to transfer the winding up petition should be exercised by this Court and the winding uppetition should be transferred, particularly when after journey of about 25 years the matter is nowJagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/14about to reach to its logical end. Similar is the view taken by Lucknow Bench of this Court in thecase of Reserve Bank of India a Statutory Body Vs. Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd. 2019 3ADJ 540(LB)(para 43,51,53,56,57 & 58). The judgment of this Court in the case of SaumyaCo-operative Housing Society Vs. State of U.P., 2019 (143) RD relied by learned counsel for theapplicants/respondent no.12 laying down the principle that jurisdiction can not be conferred on aCourt by consent, is distinguishable on facts of the present case. Reasons in this regard have alreadybeen stated in foregoing paragraphs. It would be relevant to mention at the cost of repetition thatthe present petition has come into existence on account of the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Courtdated 13.01.2003 in Writ Petition (c) No.758 of 1996 followed by order of the Division Bench of thisCourt dated 28.05.2019 in PIL No.12324 of 2003.16. It would not be out of place to mention that pursuant to the direction of Hon'ble Supreme Courtparticularly those given in paragraphs g, h, i and l of the order dated 13.01.2003, the SpecialCommissioner took up the entire matter and after issuance of notices publicised in largely circulatednews papers, adjudicated the claims. An interim report dated 11.01.2006 was submitted by theSpecial Commissioner, namely, Sri Justice R.A. Sharma (Retd.) and thereafter a supplementary finalreport dated 05.09.2006 was also submitted. The interim report dated 11.01.2006 is a very detailedreport which discloses various steps taken by the Special Commissioner pursuant to the orders ofHon'ble Supreme Court and also the Division Bench of this Court in the aforesaid PIL No.12324 of2003.17. In the supplementary final report the Special Commissioner concluded as under :-"By his orders dated 28.03.2006, the Special Commissioner has decided 153 claims. The judgmentsof the decided claims are contained in two volumes. All these judgments have been filed before thisHon'ble Court.In the final report, it was mentioned that five cases; two from U.P. and three from Maharashtra,have been adjourned from time to time at the request of the parties and are fixed in April and June,2006. Now, these five cases have also been decided. There were also five highly belated claims,which were left undecided. These claims have also been decided.The Special Commissioner has awarded Rs. 9,42,65,989/- + Rs. 1,68,82,865/- = Rs. 11,11,48,854/-to the claimants whose claims have been allowed.As all the pending claims have been decided by the Special Commissioner, his judicial work is over.Sale of the properties, mentioned in the Special Commissioner's order dated 28.03.2006, which ispart of volume I of the judgments, and payment of the amount to the claimants whose claims havebeen decreed are the only work left. The sale of the properties is likely to take time, as the orders ofthe Special Commissioner have been challenged.This report is, accordingly, submitted to bring on record the position with regard to the disposal ofthe claims filed before the Special Commissioner."Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/1518. Thereafter, on account of death of Sri Justice R.A. Sharma, by order of the Division Bench thisCourt Sri Justice R.R.K. Trivedi (Retd.) was appointed as a Special Commissioner on 06.08.2013 tocarry out the orders of Hon'ble Court. A lot of amount has been collected which are kept in threebank accounts and details of which have been given by Sri Justice R.R.K. Trivedi (Retd.) in hisapplication dated June 10, 2020. The amounts is available in the bank in the form of FDRs. areabout 1.25 crores.19. The facts as briefly noted above clearly indicates that such steps have already been taken whichare irreversible. Therefore, in terms of the provisions of Section 434 (c) of the Companies Act, 2013read with Rule 5 of the Transfers Rules, 2016, the transfer applications in question filed by theapplicants/respondent no.12 deserve to be rejected.20. In the case of Action Ispat and Power Private Limited Vs. Shyam Metalics and Energey Limited(2021) 2 SCC 641 (para 14 to 26) Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the provisions of Section434(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Transfer Rules 2016 and held that transfer of petitionpending in High Court to NCLT can be made when no irreversible steps towards winding up of theCompany have otherwise taken place. Therefore, even in view of the law laid down by Hon'bleSupreme Court the present company petition need not to be transferred to the NCLT.21. For all the reasons aforestated, the Civil Misc. Application No.48 of 2019 dated 09.09.2019, CivilMisc. Application No. 49 of 2019 dated 30.11.2019 and Civil Misc. Application No.52 of 2020 dated30.07.2020, filed by the applicants/ respondent No.12 are hereby rejected.22. The matter is released and be listed on 25.03.2022 before the appropriate court.Order Date :- 16.3.2022/vkg    Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad ... vs Union Of India And Others on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140539361/16
