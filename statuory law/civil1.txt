Appeal from the judgment anddecree dated May 23, 1961 of e Punjab High Court, Circuit Bench at Delhi in Regular Second appealNo. 43-D of 1956.N. N. Keswani, for the appellant.V. A. Seyid Muhammad and S. P. Nayar, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court wasdelivered by Grover, L This is an appeal by certificate from a judgment and decree of the PunjabHigh Court (Circuit Bench, Delhi) by which the suit filed by the appellant for a declaration that theorder dated May 26, 1951 directing his removal from service was wrongful, illegal and void and thathe still continued to be in the service of the respondent as Supervisor, Army Ordnance Corps.According to the allegations in the plaint the appellant was appointed by the Governor-General inJuly 1942 as Supervisor, Army Ordnance Corps which, according to him, was a civil post under theCrown in India. In the months of September and October, 1950 the appellant was served withchargesheets by the Ordnance Officer, Administration, Shakurbasti, Delhi State, where he wasposted at that time calling upon him to submit his defence to the charges of making serious falseLekh Raj Khurana vs Union Of India on 3 March, 1971Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1930667/2allegations against his superior officer Maj. H. S. Dhillon. The appellant asked for grant of time forsubmitting his defence and be also demanded copies of certain documents etc to prove his case. OnMay 26, 1951 while this inquiry was pending he was served with an order by the Ordnance Officer,Administration, Shakur- basti, Delhi which was as follows--"Under instructions received from Army Head- quarters you are hereby given onemonth's notice of discharge with immediate effect, services being no longer required.Your services will be terminated on 25th June, 1951".The appellant challenged the legality of the above order principally on the ground that it had beenpassed by an officer who was subordinate to the authority who appointed him and that no inquiry"as required by Fundamental Rules and under the provisions of the Constitution of India" had beenheld in the matter of allegations against him and that no adequate opportunity had been afforded tohim of defending himself or of show-ing cause against the action proposed to be taken. He all raised the question of the order beingvitiated by mala fid In the written statement filed by the Union of India it was stat that the appellanthad been appointed as a Labour Supervisor he Extra Temporary Establishment by the COO/OrdnanOfficer Incharge, Ammunition Depot, Kasubegu under t authority of Financial Regulations, India,Part 1, Volume and not by the Governor General. It was pleaded, inter all that it was decided by theGovernment of India vide Army Headquarter's letter dated May, 25, 1951 to terminate the servicesby serving one month's notice. Consequently a notice of discharge from the service was given to himby the Ordnance Officer, Administration, who was competent to serve the notice on him under theauthority of the Army Order No. 1202/1943 read in conjunction with 'Financial Regulations referredto before. The sole material issue which was framed was whether the order dated May 26, 1951removing the appellant from service was illegal, wrong, void, ultra vires and inoperative. The trialjudge held that Art. 311 of the Constitution was applicable to the case of the appellant and that hisremoval had not been ordered by the appointing authority. The suit was decreed. respondentpreferred an appeal which was decided by the Additional District Judge, Delhi. It :Was held by himthat Art. 311 was not applicable to the appellant as he held a post connected with defence. Accordingto the learned judge the appellant's services were terminated under Rule 5 of the Civilians inDefence (Temporary Services) Rules, 1949, hereinafter called the 'Rules'. It was found that the orderterminating the services had been passed by the proper authority. The appeal was allowed and thesuit was dismissed. The appellant appealed to the High Court which was dismissed. His appeal washeard along with certain other appeals in which similar points were involved. It was found that thesalary of the appellant was paid out of the estimates of the Mnistry of Defence and he was intimatelyconnected with the defence of the country not as a combatant but as a person holding a post theobject of which was exclusively to serve the Military Department. In the opinion of the High' CourtArticles 309 and 310 were applicable to the case of the appellant but Article 311 was inapplicable. Onthe question whether the services of the appellant were terminated without complying with the rulesthe High Court expressed the view that the breach of such rules did not give the aggrieved party aright to go to the court Reliance in that connection was placed on the decision of the Privy Council inR. Venkatarao v.Lekh Raj Khurana vs Union Of India on 3 March, 1971Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1930667/3Secretary of State(1) and certain other cases in which that decision was followed. In the case of theappellant the only other point which appears to have appear to have been argued on his behalf andwhich was decided by the High Court related to the allegation of mala fides. The decision wentagainst him on that, point.The question whether the case of the appellant was governed by Art. 311 of the Constitution standsconcluded by two decisions of this court. In Jagatrai Mahinchand Ajwani v. Union of India(2) it washeld that an Engineer in the Military Service who was drawing these salary from the DefenceEstimates could not claim the protection of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. In that case also theappellant was found to have held a post connected with Defence as in the present case. This decisionwas followed in S. P. Bell v. Union of India (3). Both these decisions fully cover the case of theappellant so far as the applicability of Art. 3 1 1 is concerned.Learned counsel for the appellant sought to argue that since the appellant was admittedly governedby the rules which framed under s. 241(2) 'of the Government of India Act 1935 he was entitled tothe protection of s. 240 of that Act. Chapter I of Part 10 of that Act related to the Defence Services.According to ss. 239, 235, 236 and 237 were applicable to persons who not being members of HisMajest's Forces held or had held posts in India connected with the equipment or administration ofthose forces or otherwise connected with Defence as they applied in relation to persons who were orhad been members of those forces. Section 240, to the extent it is material was in the followingterms:-"240(1) Except as expressly provided by this Act, every person who is a member of acivil service of the Crown in India, or holds any civil post under the Crown in India,holds office during His Majesty's pleasure. (2) No such' person as aforesaid shall bedismissed from the service of His Majesty by any authority subordinate to that bywhich he was appointed.(3) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he hasbeen given a reason able opportunity or showing cause against the action proposed tobe taken in regard to him :(1) A.I.R. (1937) P.C. 31.(3) C, A 1918 of 1966 dt. 8-3-68. 14-L1100sup.CI/72 (2) C. A. 1185 of 1965 dt. 6-2-67.Provided................ Section 241 provided for recruitment and conditions of service.On behalf of the appellant it was contended that since his conditions of service were governed by therules which were framed under the above section, s.240 was clearly applicable and his services couldnot have been terminated in terms of subs. (2) of that section by any authority subordinate to thatby which he was appointed nor could he be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given areasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.At no stage of the proceedings in the courts below the appellant relied on s. 240 of the GovernmentLekh Raj Khurana vs Union Of India on 3 March, 1971Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1930667/4of India Act and rightly so because the order of his discharge or termination of service was madeafter the Constitution had come into force. It was apparently for that reason. that protection wassought from Art 311 and not s. 240 of the Government of India Act 1935. We see no reason orjustification in the present case for determining whether a person holding a civilian post which isconnected with the defence and for which he is paid salary and emoluments from the DefenceEstimates would be governed by the provisions of section 240 of the Government of India Act if theprovisions of that Act were not applicable to the case of such a servant.The next question is whether rule 5 of the Rules was applique able and whether the appellant couldclaim the benefit of that rule. It provided, inter-alia, that the service of a temporary governmentservant who is not in quasi-permanent service shall be liable to termination at any time by notice inwriting given either by the", government servant to the appointing authority or by the appointingauthority to the government servant. The view of the High Court that the rules were not justifiablecannot be sustained as the decision of the Privy Council in Venkatarao's case (supra) and the othercases following that view have not been accepted as laying down the law correctly by this court. Ithas been held that the breach of a statutory rule in relation to the conditions of service would entitlethe government servant to have recourse to the court for redress; vide The State of Uttar Pradesh &Others v. Ajodhya Prasad(1) and State of Mysore v. M. R. Bellary(1). Now Exhibit P. 3 which is aletter dated May 26, 1951 and which was produced by the appellant himself shows that one monthsnotice of discharge was given by the ordnance Officer, Administration, under instructions receivedfrom the Army Headquarters. A copy of another letter Exht. P-2 dated May 27, 1951 was producedaccording to which it had been decided by the Government (1) [1951] 2 S.C.R.671.(2) [1964] 7 S.C.R.471.of India that the services of the appellant be terminated by giving him one month's notice. It is truethat the origin of that letter was not produced although it had been summoned by the appellant It isat least clear that the. Ordnance Officer, Administration, had served the notice of discharge underinstructions from the Army Headquarters. In this view of the matter there is no substance in thecontention raised on behalf of the appellant that the order of discharge had not been made by theappointing authority. At any rate before the High Court there was no challenge to the finding of thelearned District Judge on the point and a question of fact cannot be allowed to be reopened at thisstage. The learned counsel for the appellant attempted to reopen the finding on the question of malafides and also invoked the rule of natural Justice in so far as the appellant had not been afforded anyopportunity of showing cause against his discharge or termination of services. In the appeal beforethis Court the finding on the point of mala fides must be accepted as final and the appellant cannotbe allowed to reagitate that matter. As regards the applicability of the rule of natural justice it hasnot been shown to us how under the general law of master and servant, in the absence of anyprotection conferred by Article 311 of the Constitution such a rule can be invoked. The appeal failsand it is dismissed but in view of the cir- cumstances we leave the parties to bear their own costs inthis Court.R.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.Lekh Raj Khurana vs Union Of India on 3 March, 1971Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1930667/5
