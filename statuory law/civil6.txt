The factual matrix of the case, in brief, is that opposite party no.1-the IndianBureau of Mines, which was established in the year 1948, as a multidisciplinarygovernmental organization under the Department of Mines, Ministry of Mines,Government of India, is engaged in the promotion of conservation, scientificdevelopment of mineral resources and protection of environment in mines other thancoal, petroleum and natural gas, atomic minerals and minor minerals.Opposite party no.1 is also tasked with maintaining the National Mineral Inventory, and approvingmining plans, closure of operations and the conservation of mineral material, as the nationalregulator for State Governments.2.1 Opposite party no.2-State of Odisha represented through the Directorate of Mines, is functioningunder the administrative control of Steel & Mines Department of Odisha. The major functions of theDirectorate are- administration of mines & minerals, processing of mineral concession applications,collection // 4 // of mineral revenue, prevention & control of illegal mining & smuggling ofminerals, enforcement of statutory provisions for exploration of minerals, peripheral developmentof mining areas, chemical analysis of ores & minerals etc. As such, opposite party no.2 is responsiblefor implementation of the ASP (Average Sale Price) published by opposite party no.1 and collectionof royalties and other contributions from mining companies based on the same.2.2 Opposite party no.3 is the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, which is the principal organof the Union of India for legislation, policy formulation and administration of mines and minerals inthe country. It has also the duty to issue clarifications and guidelines on the interpretation of andmanner of implementation of various mining laws, including rules and regulations, which will havebearing on mining operations and transactions across the country.2.3 Pursuant to reforms initiated by the Government of India in July, 1991 in the fiscal, // 5 //industrial and trade regimes in force in the country, the National Mineral Policy was announced inMarch, 1993. The National Mineral Policy recognized the need for encouraging private investmentand for attracting state of the art technology in the mineral sector paving the wave of private sectorin the exploration and mining activities in India. It was in furtherance of the objectives of the saidNational Mineral Policy, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1997 (for short"MMDR Act, 1957"), the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for short "MCR, 1960") and the MineralConservation and Development Rules, 1988 (for short "MCDR, 1988"), having been framed underthe MMDR Act, 1957, have been modified from time to time to deliver a fair concession regime forAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/2mining development in India and to invite private sector investment in the country. With theaforementioned objectives of ensuring grater private sector participation in the mining sector,opposite party no.3 introduced (1) Minerals (Other than Atomic and Hydro Carbons EnergyMinerals) Concession Rules, 2016 (for short "MCR, 2016"), which, unlike the // 6 // earlier MCR,provides for mechanisms for grant of concessions through auction, transfer of concessions as well assaving clauses to protect the rights of mineral concession licensees under the old regime, (2) TheMineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2017 (MCDR, 2017) which deals with the rights ofthe reconnaissance or prospecting licensees or mining leaseholders and (3) Mineral Auction(Amendment) Rules, 2017, which provides for greater flexibility in the auction process to enhanceparticipation in auctions and ensuring that such auctions are successful. 2.4 In this backdrop of thedevelopment of law, the Government of Odisha, in exercise of power conferred under Section 10B ofthe MMDR Act, 1957 read with Mineral (Auction) Rules, 2015, issued a Notice Inviting Tender("NIT") for auction of mining lease for iron ore and manganese minerals, the lease period of whichwas to expire on 31.03.2020 in terms of Section 8A(6) of the MMDR Act, 1957. The NIT invited bidsfor 12 mineral blocks of iron ore, two mineral blocks of // 7 // manganese and 6 mineral blocks foriron ore and manganese. These blocks included Jajang Iron Ore block, Nuagaon Iron Ore block,Narayanposhi Iron Ore and Manganese block and the Gonua Iron Ore block. The State Governmentissued detailed tender documents for each individual mining block and also published informationregarding Mine Block Summary, which contains the extracts from the Geological Study Report foreach mining block on the e-auction platform, and the same was accessible to all bidders. Thee-auction of the said blocks was conducted by the Government in accordance with the aforesaid NITon various dates. In the said e-auction, JSW Steel Ltd., the petitioner no.1 herein, submitted thehighest final offer for Jajang Iron Ore block, Nuagaon Iron Ore block, Narayanposhi Iron Ore andManganese block and the Gonua Iron Ore block and was declared as the 'Preferred Bidder' for grantof the aforementioned mining blocks by the Director of Mines, Odisha. Out of the said four blocks,Jajang and Nuagaon are non-captive mines and Narayanposhi and Gonua are captive mines. InMarch, 2020, in pursuance // 8 // of the deposit of the first installment of 10% upfront payment,the Government of Odisha issued Letters of Intent to the petitioner-company in respect of theaforementioned mining blocks in terms of Rule 10 of the Mineral (Auction) Rules, 2015.2.5 The MCR, 2016 was amended on 20.03.2020 by inserting a new Rule 12-A, which provided forimposition of additional conditions for commencement and continuation for production as perSection 4B of the MMDR Act, 1957. The newly inserted Rule 12A further provided that during thefirst two years, from the date of the execution of a new lease deed, the holder of a mining lease, towhom the order of vesting of the rights, approvals, clearances, licenses and the like have been issuedunder Section 8B of the MMDR Act, 1957, shall maintain such level of production so as to ensureminimum dispatch of eighty percent of the average of the annual production of two immediatelypreceding years on pro rata basis, failing which appropriate actions in accordance with the MineDevelopment and Production // 9 // Agreement ("MDPA") shall be initiated. In May, 2020, thevesting orders were issued by the State Government in favour of the petitioner-company in respectof the mining blocks, for which it was the preferred bidder, in terms of Rule 9(A)(1) of the MCR,2016.Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/32.6. On 24.06.2020, after payment of the second instalment of the upfront payment and furnishingof the Performance Bank Guarantee, the petitioner-company was declared as the 'Successful Bidder'.As a consequence thereof, MDPA was executed between the State Government and thepetitioner-company on 25.06.2020. In terms of the MDPA, after payment of third instalment of theupfront payment, the State of Odisha executed the mining lease deeds with the petitioner-companyin respect of Jajang Iron Ore block and Nuagaon Iron Ore block on 27.06.2020. Mining Operationsin the said mines were commenced on 01.07.2020. Thereby, in view of provisions contained in Rule12A(1) of MCR, 2016, the petitioner-company was to comply with the production and dispatch levelin // 10 // respect of Jajang and Nuagaon Mines. At the end of the first year of mining operations,the petitioner-company was imposed a penalty of Rs.696 crores on 07.09.2021 towards shortfall inmeeting the minimum dispatch targets from Jajang mines. The same was challenged before thisCourt in W.P.(C) No. 28232 of 2021, wherein the demand notice was directed to be kept in abeyancetill the disposal of the writ petition, vide order dated 27.09.2021. In view of the plummeting demandof iron ore in the international market from July, 2021, there was consequent fall in internationalprices of iron ore and thereby, there was a consequent decline in the exports of iron ore from theState of Odisha leading to an insignificant demand, particularly of low grade ore. 2.7. In view ofdwindling demand of iron ore in the international market and the consequent fall in internationalprices, the petitioner-company was compelled to undertake sale of its production at the pricediscovered at the e-auction so as to achieve the minimum dispatch as mandated under Rule 12A ofthe // 11 // MCR, 2016 and to avoid hefty penalties under the MDPA. In order to ensure that theprices at which the iron ore of various grades is sold in a transparent manner, thepetitioner-company started conducting e- auctions through the MSTC e-commerce platform of theGovernment of India. As such, the petitioner-company conducted the said auctions on elevenoccasions between 24.08.2021 and 12.12.2021 for iron ore from Jajang Mines. The price sodiscovered in the e-auction for the iron ore sold from Jajang Mines was also used for the sale ofcomparable grades of iron ore sold from Nuagaon Mines. As per requirements of Rule-45(7) of theMCDR, 2017 read with Form F-1, the petitioner- company has been duly submitting its monthlyreturns to opposite party no.1 and providing rectification and explanation as and when required inaccordance with guidelines formulated by Indian Bureau of Mines, Nagpur (central body) andpublished by opposite party no.3.// 12 // 2.8. On 16.12.2021, opposite party no.1 issued a violation-cum-show cause notice to thepetitioner- company in respect of its Jajang Iron Ore Mines and Nuagaon Iron Ore Mines in theState of Odisha for alleged violations of Rule 45(7) and Rule 45(8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017 directingto give reasons within 30 days from the date of issue of the notice as to (a) why all mining operationsand dispatches of the Mines should be not stopped; (b) why the petitioner should not be prosecutedunder the rules; and (c) recommend termination of the mining lease for suppression ormisrepresentation of information indicates abetment or connivance of illegal mining.2.9 When the matter thus stood, opposite party no.1 on the very same day, vide letter dated16.12.2021 addressed to the Director (Statistics) and In-charge MMS Division of the Indian Bureauof Mines, referring to the sale of various grades of iron ore by the petitioner- company from its ironore mines at Jajang and Nuagaon, had recommended that the ASP of the State of Odisha // 13 //may be calculated excluding the ex-mine price of the above mines as the same were allegedly not onAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/4"arm's length basis". In response to the violation-cum-show cause notice dated 16.12.2021, thepetitioner-company submitted its reply on 18.12.2021 in terms of Rule 45(7A) of the MCDR, 2017addressing to CCOM (MDRD) of the Indian Bureau of Mines, Nagpur, with a request that unless anduntil the said reply is considered, no decision may be taken to revise the ASP already publishedexcluding the domestic sale transactions of the lessee (petitioner-company herein) under the pretextthat the same were not qualifying sale transactions under Rule 45(8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017. Inaddition to the same, the petitioner-company furnished further reply on 27.12.2021 stating, interalia, that the notices do not fulfil the statutory conditions for issuance thereof and ex-facie do notshow any violation or other cause of action, for which action is contemplated therein. Opposite partyno.1 published the ASP for September, 2021 and October, 2021 on 30.11.2021 and 29.12.2021respectively and marked ASP for Iron Ore for the State of // 14 // Odisha as "P" or "Provisional" forfew grades, for which the published ASP was lower by more than 20% from the published ASP ofAugust, 2021. Instead of taking any decision on the reply of the petitioner-company to the notice ofshow-cause, opposite party no.1 proceeded to exclude the ex-mines price of the petitioner-companyfor the period in question and calculated and published the ASP for the State.2.10 At that point of time, the petitioner-company approached Delhi High Court by filing W.P.No.845 of 2022 on 12.01.2021 challenging the notice and seeking relief against issuance andimplementation of final ASP for September, 2021, October, 2021 and November, 2021 excluding theex-mine price of the petitioner- company's mines, but subsequently the said writ petition waswithdrawn on 17.01.2021 with a liberty to proceed before this Court.2.11 While deciding the replies dated 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021 given by the petitioner-company tothe notice of show-cause, opposite party no.1 proceeded to // 15 // declare and publish the ASP forthe months of September, 2021 and October, 2021 excluding the ex mine price of thepetitioner-company at 9 PM on 12.01.2022. Hence this writ petition.3. Dr. A.M. Singhvi and Mr. G. Jain, learned Senior Counsel appearing along with Mr. S.S. Mohanty,learned counsel for the petitioners urged before this Court that the impugned decision dated12.01.2022, whereby the opposite party no.1 has proceeded to publish the revised/final ASP forSeptember, 2021 and October, 2021 excluding the ex-mine prices of the petitioner-company, suffersfrom illegality, failure to follow due process of law, principle of natural justice, jurisdictional errorand predetermined mindset, and thereby violates Articles 14 and 19 (i) (g) of the Constitution ofIndia. He emphatically contended that the impugned decision and publication of ASP was issuedwithout considering the replies dated 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021 submitted by thepetitioner-company, pursuant to show-cause notice dated 16.10.2021, and // 16 // without passingany specific order thereon. It is further contended that the said fact has not been disputed byopposite party no.1-IBM in its counter affidavit. Interestingly, the decision to exclude ex-mine priceswas made on the very same day, when the show cause notice was issued by opposite party no.1-IBM,i.e., on 16.10.2021. On the date of issuance of show cause notice, the opposite party no.1-IBM wrotea letter to the Director (Statistics) and in-charge MMS Division of the IBM, recommending that ASPof the State of Odisha may be calculated excluding the ex-mine price of the mines, namely, JajangIron Ore and Nuagaon Iron Ore, which itself shows predetermined mindset of IBM and renders theentire exercise an empty formality.Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/5It is further contended that the petitioner- company's sales with related parties have been executedat prices discovered through transparent, fair and competitive e-auction and applied uniformly forboth related and unrelated parties and are therefore at arm's length. It is further contended that thepetitioner-// 17 // company conducted 11 auctions through MSTC between August, 2021 and December, 2021for carrying out price discovery, pursuant to which 50 players participated, of which only three arerelated parties, who were successful bidders also only on three occasions and three related partiesgot only a small quantity of 667550 MT, out of the total sold quantity of 2654400 MT, which isapproximately 25%. Traders were allowed to participate only in one auction and even in the same,they were permitted to participate for end-use (not for resale). Direct sales with traders who in turnhave sold to related parties are at comparable auction discovered price and therefore at arm'slength. Hence all sales of the petitioner-company in September, October and November, 2021 withboth related parties and traders were at prices equal to or more than the price determined ate-auction and applied for transactions with unrelated parties.It is further urged that Rule 45(8)(b)(III) of MCDR, 2017 permits sales to related parties, if done on// 18 // arm's length basis, and the said rule lays down a twin- test and prescribes that whilecomputing the ASP, the opposite party no.1-IBM should not recognize a transaction, where the salehas occurred between related parties and where the same is not on arm's length basis. It iscontended that Section 188(1) 4th proviso to the Companies Act, 2013 defines the expression "arm'slength transaction" as "a transaction between two related parties that is conducted as if they wereunrelated, so that there is no conflict of interest". If the petitioner-company's transactions are to betaken up, the sale-purchase transactions for iron ore between the petitioner-company and therelated party end users having steel manufacturing plant are transactions necessarily in the'ordinary course of business'. It is further contended that Rule 45(8) of the MCDR, 2017 framedlater in time i.e. notified on 27.01.2017 and thus necessarily and mandatorily informs the exercise ofcomputation of ASP under Rule 42 of MCR, 2016 notified on 04.03.2016. Thereby, rule ofconstruction is well settled that the later enactment prevails over an // 19 // earlier one. Therefore,Rule 42(2)(c) of MCR, 2016 includes the phrase "arm's length basis", the said words must be givenmeaning to, failing which they would be rendered otiose. Therefore, any possible ambiguity in thereading of the clause, gets resolved when read harmoniously with Rule 45(8)(b)(III) of the MCDR,2017 and a harmonious construction of the two provisions would indicate that related party salescannot per se or ipso facto be excluded by opposite party no.1-IBM in computation of ASP withoutexamining whether such related party sales satisfy the arm's length test or not.It is further contended that Rule 45(8)(b) of MCDR, 2017 replaced the earlier Rule 45(8)(b) ofMCDR, 1988 which provided that sales with related parties would not be recognized as a sale at all,whereas the present Rule 45(8)(b) of MCDR, 2017 introduces the nuance of arms length, therebynecessitating an application of mind as to whether these sales with related parties are at arm'slength or not. It is further contended that the impugned ASPs published by the // 20 // oppositeparty no.1-IBM do not reflect the true market price, particularly for low grade fines (below 60% FEgrade) where the international market slashing so far as iron ore is concerned. Thereby, the ASPfixed by the IBM is not sensitive to the drastic reduction in market price. As a consequence thereof,Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/6the volume of mineral intended to be sold affects the price of the mineral and higher volumecorresponds to low price and as such, does not correctly indicate the true market price and auctionfloor price has to correspond to the market price to get bidders/buyers.It is further contended that exclusion of petitioner's ex-mines prices would have a significant impacton the overall ASP, when the petitioner had dispatched 71% of the total low grade iron ore from themerchant mines in the entire State of Odisha during that period. It is further contended that theIBM has created an illusion of higher prices resulting in putting the petitioner-company to sustainloss and cause grater hardship for its survival.// 21 // To substantiate his contentions, he has relied upon Oryx Fisheries Private Limited v. Unionof India, (2010) 13 SCC 427; K.I. Shephard v. Union of India, (1987) 4 SCC 431; DIT (InternationalTaxation, Mumbai) v. Morgan Stanley & Co., (2007) 7 SSC 1; Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai v.Clariant (India) Ltd., Worli, (2007) 12 SCC 166; Solidaire India Ltd. V. Fairgrowth FinancialServices, (2001) 3 SCC 71; Union of India v. Popular Construction Co., (2001) 8 SCC 470 and Stateof Rajasthan v. Gopi Kishan Sen, 1993 Supp(I) SCC 522.4. Per contra, Mr. A.K. Parija, learned Advocate General of Odisha appearing along with Mr. P.P.Mohanty, learned Additional Government Advocate for opposite party no.2 vehemently refuted thecontentions raised by the learned Sr. Advocates appearing for the petitioner-company andcontended that the price slash given by the petitioner-company, with reference to the documentannexed as Annexure-A/2, the ex-mine price of iron ore reported by different bidders from July,2021 // 22 // to December, 2021 in monthly returns filed by opposite party no.1, is not a realisticprice slash in comparison to other similarly situated leaseholders, and further the document underAnnexure-A/1 filed by opposite party no.1-IBM i.e. mine-wise, grade-wise domestic sale reported inmonthly return for the month of September, 2021 clearly indicates that the sale had been made toself, though the initial sale, may be at some stages, indicates to be made to the traders, butultimately the dispatch was made to the traders "end users" and the "end users" are none else butthe petitioner-company. Though they are named as different companies, but said companies areacquired by the petitioner-company. As such, it is not applicable to the petitioner, rather it is acamouflaged manner of sale made by the petitioner- company to self by the traders and, as such, itshows trader transaction and effectively the purpose of the Act and Rules have not been adhered toin letter and spirit.It is further contended that the petitioner- company has tried to club two issues, namely, fixation of// 23 // price by opposite party no.1-IBM, and secondly with regard to non-compliance of theprinciple of natural justice, pursuant to show cause notice issued for non- compliance of thestatutory provisions contained in the Rules itself. It is also contended that the argument advancedby learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner-company, that there is non-compliance ofthe principle of natural justice, pursuant to show-cause notice dated 16.12.2021, to which thepetitioner- company replied on 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021, has nothing to do with the fixation ofprice and both run separately. As such, there is no provision under the Act and Rules to give anyhearing for fixation of price. It is emphatically argued before this Court that if the price, which hasbeen fixed, will be taken into consideration, then State will lose highest revenue which could haveAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/7been collected from the mining resources of the State. As a consequence thereof, it affects the Staterevenue and, more so, if the petitioner-company is aggrieved by the fixation of such price, analternative statutory remedy is available under Rule-161 of MCDR, 2017. Thereby, the // 24 // writpetition is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed at the threshold.It is also contended that the prayer, as made in the writ petition, on the face of it, is purelyconfusing. As such, the petitioner seeks to set aside and quash the impugned decision dated12.01.2022 issued by opposite party no.1 revising the ASP for the month of September and October,2021 for the State of Odisha, but no such document is available on record in any manner. Therefore,the claim made by the petitioner to quash the said decision cannot sustain. It is further contendedthat seeking direction not to take any decision to revise and determine the average different price,excluding ASP, is a domestic transaction of the lessee. As such, the petitioner-company cannot claimsuch relief before this Court. It is further contended that fixation of price is within complete domainof opposite party no.1-IBM, to which the petitioner, by way of filing writ petition, cannot regulate inany manner, as similarly situated many other leaseholders have not challenged such // 25 // actionknowing fully well the jurisdiction of this Court in such issues. It is also further contended that therelief sought before this Court, for direction to issue office memorandum on interpretation orimplementation of Rule 45 (8)(III) and Rule 45 (8)(IV) of the MCDR, 2017, cannot be granted, asthe Statute itself is very clear in that regard. So far as production of records is concerned, it is thepetitioner, who has to furnish all documents before the Court and, thereby, the production ofrecords pertaining to ASP for the State of Odisha is an absolutely misconceived relief sought beforethis Court. It is further contended that in one hand the argument has been advanced that pursuantto show-cause notice dated 16.12.2021 issued by opposite party no.1-IBM in respect of Jajang IronOre Mines and Nuagaon Iron Ore Mines in the State of Odisha, the petitioner-company has filedreplies on 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021 seeking compliance of the principle of natural justice, and onthe other hand, claims for quashing of such notice, which is an absolutely // 26 // misconceived one.Thereby, he seeks for dismissal of the writ petition.5. Mr. P.K. Parhi, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing along with Mr. J. Naik,learned Central Government Counsel for opposite parties no.1 & 3, referring to counter affidavit,contended that the replies dated 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021 submitted by the petitioner-company,pursuant to notice of show- cause issued on 16.12.2021, are under consideration and, as such,publication of ASP is all together a different process itself as per laid down procedure. It is alsocontended that the publication of final ASP is without consideration of reply to show-cause, is notcorrect, as the action of opposite party no.1-IBM is still under consideration. Thereby, the reliefsought by the petitioner cannot be granted. He has supported the argument advanced by learnedAdvocate General, Odisha appearing for opposite party no.2 and also laid emphasis on the fact thatthe claim of the petitioner- company for compliance of the principle of natural // 27 // justice is alltogether a different issue than that of fixation of ASP, and both are proceeded in different procedureof law. It is further contended that since there is alternative remedy available under the Statute,instead of availing the same, the petitioner could not have approached this Court by filing this writpetition. As a consequence thereof, the writ petition has to be dismissed at its threshold.Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/86. This Court heard Dr. A.M. Singhvi and Mr. G. Jain, learned Senior Advocates appearing alongwith Mr. S.S. Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioners; Mr. P.K. Parhi, learned AssistantSolicitor General of India appearing along with Mr. Jateswar Naik, learned Central GovernmentCounsel for opposite parties no.1 & 3- Indian Bureau of Mines; and Mr. A.K. Parija, learnedAdvocate General of Odisha along with Mr. P.P. Mohanty, learned Additional Government Advocatefor the opposite party-State, by hybrid mode. Pleadings have been exchanged between the partiesand with the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the writ // 28 // petition is being disposed offinally at the stage of admission.7. On the basis of the undisputed factual matrix, as delineated above, the following issues emerge forconsideration:-(i) Whether the reliefs sought as per the prayer made by the petitioners can begranted?(ii) Whether the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with or notfor alleged violation of Rule 45(7) and Rule 45(8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017?(iii) Whether the fixation of price and issuance of ASP is legally tenable or not?8. Issue no.(i) Whether the reliefs sought as per the prayer made by the petitioners can be granted?At the outset, Mr. A.K. Parija, learned Advocate General of Odisha raised preliminary objection withregard to the prayer made in the writ petition and contended that the relief sought cannot begranted to the petitioners and the writ petition should be dismissed in absence of any specific reliefsought. He lays emphasis on the prayer no.(a) of the writ petition wherein the petitioners haveprayed for direction to set // 29 // aside or quash the impugned decision dated 12.01.2022 issued byopposite party no.1 revising the ASP for the months of September and October, 2021 for the State ofOdisha. As such, on perusal of the records, no such document has been annexed to the writ petition,therefore, the prayer made for quashing of such document, is absolutely misconceived one. But factremains in paragraph-xxiii of the writ petition, the petitioners have pleaded as follows:"In Complete disregard of and without considering and /or disposing of the replyfurnished by the petitioner to the Notices and the letter dated letter dated 18.12.2021addressed by the petitioner to the CCOM (MDRD) OF THE Indian Bureau of Mines,Nagpur and with the sole purpose to circumvent the due to process of law, theOpposite party no. 1 proceed to declare and publish the ASP for the months ofSeptember, 2021and October,2021 excluding the ex-mine price of the Petitioner at9.00PM on 12.01.2022, i.e. after the filling and service of advance copy of the WritPetition (C) No.845 of 2022, solely with the intention to circumvent the due processof law."In view of such pleadings made available on record, the claim has been made, that as per thedecision taken on 12.01.2022, opposite party no.1-IBM proceeded to decide and publish the ASP forAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/9the month of September, 2021 and October, 2021, excluding ex-mine price of the petitioner, at 9 PMon 12.01.2022. Therefore, fixation of // 30 // such ASP has been made, pursuant to the decisiontaken on 12.01.2022, which is the subject matter of the dispute in the case itself. In prayer (b), it hasbeen sought to direct the opposite parties not to take any decision to revise or determine or publishthe ASP, excluding the ex-mine price, at domestic sale transactions of the lessee. It is contended thatsince such decision has not been placed on record, merely averring the same in paragraph-xxiii ofthe writ petition, the relief cannot be granted to the petitioners.9. In Charanjitlal v. Union of India, AIR 1951 SC 41 : 1950 SCR 869, the apex Court held that a wordabout prayer for a particular writ in the petition. Courts have very wide discretion in the matter offraming their writs to suit the exigencies of particular cases, and an application cannot be thrownout simply on the ground that the proper writ or direction has not been prayed for.10. In Satyanarain v. District Engineer, P.W.D., AIR 1962 SC 1161 : (1962) Supp.3 SCR 105, whereinthe apex Court held that appropriate relief may // 31 // be granted due to changed circumstancesand because of the prayer for grant of any other relief in the petition. But that has got restriction tothe extent that the same principle would not apply in case where the cause of action which hadbrought the petitioner to the court no longer subsisted.11. In Life Insurance Corporation v. Sunil Balo Kumar, AIR 1964 SC 847 : (1964) 5 SCR 528, theapex Court held that a party is not disentitled to claim the same relief on a basis alternative to onepleaded in his petition.12. In Chandigarh Admn. v. Laxman Roller Flour Mills (P) Ltd., (1988) 8 SCC 326, the apex Courtheld that unless the allegations are made in the writ petition and a relief to that effect is also prayedfor in the writ petition, the High Court is not justified in issuing any order in excess of the reliefprayed for in the writ petition. In the absence of pleading and prayer in the writ petition, the HighCourt fell in error in issuing directions to the appellant to issue completion certificate // 32 // to thewrit petitioner, when the challenge in the writ petition was for quashing cancellation of lease deedand dispossession from the plot by the Chandigarh administration.13. In the present case, even though the petitioners pleaded in paragraph-Xiii of the writ petitionand made prayer in Clause-(a) (b) with regard to quashing of the decision taken on 12.01.2022, butnothing has been placed on record about such decision. Therefore, even if prayer has not beenspecifically made, but in view of the pleadings available on record, the petitioners cannot bedisentitled to seek relief in the High Court in exercise of power under Article 226 of the Constitutionof India and, as such, the High Court can mould the relief sought by the petitioners.14. "Moulding of relief" principle was recognized by the Supreme Court in Pasupuleti Venkateswarluv. The Motor & General Traders, AIR 1975 SC 1709. It was observed therein that though the right torelief must be judged to exist as on the date a suitor institutes the // 33 // legal proceeding, theprinciple that procedure is the handmaid and not the mistress of the judicial process is also to benoted. Justice VR Krishna Iyer observed:Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/10"If a fact, arising after the lis has come to court and has a fundamental impact on theright to relief for the manner of moulding it, is brought diligently to the notice of thetribunal, it cannot blink at it or be blind to events which stultify or render inept thedecrotal remedy. Equity justifies bending the rules of procedure, where no specificprovision or fair play is violated, with a view to promote substantial justice-- subject,of course, to the absence of other disentitling (factors or just circumstances. Nor canwe contemplate any limitation on this power to take note of updated facts to confineit to the trial Court. If the litigation pends, the power exists, absent other specialcircumstances repelling resort to that course in law or justice. Rulings on this pointare legion, even as situations for applications of this equitable rule are myriad. Weaffirm the proposition that for making the right or remedy claimed by the party justand meaningful as also legally and factually in accord with the current realities, thecourt can, and in many cases must, take cautious cognizance of events anddevelopments subsequent to the institution of the proceeding provided the rules offairness to both sides are scrupulously obeyed.15. In Ramesh Kumar v. Kesho Ram, AIR 1992 SC 700, the Supreme Court again following thisprinciple, i.e. "moulding of relief", observed as follows:"6. The normal rule is that in any litigation the rights and obligations of the partiesare adjudicated upon as they obtain at the commencement of the lis. But this issubject to an exception. Wherever subsequent events of fact or law which have amaterial bearing on the entitlement of the parties to relief or on aspects which bearon the moulding of the relief occur, the court is not precluded from taking a 'cautiouscognizance' of the subsequent changes of fact and law to mould the relief."// 34 //16. In Sheshambal (dead) through LRs v.Chelur Corporation Chelur Building, (2010) 3 SCC 470, the apex Court laid down the conditions inwhich the relief can be moulded:"(i) that the relief, as claimed originally has, by reason of subsequent events, becomeinappropriate or cannot be granted;(ii) that taking note of such subsequent event or changed circumstances wouldshorten litigation and enable complete justice being done to the parties; and(iii) that such subsequent event is brought to the notice of the court promptly and inaccordance with the rules of procedural law so that the opposite party is not taken bysurprise."Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/1117. In Samir Narain Bhojwani v. Aurora Properties and Investments, (2018) 17 SCC 203 the apexCourt observed that principle of moulding of relief could at best be resorted to at the time ofconsideration of final relief in the main suit and not at an interlocutory stage.18. In Premalata Panda v. State of Odisha, 2015 (II) OLR 214, relying upon State of Rajasthan v.M/s. Hindustan Sugar Mills Ltd., AIR 1988 SC 1621 : (1988) 3 SCC 449 where the apex Court heldthat the High Court which was exercising high prerogative // 35 // jurisdiction under Article 226could have moulded the relief in a just and fair manner as required by the demands of the situation,this Court, in exercise of such power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India even though nospecific prayer was made in the writ petition, taking into consideration the facts and circumstancesof the case, was inclined to mould the relief and passed order/direction as deemed fit and proper asprayed for by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the writ petition.19. In view of the law laid down by the apex Court, so far as "moulding of relief" is concerned, thisCourt is of the considered view that even if there is no such specific prayer made in the writapplication, this Court can grant such relief, as has been advanced before this Court in course ofhearing of the matter, at the final stage by "moulding the relief".Accordingly, the preliminary objection raised by learned Advocate General, Odisha is answered infavour of the petitioners.// 36 //20.

In view of the provisions contained in Section 9 of the MMDR Act, 1957, the holder of a mininglease granted on or after the commencement of the Act shall pay royalty in respect of any mineralremoved or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub-lessee from theleased area at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral.22. To give effect to the Rules, the MCR, 2016 in Chapter XII deals with Mineral Valuation. Rule-38states about the sale value; Rule 39 deals with payment of royalty; Rule 40 deals with provisionalassessment and adjustment; Rule 42 deals with computation of average // 53 // sale price; Rule 43deals with publication of average sale price, whereas formula to that has been provided at Rule 45 asmentioned above. The MCR, 2016, which has been framed in exercise of the powers conferred underSection 13 of the MMDR Act, 1957, has come into force on its publication in the gazette of India on04.03.2016.23. Similarly, in exercise of power concerned under Section 18 of the MMDR Act, 1957 and insupersession of the Mineral Conservation & Development Rules 1988, except as respects thingsdone or omitted to be done before such supersession, the Central Government has framed MCDR,2017, which has come into force with effect from 27.02.2017 on its publication in the gazette ofIndia. Chapter-VI thereof deals with Notices and Returns. Rule 45 deals with monthly and annualreturns. As such, Form F1 has been provided for furnishing the monthly return, and Part-II thereofdeals with Production, Despatches and Stocks. Clause 4 of Part-II deals with details of deductionsmade from sale value for computation of Ex-Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/26// 54 // mine price. Therefore, the purpose of providing such Form F1 under Rule 45 (5) (b)(i) is tokeep track of the mineral used by the leaseholder for the purpose of determination of its royalty anddead rents and other statutory dues to be payable to the authority concerned.24. Explanation (b) to Section 188 (1) of Companies Act, 2013 provides the meaning of "arm's lengthtransaction" to the following effect:-"the expression arm's length transaction means a transaction between two relatedparties that is conducted as if they were unrelated, so that there is no conflict ofinterest."Fourth proviso to Section 188 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that "nothing in thissub-section shall apply to any transactions entered into by the company in its ordinary course ofbusiness other than transactions which are not on an arm's length basis".25. The transaction of the petitioner-company is in the ordinary course of business. In Black's LawDictionary, "ordinary course of business" means "normal routine in managing trade or business".Therefore, the sale purchase transactions of iron ore between the // 55 // petitioner-company andthe related party and users having steel manufacturing plants are transactions necessarily in theordinary course of business.26. The petitioner-company, as per the requirement of Rule 45 (7) of the MCDR, 2017, read withForm F1 has to submit the monthly returns to the opposite party no.1-IBM and providingrectification and explanation as required in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the IndianBureau of Mines and published by the opposite party no.3. Even though the petitioner-companycomplies such provisions scrupulously, on 16.12.2021, the opposite party no.1- IBM issued aviolation-cum- show cause notice to the petitioner-company in respect of Jajang Iron Ore Mines andNuagaon Iron Ore Mines in the State of Orissa, alleging violation of Rule 45 (7) and Rule 45 (8)(III)of the MCDR, 2017 and directed the petitioner-company to give reasons within 30 days from thedate of issue of the notice as to why not-"(a) All mining operations and dispatches of the mine should be stopped.(b) You should be prosecution under these rules.// 56 //(c) Recommended termination of the mining lease for suppression ormisrepresentation of information indicates abatment or connivance of illegalmining."27. In response to the said notice, the petitioner- company submitted its reply on 18.12.2021 to theCCOM (MDRD) of Indian Bureau of Mines, Nagpur, requesting that unless and until the abovestated reply is considered, no decision may be taken to revise the ASP already published excludingAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/27the domestic sale transactions of the lessee, the petitioner-company, herein, under the pretext thatthe same were not qualifying sale transactions under Rule 45 (7) and Rule 45 (8)(III) of the MCDR,2017. When such reply to show cause was pending for consideration, on 27.12.2021, thepetitioner-company furnished another reply stating that the notices do not fulfill the statutoryconditions for issuance thereof and ex-facie does not show any violation of other cause of action forwhich action is contemplated therein. But surprisingly, on the date of issuance of show cause notice,i.e. 16.12.2021, an internal correspondence was made by opposite party no.1-IBM to the Director,(Statistics) and In-Charge // 57 // MMS Division of the Indian Bureau of Mines, whereby, referringto the sale of various grades of iron ore by the petitioner-company from its iron ore mines in Jajangand Nuagaon, it was recommended that ASP of the State of Odisha may be calculated excluding theex-mine price of the above mines, as the same were allegedly not on arm's length basis.28. Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners emphatically submitted thatwhen such a letter has been addressed, may be an internal communication, and thepetitioner-company has filed its show cause replies on 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021, i.e. in relation toallegation of violation of certain conditions of the provisions of law, i.e. Rule 45 (7) and Rule 45(8)(III) of the MCDR 2017, the authorities have proceeded with determination of ASP, that itselfamounts to violation of principle of natural justice. It is further contended that the opposite partyno.1 has published ASP for September, 2021 and October, 2021 on 30.11.2021 and 29.12.2021respectively and marked // 58 // ASP for Iron Ore for the State of Orissa as "P" or "Provisional" forfew grades for which the published ASP was lower by more than 20% from published ASP of August,2021. Thereby, contended that till the grievances of the petitioner-company are meted out, pursuantto reply given by it to the notice of show cause dated 16.12.2021, the petitioner-company should bepermitted to sell on the provisional price fixed for month of September, 2021, instead of insistingupon to go for higher price, which would prejudice the interest of the petitioner-company.29. In Oryx Fisheries Private Limited (supra), the apex Court at paragraphs-31, 32 and 33 of thejudgment observed as follows:-"31. It is of course true that the show cause notice cannot be read hyper-technicallyand it is well settled that it is to be read reasonably. But one thing is clear that whilereading a show- cause notice the person who is subject to it must get an impressionthat he will get an effective opportunity to rebut the allegations contained in the showcause notice and prove his innocence. If on a reasonable reading of a show-causenotice a person of ordinary prudence gets the feeling that his reply to the show causenotice will be an empty ceremony and he will merely knock his head against theimpenetrable wall of prejudged opinion, such a show cause notice does notcommence a fair procedure especially when it is issued in a quasi- judicial proceedingunder a statutory regulation which // 59 // promises to give the person proceededagainst a reasonable opportunity of defence.32. Therefore, while issuing a show-cause notice, the authorities must take care tomanifestly keep an open mind as they are to act fairly in adjudging the guilt orotherwise of the person proceeded against and specially when he has the power toAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/28take a punitive step against the person after giving him a show cause notice.33. The principle that justice must not only be done but it must eminently appear tobe done as well is equally applicable to quasi judicial proceeding if such a proceedinghas to inspire confidence in the mind of those who are subject to it."30. Similarly, in K.I. Shephard (supra), the apex Court at paragraph-16 of the judgment observed asfollows:-"We may now point out that the learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court hadproposed a post-amalgamation hearing to meet the situation but that has beenvacated by the Division Bench. For the reasons we have indicated, there is nojustification to think of a post-decisional heading. On the other hand the normal ruleshould apply. It was also contended on behalf of the respondents that the excludedemployees could now represent and their cases could be examined. We do not thinkthat would meet the ends of justice. They have already been thrown out ofemployment and having been deprived of livelihood they must be facing seriousdifficulties. There is no justification to throw them out of employment and then giventhem an opportunity of representation when the requirement is that they should havethe opportunity referred to above as a condition precedent to action. It is commonexperience that once a decision has been taken, there is a tendency to uphold it and arepresentation may not really yield any fruitful purpose."31. In view of the law laid down by the apex Court, as discussed above, it is made clear that the // 60// show cause notice cannot be read hyper-technically and it should be read reasonably and, as such,it must give an effective opportunity to rebut such allegations contained in the show cause noticeand prove his innocence. Merely asking for show cause reply and the reply is submitted thereto andnon-consideration of the same amounts to empty formality, thereby such show cause notice doesnot commence as a fair procedure especially when it is issued in a quasi- judicial proceeding under astatutory regulation which promises to give the person proceeded against a reasonable opportunityof defence. As such, while issuing the show cause notice the authorities must take care to manifestlykeep an open mind as they are to act fairly in adjudging the guilt or otherwise of the personproceeded against and especially when he has the power to take a punitive step against the personafter giving him a show cause notice. The subsequent judgment of the apex Court, which has beenmentioned above, also reveals the same view where the apex Court held that there is no justificationto throw the employees out of employment // 61 // and then give them an opportunity ofrepresentation when the requirement is that they should have the opportunity as a conditionprecedent to action.32. Therefore, if the above principles are applied in letter and spirit to the present context, certainlyalleging violation of Rule 45 (7) and Rule 45 (8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017, a notice of show cause wasgiven on 16.12.2021, to which the petitioner-company submitted its reply on 18.12.2021 andsubsequently on 27.12.2021, and the same are pending before the authority for consideration.However, on the date of issuance of show cause notice, the internal commutation dated 16.12.2021Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/29was issued recommending that ASP of Odisha may be calculated excluding ex-mine price of Jajangand Nuagaon mines, as the same are allegedly not on "arm's length basis". Therefore, it can be safelyconstrued that opposite parties have not yet complied the principle of natural justice for having nottaken a decision on the show cause replies submitted by the petitioner-company. As a // 62 //matter of fact, the authorities should take a decision on the show cause replies submitted by thepetitioner- company, in response to the notice of show cause issued on 16.12.2021, in consonancewith the principle of natural justice. Thereby, Issue No.(ii) is answered in affirmative in favour of thepetitioner-company.33. Issue No. (iii).Whether the fixation of price and issuance of ASP is legally tenable or not? In view of the pleadingsavailable on record, the notice of show cause issued on 16.12.2021 for violation of certain proceduresenvisages under Rule 45 (7) read with Rule 45 (8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017, stands on a completelydifferent footing than that of fixation of price of royalty by the opposite parties.34. In view of the provisions of Section 9 of the MMDR Act, 1957, the holder of a mining leasegranted on or after the commencement of the Act shall pay royalty in respect of any mineralremoved or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub-lessee from theleased area at the rate for the // 63 // time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of thatmineral.35. To give effect to such provisions, MCR, 2016 came to effect. Chapter XII thereof deals withMineral Valuation. Rule-38 states that 'sale value' is the gross amount payable by the purchaser asindicated in the sale invoice where the sale transaction is on an "arms' length" basis and the price isthe sole consideration for the sale, excluding taxes, if any. Rule 39 deals with payment of royalty,meaning thereby the determination to pay the amount has to be made under sub-rule (3) of Rule 39,which specifies that wherever the Act specifies that the royalty in respect of any mineral is to be paidon an ad valorem basis, the royalty shall be calculated at the specified percentage of the average saleprice of such mineral grade/ concentrate, for the month of removal / consumption, as published bythe Indian Bureau of Mines. Sub-rule (5) of Rule 39 made it clear that wherever the Act specifiesthat the royalty of any mineral is to be paid on tonnage basis, the royalty shall be // 64 // calculatedas product of mineral removed or consumed from the lease area and the specified rate of royalty.Rule 40 deals with provisional assessment and adjustment; Rule 42 deals with computation ofaverage sale price. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 42 states, that the ex- mine price shall be used to computeaverage sale price of mineral grade/ concentrate. The ex-mine price of mineral grade or concentratehas been provided in Sub- rule (2) of Rule 42. Rule 43 deals with publication of average sale pricefixing 45 days limit from the due date for filing the monthly returns, as required under the MineralConcession Development Rules, 1988.36. The MCDR, 2017 has nothing to do with the MCR, 2016 and both the rules stand on separatefooting altogether, as per the nomenclature given to the Rules itself. Chapter VI of the MCDR, 2017deals with notices and returns, which compels the holder of a mining lease, or any person orcompany engaged in trading or storage or end-use or export of minerals mined in the country, shallAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/30cause himself to be registered online with the // 65 // Indian Bureau of Mines as per applicationspecified in Form-K of the Schedule and the registration number so allotted by the Indian Bureau ofMines shall be used for all purposes of online reporting and correspondence connected therewith.37. As per sub-rule (5)(b)(i) of Rule 45, a monthly return shall be submitted for all minerals exceptcopper, gold, lead, pyrite, tin, tungsten, zinc, precious and semi- precious stones, in Form F1 of theSchedule. Form F1, as mentioned above, requires a monthly return to be used for minerals otherthan the minerals specified therein. Thereby, it casts an obligation on the part of the holder of amining lease, or any person or company engaged in trading or storage or end-use or export ofminerals mined in the country to furnish such details, which provides elaborate utilization of theminerals unit of quantities in tones. The purpose of furnishing such returns is to indicate that theholder of mining lease cannot make any misutilization of minerals rather he // 66 // shall adhere tosuch monthly/annual returns scrupulously.38. Under sub-rule (7) of Rule 45, it has been indicated that, if it is found that the holder of a mininglease or the person or company engaged in trading or storage or end-use or export of minerals, asthe case may be, has submitted incomplete or wrong or false information in daily or monthly orannual returns or fails to submit a return within the date specified; then, he is liable for penal actionas specified therein under clauses-(a) to (c). Even the opportunity also been given to the parties, ifany violation is pointed out, to rectify the same within a period of 45 days, otherwise the actionshould be taken. Thereby, the rule is very sacrosanct for furnishing notice and returns.39. Rule 45(8)(III) of MCDR, 2017 also specifies that where sale has occurred, between relatedparties and is not on arm's length basis, then such sale shall not be recognized as a sale for thepurposes of this rule and in such case, sub-clause (IV) shall be applicable.// 67 // Thereby, for alleged violation of Rule 45 (7) read with Rule 45 (8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017,the show cause notice was issued on 16.12.2021, to which the petitioner-company had given replieson 18.12.2021 and 27.12.2021. That has got nothing to do with the fixation of payment of royalty interms of Rules 38, 39, 40 and 42 of MCR, 2016. Even though MCDR, 2017 has come into force on27.02.2017, it will apply in the context the Rule has been framed, which has no bearing with theMCR, 2016, which came into force with effect from 04.03.2016 and framed in a different contextaltogether. Thus, two separate rules have been framed for two separate purposes to achieve theultimate goal under the MMDR Act, 1957. Hence, the steps taken against the petitioner-company byissuing a notice of show cause on 16.12.2021 on the allegation of violation of Rule 45 (7) read withRule 45 (8)(III) of the MCDR, 2017 is totally different than that of the fixation of price to be madeunder MCR, 2016.// 68 //40. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the opposite parties no.1 and 3, in paragraphs-II andLL, it has been stated as follows:-Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/31II. Allegation of petitioner that the publication of Final ASP is without consideringreply of show cause notice is not correct, as action on the show cause notices on thepart of respondent no.1 is still under consideration and computation and publicationof ASP is altogether is different process and it is as per laid down procedure.xxx xxx xxx LL. Allegation of petitioner that the publication of Final ASP is withoutconsidering reply of show cause notice is not correct, as action on the part ofrespondent no.1 is still under consideration and computation and publication of ASPis altogether is different process and it is as per laid down procedure.Thereby, there is no dispute that pursuant to the show cause notice issued, the opposite party no.1has received the reply, which is still under consideration. Therefore, this Court already held that thesame should be considered in compliance to the principle of natural justice, while answering IssueNo.(ii). But, so far as the determination of ASP is concerned, that being dealt with under MCR, 2016,reliance has also been placed on the documents annexed to the counter affidavit filed on behalf ofopposite parties no.1 and 3 as Annexures-A/1 // 69 // and A/2. Annexure-A/1 prescribes Mine wise,grade wise domestic sale reported in monthly return for the month of September, 2021 so far as thepetitioner- company is concerned. From the entry available, it is found that quantity has beendispatched to a trader and trader to user which is none else but the company acquired by thepetitioner-company. For example, so far Sl. No.1 is concerned, the trader is M/s Seven HillsMinerals Private, to whom the quantity has been dispatched, who in turn sold it to the user, i.e., M/sBhushan Power & Steel Ltd (company acquired by M/s. JSW Steel Ltd, the petitioner-companyherein). As such, the sale price in which the lessee sold to the trader has been shown as 1336.70,whereas the sale price at which the trader sold to the user has been shown as 1354.18. As such, in theremark column, it has been clearly indicated that the JSW Steel Ltd. routed iron ore through M/s.Seven Hills Mineral Private Ltd. to M/s. Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd, which JSW Steel owns. It isfurther revealed that under the heading "Fe Grade 55 to below 58% Fine", the transaction has beenmade // 70 // between the petitioner-company and petitioner-company in the guise of the trader'sname M/s Seven Hills Minerals Private Ltd. Similarly, under the heading "Fe Grade 58 to below60% Fines", the Trader name is M/s. Brahmani River Pellets Limited and it has sold to JSW SteelLtd., but reported as domestic sale, which is a related party to JSW Steel Ltd., as confirmed by JSWSteel itself. Likewise, if each transaction contained in Annexure-A/1 is verified, it will be evident thatthe same is nothing but a transaction of the leaseholder with that of the very same person, but byintervening different traders' name in between, and the amount, as has been shown, is detrimentalto the interest of the State, who is the ultimate beneficiary of the revenue from the mining operation41. Similarly, if Annexure-A/2 will be taken into consideration, the ex-mine price of iron orereported by various non-captive leaseholders from July, 2021 to December, 2021 of monthly returnshas been indicated. The petitioner's name finds place at Sl. No. 8 and 9. So far as Nuagaon Iron OreMines is concerned, in August, // 71 // 2021, the ex-mine price has been shown at 4204, but for themonths of September, 2021 it has been shown as 1358.76, October, 2021- 575.3, November, 2021 -767.38 and December, 2021 - 1590. So far as Jajanga Iron Mines is concerned, which has beenplaced at Sl. No. 9, in August 2021, the ex-mine price has been shown at 4204, but for the months ofSeptember, 2021 it has been shown as 1485.01, October, 2021- 782.14, November, 2021 - 675 andAfr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/32December, 2021 - 641.87. If the same is compared with the other owners of the mines, the figureprovided by the petitioner-company, appears to be not a realistic price slash, as such the sale hasbeen made to the petitioner-company itself. As a consequence thereof, there is a gross loss to theState revenue. More so, under the Rules of MCR, 2016, no provision of hearing has been prescribedin compliance to principle of natural justice.42. By giving an unrealistic price slash, a huge loss has been caused to the revenue of theGovernment, which is against public interest. Needless to say, Rule 40 // 72 // of MCR, 2016 dealswith provisional assessment and adjustment, whereas computation of average sale price is to bemade pursuant to Rule 42 of the said Rules. If such computation is made by the authority in termsof the said rules, it cannot be said there is arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power by theauthority in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. As such, Rule 43 ofMCR, 2016 empowers the publication of average sale price by the Indian Bureau of Mines in respectof each mineral grade/concentrate removed from the mining leases in a month in a State within 45days from the due date for filing the monthly returns as required under the Mineral ConcessionDevelopment Rules, 1988. Adhering to Rule 43, if the computation has been made fixing ASP basingon the monthly returns, it cannot said that the authorities have acted arbitrarily, unreasonably andcontrary to the provisions of law so as to cause interference by this Court. Since MCR, 2016 andMCDR, 2017 operate separately and distinctly in separate areas, irrespective of their date ofcommencement, they have to govern in // 73 // their respective field. Therefore, the question ofconstruction of Rules that the later enactment prevails over the earlier one, cannot have anyjustification.43. Rule 42 (c) of MCR, 2016 prescribes the phrase "arm's length basis" and that would be takeninto consideration in common parlance vis-à-vis the provisions contained in Section 188 (1) of theCompanies Act, 2013, which also explains the expression "arms' length transaction" as a transactionbetween two related parties that is conducted as if they are unrelated, so that there is no conflict ofinterest. Therefore, the computation of ASP under Rule 42 of MCR, 2016 has been made taking intoconsideration the sale was occurred on "arm's length basis", as specified therein. Even though therewas price slash in international and domestic market of the different grades of the iron ore fines, thesame can only be considered and adjudicated in terms of MCR, 2016 on the basis of the monthlyreturns filed by the respective mines owners/lessees as per rule 42 of MCR 2016.// 74 //44. It is urged emphatically by the petitioner- company that the exclusion of petitioner-company'sex- mine price would have significant impact on the overall ASP and, as such, thepetitioner-company has dispatched 71% of total low grade ore from the merchant mines in the entireState of Orissa in that period. This Court is not competent to make an assessment on the dispatch orproduction, rather it is within the complete domain of the opposite party no.1-IBM, who used toreceive the monthly returns in terms of MCR, 2016 and fixes ASP for respective parties. Theallegations made that opposite party no.1-IBM has artificially created illusion of high price byreplacing the ex-mine price of several other lessees, apart from the petitioner-company, that cannotalso be taken into consideration, in view of the documents available on record under Annexures- A/1Afr vs Indian Bureau Of Mines on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127372652/33and A/2, which is apparently clear how the transaction has been taken place and how the price slashhas got an impact in respect of other similarly situated lessees and, as such, none of the lessees, saveand except the petitioner-company, has challenged the // 75 // same by filing writ petition.Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the fixation of ASP in terms of MCR, 2016 is tobe answered in affirmative in favour of the opposite parties and answered accordingly.45. In view of the facts and law, as discussed above, this Court is of the considered view that thefixation of ASP in terms of MCR, 2016 cannot be held to be illegal or arbitrary.46. In terms of the observations/directions give in the foregoing paragraphs, the writ petition standsdisposed.
