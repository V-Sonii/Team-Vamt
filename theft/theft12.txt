The brief facts of the case, as would emanate from the record of the learned trial Court, are asunder:-1. The complainant filed a complaint against the accused under Sections 452, 166,167, 427, 382, 388, 511, 411, 414, 201, 506, 148, 149 120-B IPC with the allegationsthat the complainant was a co-owner in possession to the extent of 2Â½ mls ofproperty bearing No.WM.243, Basti Guzan, Jalandhar. It has further been stated thatthe complainant 1 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -2-was running her business under the name and style of M/s Oriental ToolsCorporation for the last 50 years. The son of the complainant was also running hisbusiness from a portion of the demised property. It was further stated that accusedno.1-petitioner Kamaljit Singh Bhatia was an elected representative i.e. he was aMunicipal Councilor, Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar and also a Senior DeputyMayor of the Municipal Corporation, whereas the accused no.2 to 5 (sincedischarged) were government servants and also associates of the accused no.1. It wasfurther stated that complainant had instituted a Civil Suit for permanent InjunctionKamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/1against the Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar and details of the said civil proceedingswere enumerated in the complaint. It was further stated that the brother of thecomplainant, Shri Sharan Kumar. inducted one Ms. Pinky as a tenant in a portion ofhis share and she was not paying rent to the legal heirs of the said brother of thecomplainant. Accused no.1/petitioner was inimical towards the complainant asSharan Kumar was demanding rent from the said Ms. Pinky who was being favoredby the petitioner. On 22.9.2010 at about 4 PM. the accused no.1/petitioneraccompanied by his associate gunman etc. along with a Ditch Machine owned by theMunicipal Corporation, Jalandhar demolished a portion of the building premisesbearing no.WM 243, Basti Guzan, Jalandhar. The reason behind the high handednessof the accused was that the complainant had refused to please the petitioner byproviding water and electricity supply for the said Pinky. Again on 25.10.2010 atabout 12.30 PM the accused No.1/petitioner and accused 2 to 5 who weregovernment servants (since discharged) alongwith accused No.6 to 8 and a gang ofmuscle men descended on the demised property bearing No.WM- 243 Basti Guzan,Jalandhar alongwith a ditch machine and weapons and 2 of 16CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -3-started demolition of the property once again. The gates were cut using a gas cutter.After committing theft of different articles, the accused disposed off the stolen goodswith the assistance of accused No.6 to 8, who took the stolen goods to their shop andfrom there the stolen goods were disposed off. The act of the accused was without anyauthority of law or without having obtained any sanction from the Commissioner,Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar. The accused caused a loss of Rs.2 Lacsapproximately to the business establishment of the complainant. The complainantimmediately gave complaints to the police on 25.10.2010 but the police failed toinitiate any action against the accused. Hence the complaint came to be filed.3. Pursuant to the recording of preliminary evidence, all the accused persons came tobe summoned under Sections 452, 166, 167, 427, 382, 388, 511, 411, 414, 201, 506,148, 149 and 120-B IPC vide order dated 09.09.2013.Three summoned accused namely, Rahul Gupta, the then Joint Commissioner, MunicipalCorporation, Jalandhar, Hemant Batra, the then M.T.P., Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar andRajiv Rishi, the then Inspector, Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar filed their revision petitionsagainst the summoning order dated 09.09.2013. The Court of learned Additional District Judge,Jalandhar came to the categoric conclusion that the petitioners therein (accused No.2, 3 and 5 in thecomplaint) had acted in the discharge of their official duty. Since they had acted in their discharge ofofficial duty, the Court could not have taken cognizance of the complaint in the absence of sanctionunder Section 197 Cr.P.C. Therefore, the summoning order qua the said three accused was set asideand they were discharged vide order dated 06.10.2014 (P-10). Para Nos.6 and 7 of the order dated06.10.2014 are reproduced herein below:-3 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -4-Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/2"6. I found force in the contentions of learned counsel for the revisionists because ithas come on the record that the area in which the property in dispute falls wasacquired through award No.1 of 15.09.1986 for public purpose i.e. providing sewer,streets etc. for easing out the traffic congestion and possession was also handed overto Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar. Subsequently some area was exempted and theremaining was used for providing sewer and street etc. Thereafter on 07.02.1992 itwas reported by the building inspector of the area that Jyoti Saroopcomplainant/respondent is raising unauthorised construction and on the report anotice under section 269 of the Act was served. On further verification it was foundthat the unauthorised construction raised by the complainant was encroachmentupon the street area by 10 feet X 21 feet and said street vests in the municipalcorporation, Jalandhar and a notice under section 246(1) of the Act was served on12.02.1992 and complainant filed a suit for permanent injunction regarding theproperty in dispute. The said suit was decreed vide judgment and decree dated04.06.1998 by the court of Sh. Naginderjit Singh Additional Civil Judge (SeniorDivision), Jalandhar and then Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar filed a regular civilappeal against the said judgment and decree. The appeal was accepted and suit wasdismissed vide order dated 09.04.2002 passed by Sh. Surinder Gupta the thenAdditional District Judge, Jalandhar. Thereafter the notice was issued by thenAssistant Town Planner Dharam Pal exercising the delegated powers ofCommissioner Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar for removal of encroachment andon non-compliance thereof the demolition was carried out by the officials ofMunicipal Corporation, Jalandhar in discharge of their official duties as per theorders of then Municipal Town Planner Hemant 4 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M)-5-Batra revisionist No.2. The revisionists have done all these acts in the discharge oftheir official duty. I am of the view that when the acts have been done by any publicofficial in the discharge of his official duty, then the jurisdiction of the court isexpressly barred under the provisions of section 197 of Cr.P.C. and it beingmandatory to obtain sanction from the government before proceeding against theaccused. In this connection I am fortified with the case law 2004(2)RCR(Criminal)titled State of Orissa through Kumar Raghvendra Singh Vs Ganesh Chandra Jewwherein it has been observed as under:-Criminal Procedure Code, Section 197- Complaint against Public Servant Cognizanceof any offence, by any court, is barred by section 197 of the Code unless sanction isobtained from the appropriate authority, if the offence, alleged to have beencommitted, was in discharge of the official duty-Bar on the exercise of power by thecourt to take cognizance of any offence is absolute and complete- Very cognizance isbarred-That is the complaint, cannot be taken notice of.In the case law titled Vinod Krishna Kaul Vs S.A.Khan 2006(1) JudicialReports(Criminal) page 14, it has been observed as under:-Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/3Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, Section 197- Penal Code, 1860, Section 500-Sanction for prosecution-Offence committed during by official during the course ofhis official duties-Prior sanction from the Govt. u/s 197 Cr.P.C. required Courtdebarred from taking cognizance of the alleged offence for want of sanction.The above said case law is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. I am of theview that without sanction under section 197 Cr.P.C.the case cannot be continue.                             5 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M)                                                     -6-7.In view of my above discussion, relying upon the case law referred above thepresent revision petition is accepted. The order dated 09.09.2013 whereby thelearned trial court has summoned the revisionists No.1 to 3 to face trial under section452/ 166/ 167/ 427/ 382/ 511/ 411/ 414/ 201/ 506/ 148/149/ 120-B IPC is set asideand the accused/ revisionists No.1 to 3 namely Rahul Gupta, Hemant Batra and RajivRishi are ordered to be discharged. Lower Court record be sent back and revision filesbe consigned to the record room."4. The petitioner herein, who was the then Senior Deputy Mayor, also preferred arevision petition against the order of summoning. However, the said revision petitionwas dismissed on 06.10.2014 (Annexure P-1) itself, on the ground that the petitionerbeing a Municipal Councilor and at that time being a Senior Deputy Mayor in theMunicipal Corporation, Jalandhar, was not a public servant. Paras 6 to 8 of the orderdated 06.10.2014 is as under:-"6. The revisionist is a Municipal Commissioner and is at present Senior DeputyMayor in Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar. I am of the view that he is not a publicservant as per Section 21 of IPC. It has been held in Ramesh Balkrishna Kulkarni vs.State of Maharashtta, AIR 1985 SC 1655 that "Municipal Commissioner Whetherpublic servant?- A "public servant" is an authority who must be appointed byGovernment or a semi-governmental body and should be in the pay or salary of thesame and must discharge his duties in accordance with the rules and regulationsmade by the Government. A Municipal Councilor does not owe his appointment toany governmental authority. He does not answer the test of a public servant."Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/4                                6 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M)                                                     -7-7. So far as case law referred by the counsel for the revisionist is concerned, the sameis not applicable to the facts of the present case because in the present case therevisionist is not a public servant.8. I am of the view that since revisionist is not a public servant, sanction underSection 197 Cr.P.C is not required before summoning the accused. As such, I do notfind any merit in this revision and the same is dismissed. The Lower Court file bereturned with copy of this judgment. The parties directed to appear before thelearned lower Court on 10.11.2014. Ahlmad is directed to send the file immediatelyand criminal revision file be consigned to the record room."5. The present petition has been filed challenging the impugned order dated06.10.2014 (Annexure P-1) passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,Jalandhar as also the order of summoning (Annexure P-2) dated 09.09.2013.6. The learned counsel for the petitioner firstly contends that all the accused persons acted in thedischarge of their official duties and this finding recorded by the Revisional Court in the order ofdischarge of some of the accused (Annexure P-10), remains unchallenged. He, thus, prays that theprotection under Section 197 Cr.P.C. be accorded to him as well and that as per Section 417 of thePunjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, every Councilor, Commissioner and Corporation officerand employee of every Councilor, Commissioner and other employee is deemed to be a publicservant under Section 21 IPC. He thus, submits that by virtue of Section 417 Cr.P.C., the petitioner,who was the then Senior Deputy Mayor of the Municipal Corporation, Jalandhar, was a publicservant as defined under Section 417 read with Section 21 IPC.                                 7 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M)                                                      -8-7. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the complainant contends that the petitioner being aSenior Deputy Mayor could not be a public servant, who was to get the protection under Section 197Cr.P.C. He relies upon Ramesh Balkrishna Kulkarni Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1985 SC 1655.8. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/59. Before proceeding further in the matter, it would be useful to refer to the relevant provisions oflaw, for the proper adjudication of the present case.Section 21 IPC reads as under:-"Public servant".--The words "public servant" denote a person falling under any ofthe descriptions hereinafter following; namely:-(Second)--Every Commissioned Officer in the Military, [Naval or Air] Forces [***] ofIndia];(Third)--Every Judge including any person empowered by law to discharge, whetherby himself or as a member of any body of persons, any adjudicatory functions;](Fourth)-- Every officer of a Court of Justice [(including a liquidator, receiver orcommissioner)] whose duty it is, as such officer, to investigate or report on anymatter of law or fact, or to make, authenticate, or keep any document, or to takecharge or dispose of any property, or to execute any judicial process, or to administerany oath, or to interpret, or to preserve order in the Court, and every person speciallyauthorized by a Court of Justice to perform any of such duties;(Fifth)-- Every juryman, assessor, or member of a panchayat assisting a Court ofJustice or public servant;(Sixth)-- Every arbitrator or other person to whom any cause or matter has been referred fordecision or report by 8 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -9-any Court of Justice, or by any other competent public authority;(Seventh)--Every person who holds any office by virtue of which he is empowered toplace or keep any person in confinement;(Eighth)-- Every officer of the Government whose duty it is, as such officer, toprevent offences, to give information of offences, to bring offenders to justice, or toprotect the public health, safety or convenience;(Ninth)-- Every officer whose duty it is, as such officer, to take, receive, keep orexpend any property on behalf of or to make any survey, assessment or contract onbehalf of or to execute any revenue process, or to investigate, or to report, on anymatter affecting the pecuniary interests of, or to make, authenticate or keep anydocument relating to the pecuniary interests of, or to prevent the infraction of anylaw for the protection of the pecuniary interests of the Government;(Tenth)-- Every officer whose duty it is, as such officer, to take, receive, keep orexpend any property, to make any survey or assessment or to levy any rate or tax forKamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon -

So far as, the law relating to sanction for prosecution is concerned, the variousjudgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court as also this Court are categoric to the effect thatcognizance of an offence cannot be taken without their being prior prosecutionsanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C., where the officer concerned has acted in thedischarge of his official duties.Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/8The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'State of Orissa Through Kumar Raghvendra Singh &others Vs. Ganesh Chandra Jew, 2004(2) RCR (Criminal) 663 in Para Nos.9, 11 and12, held as under:-"9. So far public servants are concerned the cognizance of any offence, by any court,is barred by Section 197 of the Code unless sanction is obtained from the appropriateauthority, if the offence, alleged to have been committed, was in discharge of theofficial duty. The section not only specifies the persons to whom the protection isafforded but it also specifies the conditions and circumstances in which it shall beavailable and the effect in law if the conditions are satisfied. The mandatory characterof the protection afforded to a public servant is brought out by a the expression, 'nocourt shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction'. Use ofthe words, 'no' and 'shall' make it abundantly clear that the bar on the exercise ofpower by the court to take cognizance of any offence is absolute and complete. Verycognizance is barred.That is the complaint, cannot be taken notice of. According to Black's Law Dictionarythe word 'cognizance' means 'jurisdiction' or 'the exercise of jurisdiction' or 'power totry and determine causes'. In common parlance it means taking notice of. A court,therefore, is precluded from entertaining a complaint or taking notice of it orexercising jurisdiction if it is in respect of a public servant who is accused of anoffence 12 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -13-alleged to have committed during discharge of his official duty.11. It has been widened further by extending protection to even those acts oromissions which are done in purported exercise of official duty. That is under thecolour of office. Official duty therefore implies that the act or omission must havebeen done by the public servant in course of his service and such act or omissionmust have been performed as part of duty which further must have been official innature. The Section has, thus, to be construed strictly, while determining itsapplicability to any act or omission in course of service.Its operation has to be limited to those duties which are discharged in course of duty.But once any act or omission has been found to have been committed by a publicservant in discharge of his duty then it must be given liberal and wide construction sofar its official nature is concerned. For instance a public servant is not entitled toindulge in criminal activities. To that extent the Section has to be construed narrowlyand in a restricted manner. But once it is established that act or omission was doneby the public servant while discharging his duty then the scope of its being officialshould be construed so as to advance the objective of the Section in favour of thepublic servant. Otherwise the entire purpose of affording protection to a publicservant without sanction shall stand frustrated. For instance a police officer indischarge of duty may have to use force which may be an offence for the prosecutionKamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/9of which the sanction may be necessary. But if the same officer commits an act incourse of service but not in discharge of his duty and without any justificationtherefor then the bar under Section 197 of the Code is not attracted. To what extentan act or omission performed by a public servant in discharge of his duty can bedeemed to be official was explained by 13 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -14-this Court in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari (AIR 1956 Supreme Court 44) thus :"The offence alleged to have been committed (by the accused) must have somethingto do, or must be related in some manner with the discharge of official duty .. theremust be a reasonable connection between the act and the discharge of official duty;the act must bear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a reasonable(claim) but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did it in the course of theperformance of his duty.".12. If on facts, therefore, it is prima facie found that the act or omission for which theaccused was charged had reasonable connection with discharge of his duty then itmust be held to official to which applicability of Section 197 of the Code cannot bedisputed."This Court in Vinod Krishna Kaul Vs. S.A. Khan, 2005(4) RCR (Criminal) 490 in paraNos. 10 and 11 of the judgment, held as under:-"10. The aforesaid facts have not been disputed by the respondent as no reply hasbeen filed. In view of the aforesaid undisputed facts, it appears that whatsoeverprima-facie the petitioner had done, that was done in discharge of his official duties.In these facts, if the respondent alleges that some offence was committed by theofficial during the course of his official duties, then prior sanction from theGovernment under Section 197 Criminal Procedure Code was required and the Courtwas debarred from taking cognizance of the alleged offence for want of sanction.11. In the above facts and circumstances, prima facie, it appears to this Court that thealleged acts on the part of the petitioner were purported to have been done inexercise of 14 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M) -15-his official duties. Therefore, taking cognizance of the alleged offence without priorsanction and continuation of such proceedings is without jurisdiction and abuse ofthe process of the law.Similarly, in 'Lakshmi Narain Vs. Mohan Lal, RCR (Criminal) 607', the prosecution ofthe President of the Municipal Committee was quashed on account of the fact thatunder Section 21 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1976 the President of the MunicipalCommittee was deemed to be a public servant.Kamaljit Singh Bhatia vs Jyoti Sarup And Ors on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132755420/1011. A perusal of the relevant provisions of law as also the aforementioned judgments would showthat once the accused had acted in the discharge of their official duties, then they were liable for theprotection accorded under Section 197 Cr.P.C. In the present case, admittedly, some of the accusedhave also been discharged from prosecution. So far as the present petitioner is concerned, thefinding against him was that he could not be accorded the protection under Section 197 Cr.P..C. ashe was not a public servant. That finding is contrary to law as a combined reading of Section 417 ofthe Punjab Municipal Corporation Act. along with Section 21 IPC and Section 197 Cr.P..C., wouldclearly show that the petitioner was a public servant, who allegedly committed the offence in thedischarge of his official duties (a finding of fact which has remained unchallenged) and wasprosecuted without sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C..12. The judgment in 'Ramesh Balkrishna Kulkarni's case (supra) would not come to the aid of thecomplainant because the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act makes every officer a public servantunder Section 21 IPC, something which was not the case in 'Ramesh Balkrishna Kulkarni's case(supra).                              15 of 16 CRM-M-11791-2015(O&M)                                              -16-13.
