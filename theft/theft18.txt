Further, DW-1 Nahar Singh, Head Constable, C.B.C.I.D. Dog Squad, Lucknow has statedbefore the trial Court that on 11.11.1994, at about 11:00 p.m., a demand was made from Faizabad forDog Squad and he reached Faizabad at 3:00 p.m. and after that, he reached the place of occurrencewith sniffer dog Neera at about 04:00 p.m. He, thereafter, gave the sniffer dog the smell from thespot but the dog went upto the tube-well, took a round there and returned without success. D.W.1had further stated that in cases where the accused are named in the FIR, there is no necessity tobring the dog to trace the culprits and dog squad is requisitioned only when the culprits have to betraced. In these backgrounds, his submission is that the FIR of the incident was not in existencefrom the time of inquest report till the returning of sniffer dog from the place of occurrence asP.W.2-Uma Kant Verma, in his cross-examination, had categorically stated before the trial Courtthat after the incident, all the family members had gathered and talked to each other in respect ofthe incident and conversation took place with his brother to the family members in respect oflodging of report against whom person(s) and further P.W.2 has stated that a conversation wasgoing on in respect of lodging report against Krishna Murari, Kashi Ram, Ram Milan and Raghavand not against other persons. In support of his submission, he has placed reliance upon thejudgment of the Madras High Court in the case of Micheal alias Nai Micheal Vs. State passed in Crl.A. (MD) No. 178 of 2010 on 03.09.2010.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/20(II) P.W.10-Sudhakar Pandey has deposed before the trial Court that he recorded the statements ofwitnesses Daljeet Singh and Hari Om Singh at the time of panchayatnama when they reached theplace of occurrence and, whatever he found the evidence in the statements of Daljeet Singh and HariOm Singh, on that basis he arrested Ram Tilak. In addition to that, there was no other evidenceagainst Ram Tilak for arresting him, whereas as per the F.I.R., Ram Tilak was named accused,which establishes that the FIR is ante-timed.(III) The entire case rests on the ocular testimony of P.W.1 and P.W.2, who are said to havewitnessed the incident. Both of them are interested witnesses. The presence of P.W.1-Rama KantVerma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma is highly doubtful. P.W.1, in his cross-examination, haddeposed before the trial court that during the incident, no injury on his body of any types hadoccurred; his brother Uma Kant Verma did not sustain any type of injury during the incident by theaccused persons; during incident, witnesses of the case Manik Ram, Munna Lal, Babu Lal Harijanand his father Ramtej were also not sustained any type of injury from the side of accused persons.According to him, P.W.2-Uma Kant, in his examination-in-chief, at one place, had stated thatthereafter, the accused ran for assaulting his brother Rama Kant and his cousin Girish and assaultedthem. Later on, P.W.2, in cross-examination, had stated that his brother Rama Kant was notassaulted. P.W.2, in cross-examination, has also stated before the trial Court that some persons werestayed whole night at the tubewell and some persons had gone from there; they did not try to go tothe police station in the night with their assistance; Chaukidar neither came there nor he was called.He also stated that P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma had stated that though Ram Dev stood, he did not run,whereas P.W.1 had stated that Ram Dev also stood from cot. P.W.2 had further stated that when hisgrand-father and his uncle were beaten, at that time, he and Girish (deceased) were coming outfrom tubewell and his uncle and grand-father was beaten at a distance of 5-7 steps from tubewelland after coming out from tubewell, they, while raising the alarm, ran towards the field of sugarcaneand not standing there. P.W.1 has stated that accused persons while leaving Ram Naresh and Sukai,ran towards him and he, thereafter, ran towards the northern side. P.W.1 had later on stated that theaccused ran towards Ram Dev and Girish. In these backgrounds, his submission is that the presenceof P.W.1 and P.W.2 during the incident are doubtful and their statements are contradictory.IV The medical evidence does not support the prosecution story. As per the statement of P.W.1,P.W.2 and the F.I.R., the incident was in the night of about 02:30 p.m. P.W.1 and P.W.2 have statedthat deceased Girish after taking dinner at about 09:15 p.m. and other deceased at 10:15 p.m., cameat the tubewell. P.W.9-Dr. O.P. Khatri has stated that half digested food was found in the stomach ofthe four deceased, which could be of three to four hours. His submission is that from the statementsof P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.9, it transpires that all the deceased had eaten before 10:00 O'clock in thenight and the maximum time of three hours of the above meal is added to it, then, the incident willbe around 01:00 a.m. in the night and if one hour survival time is excluded as stated by P.W.9, then,the incident took place at 12:00 O'clock in the night, which creates reasonable doubt the presence ofP.W.1 and P.W.2 at the place of occurrence during the incident. In this regard, he has placedreliance upon the judgments of this Court passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in CriminalAppeal No. 431 of 1990 : Jaikaran and another Vs. State of U.P., decided on 15.05.2018.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/21V. While passing the impugned judgment, the learned trial Court has committed an error inadopting two separate parameters, by one way acquitted two accused persons, namely, Ram TilakVerma and Ram Kripal Verma and by the other way, convicted and awarded the appellants capitalsentence on the same set of facts and evidences. In this regard he has invited our attention towardsthe judgment of the Apex Court in Criminal Appeal No. 434-436 of 2020 : Jaikam Khan vs. TheState of Uttar Pradesh, decided on 15.12.2021 and has stated that the Apex Court in the aforesaidjudgment held in para-81 about choosing between two or more possibilities, and preponderates ofone over the other etc. He has also placed reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in AmarSingh Vs. The State (NCT of Delhi) : Criminal Appeal No. 335 of 2015, decided on 12.10.2020.VI The prosecution has failed to prove the motive of the appellants to commit the murders of thedeceased but from the evidence of the prosecution, it is established that the informant P.W.1 RamaKant Verma had falsely implicated the appellants in the instant case. The evidences of theprosecution show that a litigation was pending between the victims and one of the appellant,namely, Krishna Murari and there was no enmity with the other appellants and two acquittedpersons, however, P.W.1 and P.W.2, in their cross-examination, has admitted the facts that thereoccurred some quarrel in between Ram Milan, appellants and prosecution witnesses with respect tothe taking of water of the fields. It has also been admitted that motor of Raghav Ram had beenstolen and in that theft case, Raghav Ram and Kashi Ram had made complained against Uma KantVerma P.W.2 and in that case, police made inquiry and came to the residence of Uma Kant Vermaand had left after inquiry without doing anything against Uma Kant Verma . According to him, thesefour appellants are not related closely or distantly to each other and there was no reason for thesepersons to have united to commit the murder of four persons in a pre-planned manner.VII The beneficiary of the incident appears to be the prosecution side and not the appellants and twoacquitted persons. He argued that Sukai had three sons, namely, Ram Naresh (deceased), Ram Dev(deceased), Ram Tej (father of P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma ) and Girish(deceased) is the son of Ram Naresh (deceased) Ram Dev (deceased) had three married daughters.Therefore, the property left by Sukai and his two deceased sons came to be vested in Ram Tej, fatherof P.W.1 and P.W.2.VIII The statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. has not been considered by the trial Court.The investigation of the case is also tainted as weapon of assault has not been recovered by theInvestigating Officer; statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. of P.W.10 Sri Sudhakar Pandey andConstable Ram Harsh Yadav, who had scribed the chik F.I.R., has not been found in the case diary;father of P.W.1 has not been examined as prosecution witness while as per FIR he was eye-witness;no injury has been found on the person of P.W.1 and P.W.2; the prosecution has not explained thedelay for sending G.D. before Circle Officer after three days; darkness found in the fields; no nearestvillagers were examined by the Investigating Officer nor produced before the trial Court for his/herexamination; recovery memo of bed sheets of the cots of the deceased have not been examined bythe Investigating Officer during trial proceedings nor produced.IX     Lastly, it has been argued that the appellants are more than 70 years old and are languishing in jail for more than 17 years without committing any offence, hence the impugned judgment is liable to be quashed.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/22(D)     RESPONDENT/STATE ARGUMENTS    (32) On behalf of the State, Shri Vimal Kumar Srivastava, learned Government Advocate assisted by Shri Chandra Shekhar Pandey, learned Additional Government Advocate has argued that I. Though the deceased are the family members of P.W.1 and P.W.2 and are related to each other,their testimony cannot be discarded merely because the relationship can never be a factor to affectthe credibility of witnesses. His submission is that P.W.1 and P.W.2 have established their presenceat the place and time of occurrence and their statements are trustworthy. In support of thiscontention, he has placed reliance upon Yogesh Singh Vs. Mahabeer Singh : (2017) 11 SCC 195, ShioShanekar Dubey Vs. State of Bihar : (2019) 6 SCC 501, Sudhakar alias Sudharshan Vs. Staterepresented by the Inspector of Police, Sri Rangam Police Station Trichy, Tamil Nadu : (2018) 5 SCC435.II. The failure of the prosecution to recover the weapon from the accused persons/appellants is notfatal to the prosecution case as the statements of eye-witnesses P.W.1 and P.W.2 have been clear andconsistent while describing the sequence of events that had taken place on the day of the occurrence.There is no material discrepancy or contradiction in the statements of P.W.1 and P.W.2 as they hadidentified the appellants, who committed the murders of the deceased with Gandasa and Banka,which also corroborates with the medical evidence. In support of this assertion, he has placedreliance upon Ram Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan : (2012) 12 SCC 339.III. The statements of P.W.1 and P.W.2 show that appellants committed the murder of the fourdeceased persons in the night of 10.11.1994 at about 02:30 a.m. with Gandasa and Banka and themedical evidences have also supported the prosecution case. There is direct evidence against theappellants for murdering of the deceased. The trial Court has rightly discarded the plea of theappellants. His submission is that as the ocular testimony of P.W.1 and P.W.2 are reliable andtrustworthy, it cannot be discarded only because of absence of motive. In this regard, he has placedreliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in Bipin Kumar Mondal Vs. State of West Bengal :(2010) 12 SCC 91.IV. So far as the sentence is concerned, while placing reliance upon Machhi Singh and others Vs.State of Punjab : (1983) SCC 470, he argued that the trial Court has rightly sentenced the appellantsfor capital punishment as the prosecution has fully established that this case falls under the categoryof ''rarest of rare cases'.(E) REVISIONIST/INFORMANT (33) None responds on behalf of the revisionist/informant norlearned Counsel for the respondents no. 1 and 2/acquitted persons in Criminal Revision No. 14 of2000.However, learned Government Advocate appearing on behalf of the State has stated that no appealagainst the acquittal of Ram Kripal and Ram Tilak have been filed on behalf of the State. Hissubmission is that the trial Court, after appreciating the evidence on record, has rightly acquittedRam Kripal and Ram Tilak as the charge against them is only of conspiracy for committing murders,State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/23which the prosecution has not proved.(F) DISCUSSION/ANALYSIS (34) We have heard Sri Umesh Pratap Singh and Sri Shitla PrasadTiwari, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the convicts/appellants, Sri Vimal Kumar Srivastava,learned Government Advocate assisted by Sri Chandra Shekhar Pandey, learned AdditionalGovernment Advocate for the State/ respondent at length and have carefully gone through theimpugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned trial Court. Wehave also re-appreciated the entire evidence on record, particularly the depositions of PW1 RamaKant Verma and PW2 Uma Kant Verma. We have also considered the ante-mortem injuries foundon four deceased persons.(35) It would become manifest from the aforesaid that the learned trial Court has based theconviction of appellants and acquittal of Ram Tilak Verma and Ram Kripal Verma on the oculartestimony of the informant Rama Kant Verma PW-1 and Uma Kant Verma PW-2, who are the familymembers of the deceased. Submission of learned Counsel for the convicts/appellants that thetestimonies of P.W.1 and P.W.2 cannot be relied upon as they are interested and family members ofthe deceased and further their presence at the place of occurrence is doubtful.(36) Undisputedly, both P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma, who areeye-witnesses, are family members of the deceased. It is settled law that merely because thewitnesses are interested and related witnesses, it cannot be a ground to disbelieve their testimony.However, the testimony of such witnesses has to be scrutinized with due care and caution and uponscrutiny of the evidence of such witnesses, if the Court is satisfied that the evidence is creditworthy,then, there is no bar on the Court in relying on such witness. (See Dalbir Kaur Vs. State of Punjab :(1976) 4 SCC 158, Piara Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab : (1977) 4 SCC 452, Anil Phukan Vs.State of Assam : (1993) 3 SCC 282, Sudhkar alias Sudharshan Vs. State Represented by theInspector of Police, Sri Rangam Police Station Trichy, Tamil Nadu : (2018) 5 SCC 435, Sheo ShankarDubey Vs. State of Bihar : (2019) 6 SCC 501.(37) In Kartik Malhar Vs. State of Bihar : (1996) 1 SCC 614, the Apex Court has held that a closerelative who is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness. Paras-15 and 16of the report are reproduced as under :-"15. As to the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the witness was the widow of thedeceased and was, therefore, highly interested and her statement be discarded, we may observe thata close relative who is a natural witness regarded as an interested witness. The term "interested"postulates that the witness must have some direct interest in having the accused somehow or theother convicted for some animus or for some other reason. In Dalbir Kaur and Others v. State ofPunjab, (1976) 4 SCC 158, it has been observed as under :"Moreover a clause relative who is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested,witness. The term 'interested postulates that the person concerned must have some direct interest inseeing that the accused person is somehow or the other convicted either because he had someanimus with the accused or for some other reason. Such is not the case here,"State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/24In Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR (1953) SC 364, it has laid down as under :"A witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources whichare likely lo be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause such as enmity againstthe accused, to wish to implicate him falsely. Ordinarily, a close relative would be the last to screenthe real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and thereis personal cause for enmity, that there is tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom awitness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and themere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth. However, weare not any sweeping generalisation. Each case must be judged on its own facts. Our observationsare only made to combat what is so often but forward in cases before us as a general rule ofprudence. There is no such general rule. Each case must be limited to and be governed by its ownfacts."(38) Thus, it will be necessary to scrutinize the evidence of P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma andP.W.2-Uma Kant Verma with more care, caution and circumspection.(39) It transpires from the depositions of P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma that all four convicts/appellantsand 2-3 unknown persons who covered their faces came to the tubewell of the informant's family inthe intervention night of 10/11.11.1994 at 02:30 p.m. According to him, at that time, he was sleepingalong with his cousin brother Girish Chandra Verma inside the tube-well room by shutting its door;his uncle Ram Naresh (father of Girish Chandra Verma) and his grand-father Sukai were sleepingon separate cots under the Chhappar situated in the direction of west of tube-well; another uncleRam Dev was sleeping under the Chhappar situated on South side of the tube-well; and his brotherUma Kant (P.W.2) was sleeping west side of Sariya on the way (rasta), which is adjacent to theChhappar where Ram Naresh and Sukai were sleeping. According to him, on the alarm of hisgrand-father Sukai and his uncle Ram Naresh cpkvks&cpkvks (save save), he (P.W.1) and his cousinbrother awoke and opened the door of tubewell and saw that Krishna Murari alias Murli and KashiRam armed with Gandasa and Raghav Ram and Ram Milan armed with Banka were causing hurt toRam Naresh and Sukai and 2-3 persons who had covered their faces by means of cloth were causinghurt to them by means of Banka and Gandasa both. On seeing this, he and his cousin brother Girishraised alarm. They ran to help his grand-father Sukai and cousin Ram Naresh, whereupon all theappellants started causing hurt to Girish and thereafter the appellants caused hurt to Ram Dev bymeans of Gandasa and Banka. After that, he ran inside the northern side of sugarcane field whereashis brother Uma Kant Verma (P.W.2) ran into the field, which is adjacent to Sariya and is towardsnorth. According to him, the electricity bulb was burning on the Neem tree situated south-west ofthe tube-well. There was another neem tree on which also electricity bulb was hanging and wasburning. He saw the occurrence in the light of the electricity bulb and identified the four appellants.On alarm, Ram Tej, Manik Ram (P.W.7), Munna Lal (P.W.8), Lallan Prasad Tiwari, Babu LalHarijan and several villagers came armed with lathies and with torches. Thereafter, all theappellants/miscreants ran away towards south. All the four injured persons died on the spot due toinjuries. He further stated that he did not go to lodge the FIR immediately due to fear in the night.In the morning, he went to police station Tarun on a bicycle along with P.W.7 Manik Ram, P.W.8Munna Lal Verma and one another person. While they were on their way to police station, then,State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/25Daljeet Singh (P.W.3) of village Jaisingh Mau and Hari Om Singh (P.W.4) of village Tikri told himthat last evening at about 09:00 a.m., on the shop of Ram Kripal Verma in Lal Ganj Bazar, he hadseen Ram Tilak Verma along with Krishna Verma and 2-3 other person taking non-vegetarian food.He stated that on this information, he was convinced that the conspiracy was hatched by Ram Tilak,Ram Kripal and Krishna Murari etc. to commit the murders. He reached the police station at 06:30p.m. and handed over written report (Ext. Ka.1) to the police.(40) According to P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma, who is brother of P.W.1- Rama Kant Verma , at the timeof the incident i.e. in the night of 10/11.11.1994. at about 02:30 a.m., he was sleeping in front ofSariya on the way (rasta) adjacent to the Chhappar and that in the western side of Sariya, there is afield of sugarcane and that his Chhappar of vkslkjk is adjacent to eastern side of his Sariya.According to him, the way, he was sleeping, was in between the Sariya and Chhappar in north-southand that this way (rasta) leads up to the northern chak road. He has stated that in the east of theSariya, his Osara has two rooms in which chaff/straw and grains are being kept and on that night,his uncle Ram Naresh and grand-father Sukai were sleeping on the separate Cots in that Osara(vkslkjk). There is tube-well east of Osara, and in between a Rasta runs which also leads to the chakroad. He further stated that on the night of the incident, his brother Rama Kant and his cousinGirish Chandra Verma were sleeping inside the tube-well, whereas in the south of the Chhappar,which also belonged to him, his grand-father Ram Dev was sleeping. There is a neem tree in thewestern side of his tubewell. On the date of the incident, an electricity bulb was burning in a branchof the neem tree, which was connected with tube-well. In the south direction of the Chapper, inwhich his grand-father Ram Dev was sleeping, there is an open ground and thereafter, there is hischapper. The eastern side of this chapper, there is a neem tree. On the date of the incident, anelectricity bulb was burning in a branch of the tree, which was also connected with the tubewell. Helistened the noise of cpkvksa cpkvks (save-save). On this noise, he woke up and saw that appellantsKrishna Murari and Kashi Ram armed with Gandasa and Raghava Ram and Ram Milan armed withBanka were causing hurt to his grand-father Sukai and his uncle Ram Naresh and apart from them,there were 2-3 other persons also who had covered their faces. They were also causing hurt to RamNaresh and Sukai. At that time, his brother Rama Kant and his cousin Girish came out of the roomof tubewell. They all raised alarm. Thereafter, the accused persons ran towards his brother RamaKant and cousin Girish for assaulting and started assaulting. In the western-southern side of thetubewell of Girish, Ram Dev was sleeping and they all ran for assaulting and started assaulting.Thereafter, he (P.W.2) and Rama Kant (P.W.1) ran towards north in the sugar-cane field by raisingalarm and hiding in the sugarcane. On alarm and noise, his father Tej Ram Verma, Manik Ram.Munna Lal, Lallan Prasad Tewari, Babu Lal and other persons of his village came with lathi andtorch whereupon the accused ran towards south. On the assault of the accused, his uncle RamNaresh, his grand-father Sukai, Ram Dev and cousin Girish Chandra Verma died on the spot.(41) Both P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma have stated that on the date ofoccurrence i.e. in the intervening night of 10.11.1994, at 02:30 a.m., Rama Kant Verma (P.W.1) wassleeping along with cousin Girish Chandra Verma (deceased) inside tube-well room after shutting itsdoor; his uncle Ram Naresh Verma (deceased) and his grand-father Sukai (deceased) were sleepingunder Chhappar on separate cots west of the tube-well; uncle Ram Dev (deceased) was sleepingunder the chhappar south of the tube-well; and Uma Kant Verma (P.W.2) was sleeping west of theState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/26Sariya on the Rasta (way), which is adjacent to the chhappar where Ram Naresh (deceased), Sukai(deceased) were sleeping. Both these witnesses i.e. P.W.1 and P.W.2 have further stated thatappellants Krishna Murari alias Murli and Kashi Ram were armed with Gandasa and appellantsRaghava Ram and Ram Milan were armed with Banka. They all and 2-3 other persons who hadcovered their faces by means of cloth and armed with Banka and Gandasa were causing hurt to theiruncle Ram Naresh (deceased) and their grand-father Sukai (deceased). They also stated that onseeing causing hurt, both Girish (deceased) and Rama Kant (P.W.1) raised alarm and ran to helpRam Naresh (deceased) and Sukai (deceased) and thereafter, all the appellants were causing hurt toGirish (deceased) by means of Gandasa and Banka and thereafter, they ran inside the sugar-canefield. They also stated that they saw the incident in the light of electricity bulb, hanging in thebranches of two Neem trees. They also stated that appellants and other assailants ran away, afterassaulting Ram Naresh, Sukai, Ram Dev and Girish,.(42) We have gone through the evidence of Rama Kant Verma (P.W.1) and Uma Kant Verma(P.W.2) and find them to be wholly truthful witnesses. Since they have furnished the same mannerof assault and while dealing with their evidence, we have found that their version in relation to theassault on the deceased is in consonance with medical evidence. Further, we find that they haveexplained their presence at the place of the incident. They have stated that they were sleeping thereon the date and time of the incident.(43) It is pertinent to mention that although P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Vermawere extensively cross-examined, nothing could be extracted there from which could impair theircredibility.(44) Earlier we have reproduced the ante-mortem injuries suffered by the deceased Ram Dev, RamNaresh, Sukai and Girish and seen that Ram Dev sustained two abraded contusion on the right sideforehead, twelve incised wounds on his face, neck, shoulder, fore-arms and one stab wound onlungs. His right clavicle, 4 ribs (3 to 7) on right side chest were found fractured; lung was also foundcut; semi digested food was present in the stomach; faecal matter was present in the intestines.The deceased Ram Naresh sustained thirteen incised wounds on head, face, neck, arms, wrist andhand. His left cervical was found fractured; Right side ribs (3 to 6th) were found fractured;semi-digested food was present in the stomach; faecal matter was also found in intestines.The deceased Sukai sustained four incised wounds on neck and fore-head. His right clavicle andright side 2nd to 7th ribs were found fractured; membrances of lungs were torned; right lung 7 cm x4 cm were cut; semi digested food and faecal matter was found in stomach and intestines.The deceased Girish sustained fifteen incised wounds on the head, hand, palm, knee, index finger.His occipital bone back side was fractured upto 3 inches; brain matter was coming out; semidigested food and faecal matter were found present.(45) Dr. O.P. Khatri (P.W.9) opined that all the dececeased died due to shock and haemorrahage as aresult of ante-mortem injuries. According to him, the ante mortem injuries suffered by the deceasedState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/27were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It has also been stated before thetrial Court by P.W.9 that the deceased could have died on 11.11.1994 at 02:30 a.m.; incised woundwas found on the lungs of the deceased Ram Dev; because of injury no.9, collor bone of the deceasedRam Dev was found fractured; injury no.9 of the deceased Ram Dev could be attributable by Banka;injuries no. 1 and 2 of Ram Dev could be attributable by banka or part of pool of Gandasa; and allthe ante-mortem injuries sustained by other deceased persons could be attributable by Banka orGandasa. P.W.9-Dr.O.P. Khatri was extensively cross-examined but nothing could be extractedthere from which could impair credibility of the evidence of the eye-witnesses P.W.1-Rama KantVerma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma. Both these witnesses have consistently stated that the deceaseddied on the spot as a consequence of the said injuries. Thus, we are of the considered view that thereis no material discrepancy in the medical and ocular evidence. There is no reason to interfere withthe judgments of the trial Court on this ground.(46) In any event, it has been consistently held by the Apex Court that the evidentiary value ofmedical evidence is only corroborative and not conclusive and, hence, in case of a conflict betweenoral evidence and medical evidence, the former is to be preferred unless the medical evidencecompletely rules out the oral evidence. [See Solanki Chimanbhai Ukabhai Vs. State of Gujarat,(1983) 2 SCC 174; Mani Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan, 1993 Supp (3) SCC 18; State of Haryana Vs.Bhagirath, (1999) 5 SCC 96; Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai Nayak Vs. State of Gujarat, (2003) 5 SCC 223;Thaman Kumar Vs.

The minor improvements, embellishments etc. apart from being far yield ofhuman faculties are insignificant and ought to be ignored since the evidence of witnesses otherwiseoverwhelmingly corroborates each other in material particulars.(48) It has been argued by the learned Counsel for the convicts/appellants that there was noimmediate motive with the appellants to commit the murder of the deceased.(49) However, the Trial Court found that there was sufficient motive with the accusedpersons/appellants to commit the murder of the deceased since 1990, litigation of land is going onbetween the family of the deceased and Krishna Murari. The long nursed feeling of hatred and thesimmering enmity between the family of the deceased and the accused persons most likelymanifested itself in the outburst of anger resulting in the murder of the deceased. We are notrequired to express any opinion on this point in the light of the evidence adduced by the directwitnesses to the incident.(50) It is a settled legal proposition that even if the absence of motive, as alleged, is accepted that isof no consequence and pales into insignificance when direct evidence establishes the crime.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/28Therefore, if there is direct trustworthy evidence of witnesses as to the commission of an offence,motive loses its significance. Therefore, if the genesis of the motive of the occurrence is not proved,the ocular testimony of the witnesses as to the occurrence could not be discarded only on the groundof absence of motive, if otherwise the evidence is worthy of reliance. [See Hari Shankar Vs. State ofU.P., (1996) 9 SCC 40; Bikau Pandey & Ors. Vs. State of Bihar, (2003) 12 SCC 616; State of U.P. Vs.Kishanpal & Ors., (2008) 16 SCC 73; Abu Thakir & Ors. Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (2010) 5 SCC 91and Bipin Kumar Mondal Vs. State of West Bengal; (2010) 12 SCC 91].(51) The next submission of the Counsel for the appellants is that the Investigating Officer has notrecovered any weapon of assault as alleged by the prosecution i.e. Gandasa and Banka. We feel noneed to address this issue since it had already been validly discarded by the trial Court whileconvicting the appellants. In any case, it is an established proposition of law that mere non-recoveryof weapon does not falsify the prosecution case where there is ample unimpeachable ocularevidence. (See Lokhan Sao Vs. State of Bihar : (2008) 16 SCC 73, Abu Thakir Vs. State of T.N. :(2010) 5 SCC 91, and Bipin Kumar Mondal Vs. State of West Bengal : (2010) 12 SCC 91.(52) The next line of contention of the learned Counsel for the appellants is that no independentwitnesses were examined to prove the prosecution case even though as per the prosecution caseitself, number of villagers came on the spot on hearing the hue and cry. We are not impressed by thissubmission in the light of the observations made by the Apex Court in Darya Singh Vs. State ofPunjab : AIR 1968 SC 328, wherein the Apex Court has observed as under :-"12. It is well-known that in villages where murders are committed as a result of factions existing inthe village or in consequence of family feuds, independent villagers arc generally reluctant to giveevidence because they are afraid that giving evidence might invite the wrath of the assailants andmight expose them to very serious risks. It is quite true that it is the duty of a citizen to assist theprosecution by giving evidence and helping the administration of criminal law to bring the offenderto book, but it would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that if the prosecution is not able to bringindependent witnesses to the Court because they are afraid to give evidence, that itself should betreated as an infirmity in the prosecution case so as to justify the defence contention that theevidence actually adduced should be disbelieved on that ground alone without examining itsmerits."(53) Similarly, in Raghubir Singh Vs. State of U.P., (1972) 3 SCC 79, the Apex Court has held that theprosecution is not bound to produce all the witnesses said to have seen the occurrence. Materialwitnesses considered necessary by the prosecution for unfolding the prosecution story alone need beproduced without unnecessary and redundant multiplication of witnesses. In this connection,general reluctance of an average villager to appear as a witness and get himself involved in cases ofrival village factions when tempers on both sides are running high, has to be borne in mind.(54) Further, in Appabhai and Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat, 1988 Supp (1) SCC 241, the Apex Court hasobserved that :State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/29"Experience reminds us that civilized people are generally insensitive when a crime is committedeven in their presence. They withdraw both from the victim and the vigilante. They keep themselvesaway from the Court unless it is inevitable. They think that crime like civil dispute is between twoindividuals or parties and they should not involve themselves. This kind of apathy of the generalpublic is indeed unfortunate, but it is there everywhere whether in village life, towns or cities. Onecannot ignore this handicap with which the investigating agency has to discharge its duties. TheCourt, therefore, instead of doubting the prosecution case for want of independent witness mustconsider the broad spectrum of the prosecution version and then search for the nugget of truth withdue regard to probability, if any, suggested by the accused."(55) The other submission of the learned Counsel for the appellants is that FIR number and distanceof police station from the place of occurrence, which find mention in the FIR, have not beenmentioned in the four Inquest Reports prepared by the two police officers under the supervision anddirection of the Investigating Officer and therefore, his contention is that the FIR was not lodged at06:30 a.m. but it was ante-timed. According to him, the special report was signed by the CircleOfficer only on 15.11.1994 although it is sent allegedly on 12.11.1994 and received in the office on14.11.1994, hence there is delay in sending the special report to the officer concerned. We are of theview that in any event, in the light of position of law examined above and the observation of the trialCourt that it merely shows remissness on part of the Investigating Officer, it should not be treated asfatal to the prosecution case, hence we are not inclined to disbelieve the prosecution story.(56) At this juncture, it would be relevant to mention that the Apex Court in a catena of decisionshas held that although in terms of Section 157 Cr.P.C., the police officer concerned is required toforward a copy of the FIR to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence, promptlyand without undue delay, it cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that wheneverthere is some delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, the prosecution version becomesunreliable and the trial stands vitiated. When there is positive evidence to the fact that the FIR wasrecorded without unreasonable delay and investigation started on the basis of that FIR and there isno other infirmity brought to the notice of the Court, then in the absence of any prejudice to theaccused, it cannot be concluded that the investigation was tainted and the prosecution storyrendered unsupportable. [See Pala Singh Vs. State of Punjab, (1972) 2 SCC 640; Sarwan Singh Vs.State of Punjab, (1976) 4 SCC 369; Anil Rai Vs. State of Bihar, (2001) 7 SCC 318; Munshi Prasad &Ors. Vs.

State of U.P., (2012) 6 SCC 107].(57) Further, the evidentiary value of the inquest report prepared under Section 174 of Cr.P.C. hasalso been long settled through a series of judicial pronouncements of the Apex Court. It iswell-established that inquest report is not a substantive piece of evidence and can only be lookedinto for testing the veracity of the witnesses of inquest. The object of preparing such report is merelyto ascertain the apparent cause of death, namely, whether it is suicidal, homicidal, accidental orcaused by animals or machinery etc. and stating in what manner, or by what weapon or instrument,the injuries on the body appear to have been inflicted. [See Pedda Narayan Vs. State of A.P., (1975) 4SCC 153; Khujji Vs. State of M.P., (1991) 3 SCC 627; Kuldip Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 1992 Supp (3)SCC 1; George and Ors. Vs.

State of Assam, (2010) 10 SCC 374].(58) In the present case, it is not the case of the convicts/appellants that they have been prejudicedby the alleged delay in dispatch of the FIR to the nearest Magistrate competent to take cognizance ofsuch offence. Moreover, in our opinion, the non-recording of certain relevant entries in the inquestreport do not constitute a material defect so grave to throw out the prosecution story and theotherwise reliable testimonies of prosecution witnesses that have mostly remained uncontroverted.(59) The learned Counsel for the convicts/appellants has then tried to create a dent in theprosecution story by pointing out inconsistencies between ocular evidence and the medicalevidence. However, we are not persuaded with this submission since the trial Court has categoricallyruled that the medical evidence was consistent with the ocular evidence and we can safely say that tothat extent, it corroborated the direct evidence proffered by the eye-witnesses.(60) At the cost of repetition, it would be relevant to mention that there is no material discrepancyin the medical and ocular evidence. There is no reason to interfere with the judgments of the trialCourt on this ground.(61) For the reasons above, the evidence of P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Vermainspire confidence and their evidence squarely establishes the involvement of appellants KrishnaMurari, Raghav Ram, Kashi Ram and Ram Milan in the incident. Therefore, we do not have anyreservations in our minds that the learned trial Court acted correctly in convicting Krishna Murari,Raghav Ram, Kashi Ram and Ram Milan for the offence punishable under Section 302 read withSection 149 I.P.C. and Section 148 I.P.C.(62) So far as Criminal Revision No. 14 of 2000, which has been filed by the informant Rama KantVerma (P.W.1) against the impugned judgment of acquittal of Ram Kripal and Ram Tilak, isconcerned, we find that P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma , in his cross-examination, has stated before thetrial Court that he did not recognize Ram Kripal Verma and Ram Tilak Verma at the time of theincident, meaning thereby that the P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma did not see these two accused personsto commit the offence of murder of the deceased. The evidence on record reflects that the allegationslevelled by the prosecution against these two persons are that they were conspiring to commit theoffence of murder of the deceased on the basis of presumption that these two persons had takennon-vegetarian foods with the convicts/appellants in the bazar. Except for this, there is no evidenceagainst these two persons to commit the offence of murder of the deceased.(63) On due consideration of the evidence on record, we are of the view that merely taking ofnon-vegetarian food with the appellants does not constitute conspiracy as the prosecution has failedto adduce any evidence which shows that on the conspiracy/instigation of Ram Kripal and RamTilak, appellants/convicts had committed the offence of murder of the deceased persons. Thus, thetrial Court has rightly acquitted Ram Kripal and Ram Tilak and there is no illigality or infirmity inthe impugned judgment with regard to acquitting Ram Kripal and Ram Tilak, hence CriminalRevision No. 14 of 2000 is liable to be dismissed.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/31(64) Now, while upholding the conviction of the convicts/appellants, we proceed to consider thequestion of 'death sentence' awarded to them by the trial Court under Section 302 read with Section149 IPC.(65) Capital punishment has been the subject-matter of great social and judicial discussion andcatechism. From whatever point of view it is examined, one indisputable statement of law followsthat it is neither possible nor prudent to state any universal form which apply to all the cases ofcriminology where capital punishment has been prescribed. Thus, the Court must examine each caseon its facts, in the light of enunciated principles and before opting for the death penalty, thecircumstances of the offender are also required to be taken into consideration along with thecircumstances of the crime for the reason that life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is anexception.(66) Before going into the legality and propriety of question of sentence imposed upon theconvicts/appellants, it is profitable to look at the various decisions of the Apex Court in the matter.The decision in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1980 SC 898 pronounced by theConstitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court stands first among the class making a detaileddiscussion after the amendment of Cr.P.C. in 1974. In this case, the Apex Court has held thatprovision of death penalty was an alternative punishment for murder and is not violative of Article19 of the Constitution of India. Relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are relevant and the sameare reproduced herein below:-"132. To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty serves any penological purpose is adifficult, complex and intractable issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views. For the purpose oftesting the constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death penalty in Section 302 of thePenal Code on the ground of reasonableness in the light of Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution, it isnot necessary for us to express any categorical opinion, one way or the other, as to which of thesetwo antithetical views, held by the Abolitionists and Retentionists, is correct. It is sufficient to saythat the very fact that persons of reason, learning and light are rationally and deeply divided in theiropinion on this issue, is a ground among others, for rejecting the petitioners argument thatretention of death penalty in the impugned provision, is totally devoid of reason and purpose. If,notwithstanding the view of the Abolitionists to the contrary, a very large segment of people, theworld over, including sociologists, legislators, jurists, judges and administrators still firmly believein the worth and necessity of capital punishment for the protection of society, if in the perspective ofprevailing crime conditions in India, contemporary public opinion channelized through the people'srepresentatives in Parliament, has repeatedly in the last three decades, rejected all attempts,including the one made recently, to abolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty, if deathpenalty is still a recognised legal sanction for murder or some types of murder in most of thecivilised countries in the world, if the framers of the Indian Constitution were fully aware -- as weshall presently show they were -- of the existence of death penalty as punishment for murder, underthe Indian Penal Code, if the 35th Report and subsequent reports of the Law Commission suggestingretention of death penalty, and recommending revision of the Criminal Procedure Code and theinsertion of the new Sections 235 (2) and 354 (3) in that Code providing for presentence hearing andsentencing procedure on conviction for murder and other capital offences were before theState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/32Parliament and presumably considered by it when in 1972-1973 it took up revision of the Code of1898 and replaced it by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it is not possible to hold that theprovision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for murder, in Section 302 of the PenalCode is unreasonable and not in the public interest. We would, therefore, conclude that theimpugned provision in Section 302, violates neither the letter nor the ethos of Article 19.200. Drawing upon the penal statutes of the States in U.S.A. framed after Furman v, Georgia, ingeneral, and Clauses 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill passed in1978 by the Rajya Sabha, in particular, Dr. Chitale has suggested these "aggravating circumstances":Aggravating circumstances : A Court may, however, in the following cases impose the penalty ofdeath in its discretion:(a) if the murder has been committed after previous planning and involves extreme brutality; or(b) if the murder involves exceptional depravity; or(c) if the murder is of a member of any of the armed forces of the Union or of a member of any policeforce or of any public servant and was committed-(i) while such member or public servant was on duty; or(ii) in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such member or public servant inthe lawful discharge of his duty as such member or public servant whether at the time of murder hewas such member or public servant, as the case may be, or had ceased to be such member or publicservant; or(d) if the murder is of a person who had acted in the lawful discharge of his duty under Section 43 ofthe CrPC, 1973, or who had rendered assistance to a Magistrate or a police officer demanding his aidor requiring his assistance under Section 37 and Section 129 of the said Code.201. Stated broadly, there can be no objection to the acceptance of these indicators but as we haveindicated already, we would prefer not to fetter judicial discretion by attempting to make anexhaustive enumeration one way or the other.204. Dr. Chitaley has suggested these mitigating factors:"Mitigating circumstances":- In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases, the Court shall takeinto account the following circumstances:(1) That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.(2) The age of the accused. It the accused is young or old, he shall not be sentenced to death.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/33(3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitutea continuing threat to society.(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated. The State shall by evidenceprove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions 3 and 4 above.(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated. The State shall by evidenceprove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions 3 and 4 above.(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he was morally justifiedin committing the offence.(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person.(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defectunpaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.207. We will do no more than to say that these are undoubtedly relevant circumstances and must begiven great weight in the determination of sentence.209. There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence; as thereare countervailing circumstances of aggravation. "We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computerall such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulatingsociety." Nonetheless, it cannot be over-emphasised that the scope and concept of mitigating factorsin the area of death penalty must receive a liberal and expansive construction by the courts in accordwith the sentencing policy writ large in Section 354 (3). Judges should never be bloodthirsty.Hanging of murderers has never been too good for them. Facts and figures albeit incomplete,furnished by the Union of India, show that in the past Courts have inflicted the extreme penalty withextreme infrequency - a fact which attests to the caution and compassion which they have alwaysbrought to bear on the exercise of their sentencing discretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore,imperative to voice the concern that courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines indicated byus, will discharge the onerous function with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern,directed along the high-road of legislative policy outlined in Section 354 (3), viz., that for personsconvicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. A real andabiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law'sinstrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases when the alternativeoption is unquestionably foreclosed."(67) In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (1983) 3 SCC 470, the Hon'ble Supreme Courthas made an attempt to cull out certain aggravating and mitigating circumstances and it has beenheld that it was only in ''rarest of rare' cases, when the collective conscience of the community is soshocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penaltyirrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty.In this judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court has summarized the instances on which deathState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/34sentence may be imposed, which reads thus:-"38. xxxxxxxxxxx(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability;(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the 'offender' also require to be takeninto consideration along with the circumstances of the 'crime'.(iii) Life Imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words death sentencemust be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishmenthaving regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, theoption to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised havingregard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances;(iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing sothe mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struckbetween the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised."39. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered:(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for lifeinadequate and calls for a death sentence?(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentenceeven after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour ofthe offender?40. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaidproposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed herein above, thecircumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would proceed to doso."(Emphasis supplied) (68) The issue again came up before Hon'ble Apex Court inRamnaresh & others v. State of Chhattisgarh reported in (2012) 4 SCC 257, whereinthe Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated 13 aggravating and 7 mitigating circumstancesas laid down in the case of Bachan Singh (supra) required to be taken intoconsideration while applying the doctrine of "rarest of rare" case. Relevant para of thesame reads thus:-"76. The law enunciated by this Court in its recent judgements, as already noticed,adds and elaborates the principles that were stated in the case of Bachan Singh(supra) and thereafter, in the case of Machhi Singh (supra). The aforesaid judgments,primarily dissect these principles into two different compartments - one being theState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/35"aggravating circumstances" while the other being the "mitigating circumstances".The Court would consider the cumulative effect of both these aspects and normally, itmay not be very appropriate for the Court to decide the most significant aspect ofsentencing policy with reference to one of the classes under any of the followingheads while completely ignoring other classes under other heads. To balance the twois the primary duty of the Court. It will be appropriate for the Court to come to a finalconclusion upon balancing the exercise that would help to administer the criminaljustice system better and provide an effective and meaningful reasoning by the Courtas contemplated under Section 354 (3) of Cr.P.C.Aggravating Circumstances:(1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed dacoity,kidnapping etc. by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offencescommitted by the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and criminal convictions.(2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another seriousoffence.(3) The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear psychosis in the public at large andwas committed in a public place by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to the lifeof more than one person.(4) The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to receive money or monetarybenefits.(5) Hired killings.(6) The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving inhumane treatment andtorture to the victim.(7) The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody.(8) The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully carrying out his duty likearrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of himself or another. For instance, murder is of aperson who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty under Section 43 Cr.P.C.(9) When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an attempt of murder of the entire familyor members of a particular community.(10) When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon the trust of relationship and socialnorms, like a child, helpless woman, a daughter or a niece staying with a father/uncle and isinflicted with the crime by such a trusted person.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/36(11) When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and meanness.(12) When there is a cold blooded murder without provocation.(13) The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks not only the judicial conscience buteven the conscience of the society.Mitigating Circumstances:(1) The manner and circumstances in and under which the offence was committed, for example,extreme mental or emotional disturbance or extreme provocation in contradistinction to all thesesituations in normal course.(2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a determinative factor by itself.(3) The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probabilityof the accused being reformed and rehabilitated.(4) The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and the defect impaired hiscapacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal conduct.(5) The circumstances which, in normal course of life, would render such a behavior possible andcould have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like persistentharassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of human behavior that, in the facts and circumstancesof the case, the accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence.(6) Where the Court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the crime was notcommitted in a pre-ordained manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission ofanother crime and that there was a possibility of it being construed as consequences to thecommission of the primary crime.(7) Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eye-witness though prosecutionhas brought home the guilt of the accused."(69) In the matter of Dharam Deo Yadav vs. State of UP reported in (2014) 5 SCC509, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held thus:-""36. We may now consider whether the case falls under the category of rarest of therare case so as to award death sentence for which, as already held, in ShankarKisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra (2013) 5 SCC 546 this Court laid down threetests, namely, Crime Test, Criminal Test and RR Test. So far as the present case isconcerned, both the Crime Test and Criminal Test have been satisfied as against theaccused. Learned counsel appearing for the accused, however, submitted that he hadno previous criminal records and that apart from the circumstantial evidence, there isState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/37no eye-witness in the above case, and hence, the manner in which the crime wascommitted is not in evidence. Consequently, it was pointed out that it would not bepossible for this Court to come to the conclusion that the crime was committed in abarbaric manner and, hence the instant case would not fall under the category ofrarest of rare. We find some force in that contention.Taking in consideration all aspects of the matter, we are of the view that, due to lackof any evidence with regard to the manner in which the crime was committed, thecase will not fall under the category of rarest of rare case.Consequently, we are inclined to commute the death sentence to life and award 20years of rigorous imprisonment, over and above the period already undergone by theaccused, without any remission, which, in our view, would meet the ends of justice."(70) In Kalu Khan v. State of Rajasthan reported in (2015) 16 SCC 492, the Hon'bleSupreme Court has held that:-"30. In Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of Maharashtra, the conviction of theappellant-accused was upheld keeping in view that the circumstantial evidencepointed only in the direction of their guilt given that the modus operandi of thecrime, homicidal death, identity of 9 of 10 victims, last seen theory and otherincriminating circumstances were proved.However, the Court has thought it fit to commute the sentence of death to imprisonment for lifeconsidering the age, socio-economic conditions, custodial behaviour of the appellant-accusedpersons and that the case was entirely based on circumstantial evidence. This Court has placedreliance on the observations in Sunil Dutt Sharma v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) as follows:(Mahesh Dhanaji case, SCC p. 314, para 35) "35. In a recent pronouncement in Sunil Dutt Sharma v.State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), it has been observed by this Court that the principles of sentencing inour country are fairly well settled -- the difficulty is not in identifying such principles but lies in theapplication thereof. Such application, we may respectfully add, is a matter of judicial expertise andexperience where judicial wisdom must search for an answer to the vexed question -- Whether theoption of life sentence is unquestionably foreclosed? The unbiased and trained judicial mind freefrom all prejudices and notions is the only asset which would guide the Judge to reach the ''truth'."(71) In the light of the above proposition of law, we are required to scrutinize the casein hand minutely to find out whether the case falls under the category of "rarest of therare case", whether imposition of death penalty, which is an exception, would be theonly appropriate and meaningful sentence and whether imprisonment for life, whichis the rule, would not be adequate and would not meet the ends of justice.(72) While awarding the death sentence to the appellants, the trial Court has drawn aconclusion that the appellants had committed the offence of murder of the deceasedwith pre-determined mind and pre-planned manner, hence the same comes in theState Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/38category of 'rarest of rare cases'.(73) From a perusal of the above, it is clear that the special reasons assigned by thetrial Court for awarding extreme penalty of death are that the murder waspre-meditated and pre-planned one, therefore, imposition of lesser sentence thanthat of death sentence, would not be adequate and appropriate. In thesecircumstances, the trial Court held that the balance-sheet of the aggravating andmitigating circumstances was heavily weighed against the appellants making it therarest of rare cases and consequently awarded the death sentence.(74) But, having gone through the facts and circumstances of this case, we find thatno evidence on record to establish that the convicts/ appellants committedpre-planned and pre-meditated murder of the deceased. At least, no such evidencehas been led by the prosecution to establish this fact. It comes out thatconvicts/appellants were causing injuries to the deceased and when they were doingso, even the witnesses also reached there, but that itself is not sufficient to hold that itis a pre-meditated or pre-planned murder.(75) It is true that the manner in which crime has been committed by the appellantsby Gandasa and Banka blows, is brutal, cruel and gruesome, but there is absolutelyno evidence to suggest as to what could be the reason for the appellants to committhe said offence. This could be because of frustration, mental stress or emotionaldisorder which would be the mitigating circumstances to be taken note of.(76) It is relevant to mention here that both the eye-witnesses P.W.1 and P.W.2 havestated that at the time of the incident, appellants Krishna Murari alias Murli andKashi Ram were armed with Gandasa, whereas appellants Raghav Ram and RamMilan were armed with Banka and apart from them, 2-3 other persons who hadcovered their faces by means of cloth were also having Banka and Gandasa. As perthe prosecution story, all the persons above were causing hurt to the deceased withBanka and Gandasa, on account of which, four deceased persons died on the spot. Asper the opinion of P.W.9 Dr. O.P. Khatri, ante-mortem injuries sustained thedeceased could be attributable by Banka and Gandasa. But both Rama Kant VermaPW-1 and Uma Kant Verma PW-2 have not been able to specify who amongstappellants and 2-3 unknown persons who covered their faces with the cloth, wereresponsible for the fatal injuries suffered by the four deceased. P.W.1 and P.W.2 havefailed to narrate the specific role of assault of weapon by the appellants upon thedeceased persons. Moreso, the appellants did not have criminal history.(77) After considering the above facts and circumstances of the case,, we are of theview that the instant case does not fall in the category of 'rarest of rare cases',warranting capital punishment. Hence, the death sentence awarded to theconvicts/appellants under Section 302 read with Section 149 of IPC is liable to beconverted into life imprisonment.State Of U.P. vs Krishna Murari @ Murli And Others on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155922165/39(G) CONCLUSION (78) In the result :-(A) Capital Sentence No. 01 of 2000 :-While affirming the conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offence punishable underSection 148 I.P.C. and the conviction of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 302read with Section 149 IPC, we set aside the 'sentence of death' awarded to the convicts by the trialCourt by means of impugned judgment dated 21.12.1999 and direct that for the murder committedby the convicts Krishna Murari alias Murli, Raghav Ram Verma, Kashi Ram Verma and Ram MilanVerma, they are sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death sentence.Appellants Krishna Murari alias Murli, Raghav Ram Verma, Kashi Ram Verma and Ram MilanVerma are in jail and shall serve out their sentence.Subject to this alteration in the sentence, Capital Sentence No.1 of 2000 is dismissed.(B) Criminal Appeal No. 14 of 2000 :-The appeal is partly allowed.
