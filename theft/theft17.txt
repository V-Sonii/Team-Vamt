Briefly stated, a complaint was filed by the complainant against the insurance company allegingthat the vehicle No. UK06-G-7145 owned by the complainant and insured with the respondent videPolicy No. 081202/31/08/01/00001697 for the period from 09.01.2009 to 08.01.2010 was stolenfrom the house of Sh. Viram Pal (a relative of the complainant) First Appeal No. 01 / 2014 on18.11.2009 at about 11'O'clock about which a report was lodged on 19.11.2009 in the Police Station ofthat area with FIR No. 376/09; after the due investigation, a final report was submitted to the courtconcerned which was accepted by the Court on 07.04.2010 and file was consigned to record room. Itis further alleged that the insurance company - respondent deputed Sh. Rajeev Kumar as Surveyor;he investigated the matter persuaded the complainant and Sh. Viram Pal that if they gave a letter inwriting that the vehicle in question was sold by the complainant for personal use to Sh. Viram paland Sh. Viram Pal also gave the same matter in writing that he had purchased the vehicle, then theSmt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/1claim will be paid to the complainant without any hurdle; on such persuasion the complainant andSh. Viram Pal gave such letter to the surveyor. Later on the Surveyor demanded some money for theearly payment of the claimant's claim, but the complainant refused to fulfill his demand saying shehad purchased the vehicle on loan, which is stolen. It is further alleged in the complaint that afterthe acceptance of the final report, the respondent - insurance company repudiated the claim of theappellant - complainant without any valid reason, thus, the respondent - insurance companycommitted deficiency in service by not paying the claimed amount, hence the complainant broughtthe claim against the insurance company to award the insured amount alongwith compensationwith costs.3. The Insurance Company - respondent has replied by filing its written statement that thecomplainant concealed the material facts and thereby purchased the insurance policy, hence theanswering respondent is not responsible to pay the same. It is also averred that as per the statementof the complainant and the Sh. Viram Pal, the vehicle in question was purchased in the year 2008after obtaining a loan of Rs. 4,40,000/- from the bank of which the installment of Rs. 15,000/- permonth was payable to the bank. In the month of 2008, the said vehicle was handed over to Sh.Viram First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 Pal after payment of Rs. 20,000/- to the complainant and it wasalso agreed upon between both that the per month installment of the total loan Rs. 4,40,000/- shallbe paid by Sh. Viram Pal and an agreement took place between both, since then the vehicle was inthe possession of Sh. Viram Pal. As the vehicle in question was sold to Sh. Viram Pal, therefore,there was no insurable interest in favour of the complainant, narrating all the facts, the claim of thecomplainant was repudiated by the respondent- Insurance Company.4. The Forum below after hearing both the parties to the case dismissed the complaint on08.07.2013.5. On having been aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the appeal in hand has been submitted inthe State Commission by the appellant - complainant with the prayer to set aside the impugnedjudgment and award the claim to the complainant.6. We have heard the argument advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and perusedthe record.7. A perusal of the record depicts that it is an admitted fact that the vehicle in question wasregistered in the record of Licensing Authority, wherein the claimant has been shown the registeredowner of the vehicle in question. It is an undisputed fact that the vehicle was insured with therespondent vide Policy No. 081202/31/08/01/00001697 for the period commencing from09.01.2009 till 08.01.2010, showing the claimant as its registered owner. It is also admitted fact thatthat the vehicle in question was stolen from the house of Sh. Viram Pal on 18.11.2009 about whichthe matter was reported to the concerned Police Station by Sh. Viram Pal. It is also admitted by boththe parties to the appeal that a FIR was lodged for the First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 stolen vehicle inquestion bearing FIR No. 376/09 on dated 19.11.2009 and the Police investigated the matter,submitted its Final Report before the court concerned. It is undisputed fact that Final Reportsubmitted on behalf of the Police to the concerned court was accepted vide order dated 07.04.2010Smt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/2and the file was consigned to the record room of the concerned department. It is also undisputedfact that the registered owner Smt. Sandeep Kaur informed the vehicle's insurance company aboutthe theft incident vide letter dated 20.11.2009 (paper No. 5/4 with courier receipt on the DistrictConsumer Forum record). It is admitted by both the parties that the claim of the complainant wasrepudiated vide letter dated 08.02.2011 (paper No. 5/1 of the District Consumer Forum record) onthe ground that the vehicle in question was sold to Sh. Viram Pal before the date of incident by theregistered owner. There was no insurable interest of the claimant in the vehicle in question on thealleged date of theft.8. Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that in the R.C., the name of the appellant isspecifically registered in the records of concerned Licensing Authority (department) and per monthinstallment was regularly paid by the registered owner and not by Sh. Viram Pal. It is also statedthat the loan was also sanctioned in the name of registered owner of the vehicle in question; noagreement to sell the insured vehicle was ever executed between the complainant and Sh. Viram Pal,therefore, the vehicle in question was not sold out to Sh. Viram Pal. It is further argued that theSurveyor has pressurized / persuaded the owner as well as Sh. Viram Pal by saying that if they wrotea letter in writing to this effect that the vehicle was sold from registered owner, Smt. Sandeep Kaurto Sh. Viram Pal, then the claim would be easily allowed to the registered owner but later on, theSurveyor demanded money to settle the claim for which the registered owner denied. It is furtheralleged that the above mentioned unlawful acts were not denied by the Surveyor by examing himselfin the court or by First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 submitting his affidavit on oath, therefore, thecontention and pleas made in the complaint is unrebuttable.9. In contra, learned counsel for the respondent - Insurance Company has placed his submissionthat the Surveyor has duly investigated the matter and submitted his report that the vehicle was soldbefore the date of incident and some transactions were made between buyer Sh. Viram Pal andseller Smt. Sandeep Kaur of the vehicle and to this effect both have given their written submission tothe surveyor which were enclosed with the Surveyor report.10. We have perused the survey report which bears paper Nos. 29/1 to 29/4 with enclosures. In hisreport, the Surveyor has mentioned that Smt. Sandeep Kaur on 08.10.2010 told in her writtensubmission that she purchased a vehicle in question from Swami Motors (P) Ltd., Chandigarh inJanuary, 2007, which is financed by the Bank of Baroda, Bajpur, she also apprised that the saidvehicle was sold to Sh. Viram Pal and received Rs. 20,000/- in cash and Sh. Viram Pal agreed torepay the remaining loan amount of Rs. 4,40,000/- to Bank of Baroda. The Surveyor has also statedin its report that Sh. Viram Pal has also given his written submission stating that he purchased theabove-said vehicle from Smt. Sandeep Kaur in March, 2008 and paid Rs. 20,000/- to her and heagreed to pay the remaining loan amount of Rs. 4,40,000/- by paying the bank installment; he paidRs. 1,50,000/- to the Bank till the time of theft.11. Here it is pertinent to mention that written submission of Sh. Viram Pal as well as of theregistered owner Smt. Sandeep Kaur are addressed to Chief Regional Manager of United IndiaInsurance Co. Ltd, Dehradun, Uttarakhand not to the Surveyor. The claimant has specifically allegedthat these letters were obtained by the Surveyor under pressure and persuasion First Appeal No. 214Smt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/3/ 2013 that if they gave a letter in writing that the vehicle was sold from registered owner to Sh.Viram Pal, then the claim would be settled and allowed. without any hurdle. This version is notdenied by the surveyor by filing his affidavit on oath. Moreover, for prove the sale of insured vehicleneither there is any such form (Form No. 29 & 30) available on record, which was executed betweenSh. Viram Pal and Smt. Sandeep Kaur, nor exists any document in order to show that the name ofthe Sh. Viram Pal as Registered owner has been changed in the record of licensing authority.12. We are very surprised to peruse the survey report that the survey report is undated. As per law,any document which is undated is not admissible in evidence as it has no importance having noevidentiary value, so such survey report is not admissible in evidence. The written submission of Sh.Viram Pal (alleged purchaser of the vehicle) (paper No. 29/5 on the District Consumer Forumrecord) also bears no signature of Sh. Viram Pal. So it is not admissible in evidence and on basis ofsuch written letter, sale of vehicle cannot be presumed.13. The learned counsel for the appellant - claimant has submitted a cited case law First Appeal No.77 of 2018: United India Insurance Company Limited vs. Sh. Surendra Singh Dhami decided on21.01.2022 by the State Consumer Commission, Uttarakhand, Dehradun and has argued that in thiscited case law, the State Commission has relied on the judgment passed by the Hon'ble NationalCommission in Revision Petition No. 3657 of 2011; National Insurance Company Limited vs. Mohd.Ishaq and others and hence further submitted that in the above cited case law it has been laid downthat if the survey report is not supported by affidavit of the surveyor, it cannot be taken intoconsideration. Relevant portion of paragraph No. 6 of the said decision is reproduced below:First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 "Therefore, in our view, the District Forum as well as theState Commission have very rightly rejected the report of the surveyor on the groundthat it is not supported by the affidavit of its author."The principle as laid down is applicable to this appeal.14. Learned counsel for the appellant has also argued that in the R.C., name of the claimant isindicated as registered owner so she is owner as per the definition of Section 2(30) of the MotorVehicle Act, 1988 and has insurable interest. Learned counsel has referred to a cited case law of theHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of (1) Civil Appeal No. 2632 of 2020; Surendra KumarBhilawe vs. The New India Assurance Company Limited, judgment dated 18.06.2020.We have perused the above cited case law, wherein it is held that:-"In our considered opinion, the National Commission erred in law in reversing theconcurrent factual findings of the District Forum and the National Commissionignoring vital admitted facts as stated above, including registration of the said truckbeing in the name of the Appellant, even as on the date of the accident, over threeyears after the alleged transfer, payment by the Appellant of the premium for theInsurance Policy, issuance of Insurance Policy in the name of the Appellant, permit inthe name of the Appellant even after three years and seven months, absence of 'NoSmt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/4Objection' from the financier bank etc. and also overlooking the definition of ownerin Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, as also other relevant provisions of theMotor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, including in particular thetransferability of a policy of insurance under Section 157.In view of the definition of 'owner' in Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, theAppellant First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 remained the owner of the said truck on thedate of the accident and the Insurer could not have avoided its liability for the lossessuffered by the owner on the ground of transfer of ownership to Mohammad IliyasAnsari."15. The above cited case law is applicable to the case in hand. In the R.C. the name of the claimant isshown as registered owner and she is the owner of the vehicle as per Section 2(30) of The MotorVehicle Act, 1988. It is also to note that there is no such written agreement on the record regardingthe sale of the vehicle in question between the claimant and Sh. Viram Pal. Therefore, it cannot besaid that vehicle was transferred or sold to Sh. Viram Pal. It is also noteworthy that FIR was lodgedby Sh. Viram Pal, which is available on record (paper No. 5/5 on the District Forum record), whereinSh. Viram Pal while reporting the theft incident to the Police Station has alleged that:"çkFkhZ ds ikl cqySjks thi jft0 u0 ;w0ds0 06 7145 gS tks fd lanhi dkSj iRuh Jh ekfudfxy fuoklh ] dkslh QkeZ cktiqj ftyk m/keflag uxj ds uke ij iathÑr gSA çkFkhZ fnukad18-11-09 dks le; jkf= 11%00 cts mijksDr cqyjs ks thi ls ckgj ls vk;k Fkk vkSj mijksDrthi ¼cqyjs ks½ çkFkhZ ds ?kj ds ckgj [kM+h dj nh Fkh vkSj e; ifjokj ls vius edku esalks x;k jkf= esa fdlh vutku O;fDr }kjk esjh mijksDr cqysjks pksjh dj yhA çkFkhZvylqcg mBk rks ns[kk fd thi fu;r LFkku ls xk;c gS eSaus vkl iM+kl s esa dkyksuh dspkSdhnkj ls Hkh bl lEcU/k esa iwNrkN dh ysfdu thi dk dksbZ irk ugha yx ldk] egksn;ls vuqjks/k gS fd esjh lwpuk ntZ djus dh Ñik dh tk;"The above mentioned report shows that had the vehicle in question actually been sold to Sh. ViramPal, then the Viram Pal would have been written down he has purchased the vehicle from Smt.Sandeep Kaur, but such facts was not mentioned in the FIR, which proves that the vehicle inquestion was never sold by the registered owner Smt. Sandeep Kaur to Sh. Viram Pal. The chik FIRproves contents of letters of the registered owner Smt. Sandeep Kaur (paper No. 29/6) as well as Sh.Viram Pal (paper No. First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 29/5) incorrect, wrong and unbelievable thatthere had been any sale transaction regarding the insured vehicle before the date of theft incidentbetween the above both mentioned registered owner and so called purchaser.16. The learned counsel for the appellant has also referred to cited case law "M/s Balwant Singh andothers vs. National Insurance Company Ltd. & anr., decided on 31.07.2019, (S.C) wherein theHon'ble Apex Court has held that-"In the present case, the court is dealing with a situation where following the transferof the vehicle, the insured was specifically informed by the Bank which held a lien onthe insurance policy, of the lifting of its lien following the termination of agreementSmt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/5of hypothecation. Following this, a policy of insurance was issued by the insurer.Admittedly, the payment of premium was made by the appellant. The Thirdrespondent did not set up any claim in respect of the loss of the vehicle since thevehicle had already been repossessed and sold by the bank on account of its default inthe payment of dues. The insurer cannot repudiate the claim of the appellant holdingthat its liability is to the third respondent who has no subsisting interest in theownership in the vehicle. The appellant has undertaken to furnish an indemnity tothe insurer against any claim at the behest of the third respondent. The transfer ofthe vehicle is not in dispute. The insurer adopted a basis which was unsustainable torepudiate the insurance claim. The loss of the vehicle took place in close proximity tothe date of auction purchase. We allow the claim in the amount of First Appeal No.214 / 2013 Rs. 2,42,000/- on which the appellant shall be entitled to interest at therate of 9% per annum from the date on which the claim was lodged until payment."The above cited case law is fully applicable to the case in hand. As per record, there is so such receiptof bank available on record that the monthly installment of loan was regularly been paid by thealleged purchaser Sh. Viram Pal. Sh. Viram Pal did not also set up any claim in respect of the loss ofthe vehicle stating he was the owner as per the sale agreement. The statements of account paperNos. 91 to 95 also reveal that till 08.10.2010 monthly installments were not paid per month. Theinsurance company did also not examine Sh. Viram pal in order to show that the insured vehicle wasindeed sold to him before the date of theft incident.17. The learned counsel has also referred to a case law. Iffco Tokio General Insurance vs. AnilSharma, decided on 17.09.2019 wherein the Hon'ble National Consumer Commission, New Delhihas held that-"From the perusal of the file and as also admitted by learned counsel, the petitionerhas not produced any document on record which could show that subject vehicle hadbeen sold by the insured to Ajay. The issue is as to who is the owner of the vehiclewhen there is no agreement on record to prove that vehicle stands sold. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 defines the term 'owner' as under:"Owner" means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and wheresuch person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehiclewhich is the subject of a First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 hire-purchase agreement, or anagreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of thevehicle under that agreement. It is not in dispute that claimant is the registeredowner of the subject vehicle. In view of the above, it is apparent that present revisionpetition has no merit. There is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.Revision Petition is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs, in limine."18. The learned counsel for appellant has also submitted the following cited cases:-Smt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/6(1) ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Sh. Madan Singh Chodhri, F.A. No. 103 of2018 decided on 29.11.2018 by Uttarakhand State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,Dehradun.(2) United India Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Sh. Mahendra Kumar, F.A. No. 259 of 2008 decidedon 12.10.2010 (3) HDFC Ergo General Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Sh. Balroj Singh, F.A. No. 111 of2012, decided on 13.03.2014 and argued that in above cases the State Commission confirmed thefinding of District Consumer Forum wherein the registered owner was held entitled to claim evenafter the execution of such agreement of the insured vehicle between the registered owner and thepurchaser.19. We have perused the above cited case law. In the case of "HDFC Ergo General InsuranceCompany Ltd." (supra) it was held when the vehicle was registered in the name of the complainantand the policy was also issued in his favour and there is no dispute regarding the theft of the vehicle,the insurance company was not at all justified in repudiating the claim of the claimant."First Appeal No. 214 / 201320. In the case of United India Insurance Company Ltd. (supra) it was held that -"it is of significance that the complaint merely admitted execution of agreement ofsale, but came up with the allegation that the sale was not finalized in terms of theagreement on account of non- payment of the agreed price of the vehicle. Thecomplainant also denied execution of the sale letter dated 03.03.2000 filed by theinsurance company which is not notarized and signatures of the parties to the allegedsale letter were, therefore, not duly verified before the statutorily recognizedfunctionary of the Government." and on the above basis the judgment of the DistrictConsumer Forum was confirmed.21. In the case of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd. (supra) it is held that "theinsurance company has placed reliance on the sale agreement dated 04.02.2008 wherein it has beenstated that the complainant has sold the subject vehicle to Sh. Surendra Singh for a sum of Rs.2,90,000/-, but the facts remains that on the date of loss, the complainant was the registered ownerof the vehicle and the insurance policy was also insured in his name. It would not be out of place tomention, hence that Sh. Surendra Singh Negi, the alleged current owner of the vehicle, has not comeforward to claim any compensation from the insurance company arising out of the accident FirstAppeal No. 214 / 2013 in question ........" holding the above mentioned finding, the appeal wasdismissed and the judgment of District Consumer Forum was confirmed.22. In the case of "Oriental Insurance Company vs. Kamal Tours and Travels, III (2011) CPJ 39(NC)" it has been held that:-"It is not in dispute that Respondent had got the vehicle insured with thePetitioner/Insurance Company which was involved in an accident causing loss of theSmt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/7vehicle and which was assessed by the Petitioners Surveyor at Rs.2,57,455/-. There is,however, credible documentary evidence in the instant case that at the time when theaccident took place, insuree had already sold the vehicle to another person. He alsodid not inform the Petitioner/Insurance Company regarding the sale of vehicle norwas the vehicle transferred in the name of the new owner.As stated by the Counsel for Petitioner, in a case under similar circumstances, thisCommission has given a clear ruling that if a vehicle is sold by the insuree to anotherperson without intimation to the insurance company then in case of any claimcovered under the insurance policy, the insuree ceases to have an insurable interest.The present case is squarely covered by our decision in New India Assurance Co. Ltd.Vs. Divya Prashad (supra). Regarding the point of the driver not having a validlicence at the time of driving the vehicle, although there is documentary evidence thatthe validity of the license of Pawan Kumar had expired in 1999 and only a duplicate(and not a First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 renewed) licence was issued to him in 2001,since this was not a part of the written statement filed before the District Forum norwas this pressed as an issue before the District Forum, in our revisional jurisdiction,we do not propose to take cognizance of this fact in deciding the case."23. In the case of United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. V.C. Deenadayal & Anr., III (2009) CPJ 260(NC), the Hon'ble National Commission has held that:-"Under the provision of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the registered owner of thevehicle should have informed the Transport Authority about the sale of the vehicleand the purchaser should have sought the incorporation of her name in the R.C. asthe transferee owner. Further, in order to avail the benefit of insurance, thepurchaser should have informed the Insurance Company within 14 days of itspurchase under Section 157(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 which admittedly hasnot been done in this case. After purchase of vehicle, the insurance policy has beenrenewed twice, i.e. from 3.2.2000 to 2.2.2001 and from 3.2.2001 to 2.2.2002. In thecircumstances, it is apparent that the complainants dishonestly combined theinsurance in the name of complainant No. 1 and dishonestly claimed 'no claimbonus'. The real owner complainant had neither registration in her name norinsurance. She has no insurable interest nor privity of contract with petition."First Appeal No. 214 / 201324. The principle as above laid down in the above mentioned cases are applicable tothe appeal in hand. The appellant has failed to prove that there was any writtenagreement between the registered owner and purchaser Sh. Viram Pal and on thebasis of such agreement the purchaser applied for change of his name as registeredowner to be incorporated either in the insurance policy or in the records of LicensingAuthority department. Apart from it, the insurance policy is also in the name of theclaimant and the purchaser has never applied for the change of his name in anySmt. Sandeep Kaur vs United India Insurance Company ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187266292/8department. Besides it, the alleged purchaser Sh. Viram Pal has not come forward toclaim any compensation from the insurance company arising out of the theftincident.25. As the insurance policy cover note, the insured vehicle was manufactured in the year of 2006and its insured declared value is shown as Rs. 3,80,000/-; the theft incident has taken place afterthe expiry of more than ten months from the date of commencement of policy, i.e 09.01.2009. Asper the survey report, loss is assessed to a sum of Rs. 3,74,000/- after the less of excess clause andimportance excess. Thus, in view of the above discussion, we are of the definite view that theinsurance company has resorted to deficiency in service in repudiating the genuine and legitimateclaim of the complainant and the District Consumer Forum was not justified in disallowing theconsumer complaint.26. We also hold that the learned District Forum has not passed the impugned judgment inaccordance with law; the impugned judgment is perverse, and is contrary to the mandate provisionsof law, hence it is liable to be set aside.27. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is hereby set aside. The complainantis allowed, the respondent - insurance First Appeal No. 214 / 2013 company is directed to pay Rs.3,74,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Seventy Four Thousand only) to the appellant - complainantwithin one month from today, in case of default, the insurance company shall pay simple interest atthe rate of 9% per annum from the date of impugned judgment till its actual realization. Therespondent - insurance company is also directed to pay Rs. 10,000/- as litigation charges and Rs.15,000/- as compensation for mental agony. The statutory amount, if any, deposited by theappellant at the time of filing the appeal be released in favour of the appellant. The record of theDistrict Consumer Forum, if any, be returned to the concerned Forum after expiry of statutoryperiod.      (BHAGWAT SINGH MANRAL)                        (MS.
