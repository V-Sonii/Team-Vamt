Chattopadhyay], JThe petitioner, hereinafter referred to as the detenu, has been detained pursuant to orderNo.F.15(9)-PD/2021(P-II)/2330 dated 20.08.2021 (Annexure-1 to this petition) issued by the HomeSecretary to the Government of Tripura in exercise of powers conferred under sub section (1) ofsection 3 of Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (forshort PITNDPS Act). [2] The grounds of detention as disclosed in the impugned order dated20.08.2021 are as under:[1]. From the records submitted by the Director General of Police, Tripura, it hasappeared that Shri Bishu Kumar Tripura S/O Shri Malindra Tripura of Lalmaibari,Near Padmalochan High School, PS-Melagarh, Sepahijala District was involved in thefollowing cases:(i) Melagarh PS case No. 2020MLG028 dated 19.06.2020 under sections148/149/353/325/427/307, IPC and section 3 of Prevention of Damage to PublicProperty Act and sections 20(b)(ii)(C)/29, NDPS Act.(ii) Manu PS case No.2021MNU004 dated 30.01.2021 under sections 20(C)/29(i) ofNDPS Act and, it has appeared that he is still operating through the help of hisassociates and supporters in transportation of NDPS articles.[2]. The records have also disclosed that he is a repeated offender and is continuously doing illegalactivities regarding transportation of NDPS articles. This is very dangerous for the society at largewhere several youths are heading towards drug addiction, which further decreases the nationalproductivity in all walks of life. Despite arrest in different cases said Shri Bishu Kumar Tripura S/OShri Malindra Tripura of Lalmaibari, Near Padmalochan High School, PS-Melagarh, SepahijalaDistrict did WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 3 of 18 not mend his ways and is continuouslyspoiling the future generation.[3]. The person is still active in illicit trafficking of NDPS articles as revealed from field informationbut could not be arrested red- handed again and issue of detention order under PITNDPS will alsohelp Police in initiating financial investigation laid down under Chapter-V(A) of NDPS Act.[4]. It is essential to keep Shri Bishu Kumar Tripura behind the bars in the national interest sincethis drug addiction not only spoil the individual drug addict but also spoils the career of youths.Under the influence of drugs, youths are easily motivated toward social crimes which may furtherlead to communal violence, hatred among communities and even international tensions, sinceShri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/2Tripura is having Indo-Bangladesh border. This drug addiction encourages youths to commit crimeslike snatching, theft of bike, burglary, dacoit etc. when they need money to fulfill their urge for drug.[5]. From the statement of witnesses and from the records, it has transpired that Shri Bishu KumarTripura has accumulated huge property at Bishramganj and Melagarh which appears to bedisproportionate to his known source of income.[6]. The Director General of Police, Tripura has proposed to prevent Shri Bishu Kumar Tripura S/OShri Malindra Tripura of Lalmaibari, Near Padmalochan High School, PS-Melagarh, SepahijalaDistrict from continuing his harmful and prejudicial activities by engaging himself in illicit traffic ofnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the interest of society. [3] The detenu was madeaware of the grounds of detention and copies of the documents relied on by the detaining authorityalong with the detention order was duly served on the detenu. He made a representation dated28.08.2021 [Annexure-9 to the writ petition] to the detaining authority. The said representation wasrejected by the State Government and the rejection order dated 18.09.2021 was communicated tothe detenu by the Home Secretary to the Government of Tripura [Annexure-10 to the writ petition].Thereafter, the State Government vide. No.15(9)-PD/2021(P-II)/2627 dated 14.09.2021 made areference in WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 4 of 18 respect of the matter to the State AdvisoryBoard in terms of section 9(b) of the PITNDPS Act. The Advisory Board opined that there weresufficient causes for the detention of the petitioner. Pursuant to report dated 06.11.2021 of the StateAdvisory Board, the State Government in exercise of power conferred under section 9(f) read withsection 11 of the PITNDPS Act confirmed the detention order for a period of 1(one) year w.e.f. thedate of his detention by order No.F.15(9)-PD/2021(P-II)/3283 dated 11.11.2021 (Annexure-12 to thewrit petition) issued by the Home Secretary.[4] The detenu has structured his challenges to the detention order mainly on the followinggrounds:(i) The orders whereunder the detenu was granted bail in Melagarh PS case No.2020/MLG/028 andManu PS case No.2021 MNU 004 prior to the issuance of the detention order were not placed beforethe detaining authority.(ii) Non placement of these vital documents before the detaining authority and non consideration ofthe same by the detaining authority has vitiated the detention order because those were necessary toarrive at a subjective satisfaction as contemplated under sub section (1) of section 3 of PITNDPS Actfor issuing detention order.[5] In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of State respondents 1, 2, 3 and 4 by the Deputy Secretary,Home, Government of Tripura on 20.12.2021, it has been asserted that the detenu is a drug peddleragainst WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 5 of 18 whom several cases have been registered. It isstated that the investigating agency has already laid charge sheet against him in Melagarh PS caseNo.2020/MLG/028 and Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004. In the third case lodged as BishalgarhPS case No.2021 BLG 059 under sections 20(b)(ii)(C) and sections 25, 27A, 29 and 32, NDPS Act, hehas been granted pre arrest bail by the High Court on 20.08.2021 and the State Government hasShri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/3decided to challenge the order in SLP before the Honble Supreme Court. Further averment made onbehalf of the State respondents is that invocation action of the provisions of PITNDPS Act againstthe detenu was felt necessary to deter him from repeating commission of offences under the NDPSAct. It has also been asserted by the State respondents that there is no merit in the petition becauseall procedural safeguards prescribed under the law has been followed by the detaining authority byaffording earliest opportunity to the detenu for making an effective representation against thedetention order and the matter was also referred to the advisory board within the timeframeprescribed under the law and pursuant to the report of the State advisory board the detention orderwas confirmed by the State Government.[6] A Separate counter affidavit was filed on behalf of Union of India (respondent No.6) by B.S.Meena, Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Revenue, Ministry ofFinance contending that the State Government forwarded the detention order to the CentralGovernment in terms of sub section (2) of section 3 of PITNDPS Act within WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of2021 Page - 6 of 18 the time stipulated under said sub section (2). It was received by the Ministry ofHome Affairs of the Government of India on 26.08.2021 which, in turn was forwarded to theDepartment of Revenue, Ministry of Finance. It was asserted in the counter affidavit filed byrespondent No.6 that there were no breach of safeguards provided to the detenu under Article 22 ofthe Constitution.[7] Notice was also served on State Advisory Board (respondent No.5) but no counter affidavit wasfiled on behalf of the said respondent. [8] We have heard Mr. Sankar Lodh, learned advocate for thepetitioner and Mr. S.S. Dey, learned Advocate General appearing for the State along with Mr. R.Datta, learned P.P, Mr. S. Debnath, learned Addl. P.P and Ms. A. Chakraborty, advocate.[9] Mr. Lodh, counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that the detention order passed by thedetaining authority is liable to be quashed mainly because bail orders whereunder detenu wasreleased on bail in Melagarh PS case No.2020/MLG/028 and Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004were not placed before the detaining authority and non consideration of the bail orders vitiated thesubjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. To buttress his arguments, Mr. Lodh, learnedcounsel has relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Rushikesh Tanaji Bhoite vs. State ofMaharashtra & Ors. reported in (2012) 2 SCC 72 wherein the Apex Court observed that in a casewhere the detenu was enjoying his freedom under the bail order passed by the court, at the time ofpassing the WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 7 of 18 order of detention, such bail order must haveto be placed before the detaining authority to arrive at proper satisfaction about the need ofpreventive detention. Counsel has relied on the following observation of the Apex Court inparagraph 9 and 10 of the judgment:"9. In a case where the detenu is released on bail and is enjoying his freedom underthe order of the court at the time of passing the order of detention, then such order ofbail, in our opinion, must be placed before the detaining authority to enable him toreach at the proper satisfaction.Shri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/410. In the present case, since the order of bail dated 15-8-2010 was neither placedbefore the detaining authority at the time of passing the order of detention nor thedetaining authority was aware of the order of bail, in our view, the detention order isrendered invalid. We cannot attempt to assess in what manner and to what extentconsideration of the order granting bail to the detenu would have effected thesatisfaction of the detaining authority but suffice it to say that non-placing and non-consideration of the material as vital as the bail order has vitiated the subjectivedecision of the detaining authority."[10] Counsel has further argued that preventive detention actually tantamounts to punishmentwithout trial. Therefore, detaining authority must record its subjective satisfaction in the detentionorder as to why issuance of the preventive order was necessary. Counsel submits that recourse topreventive detention cannot be taken as a substitute to an ordinary law and where recourse tocriminal proceedings would be sufficient to deal with the crime committed by the detenu, preventivedetention is not permissible. Counsel has derived support to his contention from the decision of theApex Court in the case of Rekha vs. State of Tamil Nadu through Secretary to Government & Anr.reported in (2011) 5 SCC 244 and the decision of the Apex Court in Munagala Yadamma vs. State ofWP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 8 of 18 Andhra Pradesh & Ors. reported in (2012) 2 SCC 386. Inthe case of Rekha (Supra) the Apex Court observed as under:"29. Prevention detention is, by nature, repugnant to democratic ideas and ananathema to the rule of law. No such law exists in the USA and in England (exceptduring war time). Since, however, Article 22(3)(b) of the Constitution of Indiapermits preventive detention, we cannot hold it illegal but we must confine the powerof preventive detention within very narrow limits, otherwise we will be taking awaythe great right to liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India whichwas won after long, arduous and historic struggles. It follows, therefore, that if theordinary law of the land (the Penal Code and other penal statutes) can deal with asituation, recourse to a preventive detention law will be illegal.30. Whenever an order under a preventive detention law is challenged one of thequestions the court must ask in deciding its legality is: was the ordinary law of theland sufficient to deal with the situation? If the answer is in the affirmative, thedetention order will be illegal. In the present case, the charge against the detenu wasof selling expired drugs after changing their labels. Surely the relevant provisions inthe Penal Code and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act were sufficient to deal with thissituation. Hence, in our opinion, for this reason also the detention order in questionwas illegal."[11] Mr. Lodh, learned counsel contends that in the case of Munagala Yadamma (Supra) the ratiodecided in the case of Rekha (Supra) was reiterated and it was held that where the offencescomplained of, can be dealt with under the ordinary law of the land, recourse to the provisions ofpreventive detention is contrary to the Constitutional guarantees enshrined in Article 22, 19 and 21of the Constitution and sufficient grounds have to be made out by the detaining authorities to invokeShri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/5such provisions. Counsel has relied on the following observation of the Apex Court in paragraph 7, 8and 9 of the judgment: WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 9 of 18 "7. Having considered thesubmissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are unable to accept the submissions madeon behalf of the State in view of the fact that the decision in Rekha case [(2011) 5 SCC 244], in ourview, clearly covers the facts of this case as well. The offences complained of against the appellantare of a nature which can be dealt with under the ordinary law of the land. Taking recourse to theprovisions of preventive detention is contrary to the constitutional guarantees enshrined in Articles19 and 21 of the Constitution and sufficient grounds have to be made out by the detainingauthorities to invoke such provisions.8. In fact, recently, in Yumman Ongbi Lembi Leima v.State of Manipur [(2012) 2 SCC 176] we hadoccasion to consider the same issue and the three-Judge Bench had held that the personal liberty ofan individual is the most precious and prized right guaranteed under the Constitution in Part IIIthereof. The State has been granted the power to curb such rights under criminal laws, as also underthe laws of preventive detention, which, therefore, are required to be exercised with due caution aswell as upon a proper appreciation of the facts as to whether such acts are in any way prejudicial tothe interest and the security of the State and its citizens, or seek to disturb public law and order,warranting the issuance of such an order.9. No doubt, the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant are such as to attractpunishment under the Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act, but that in our view has to be done underthe said laws and taking recourse to preventive detention laws would not be warranted. Preventivedetention involves detaining of a person without trial in order to prevent him/her from committingcertain types of offences. But such detention cannot be made a substitute for the ordinary law andabsolve the investigating authorities of their normal functions of investigating crimes which thedetenue may have committed. After all, preventive detention in most cases is for a year only andcannot be used as an instrument to keep a person in perpetual custody without trial. Accordingly,while following the three-Judge Bench decision in Rekha's case [(2011) 5 SCC 244] we allow theappeal and set aside the order passed by the High Court dated 20-7-2011 and also quash thedetention order dated 15-2-2011, issued by the Collector and District Magistrate, Ranga ReddyDistrict, Andhra Pradesh."[Italics supplied by us] WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 10 of 18 [12] Based on the aboveobservations of the Apex Court, counsel contended that in Melagarh PS case No.2020/MLG/028 aswell as Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004 the investigating agency has already laid charge sheetsagainst the detenu and the designated courts can very well take care of those charges under theordinary law and therefore, a preventive detention order is unwarranted. Under the premisesaforesaid, counsel has urged for setting aside the preventive detention order. [13] In order to repelthe submissions made by the counsel of the petitioner Mr. S.S. Dey, learned Advocate General hascontended that the plea raised by the detenu to challenge the order of his detention and the pointsargued by the counsel of the petitioner in support of such plea are wholly untenable. With regard tothe plea raised by the counsel of the petitioner about the the subjective satisfaction of the detainingauthority, learned Advocate General has contended that the detention order clearly demonstratesthat the detaining authority came to the conclusion about the dire need of the preventive detentionShri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/6of the petitioner after considering all the relevant materials. It has been argued by learned AdvocateGeneral that the adequacy of the material on the basis of which the detaining authority arrived at itssatisfaction cannot also be examined in the court of law. Even the reasonableness of the satisfactionof the detaining authority cannot be questioned. Counsel submits that all relevant facts anddocuments were considered by the detaining authority to arrive at a subjective satisfaction andcopies of all those documents were supplied to the detenu. Counsel WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page- 11 of 18 further contends that the detenu was completely aware of the bail orders passed by court inhis favour in Melagarh PS case No.2020/MLG/028 and Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004 andtherefore, non supply of the copies of the said orders to him could in no way prejudice the detenu.Moreover, the detaining authority has clearly indicated in the detention order that facts of MelagarhPS case No.2020/MLG/028 and Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004 were examined by the detainingauthority for arriving at the subjective satisfaction about the need of preventive detention of thedetenu. As contended by learned Advocate General, in this factual context, the bail orders cannot betreated as vital documents and non consideration of such documents has in no way vitiated thesubjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. Learned Advocate General argues that the ApexCourt has held that application for bail and an order made thereon, are not always mandatory andsuch requirement would depend upon facts of each case. To nourish his contention, counsel hasrelied on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Sunila Jain vs. Union of India & Anr. reportedin (2006) 3 SCC 321 wherein the Apex Court has held as under:"19.........................The detaining authority will have to satisfy himself on the basis ofthe materials placed on record, as to whether the order of preventive detentionshould be passed against the detenu or not. The constitutional mandate can be said tobe violated, provided : (1) the impairment has been caused to the subjectivesatisfaction to be arrived at by the detaining authority; and (2) if relevant facts hadnot been considered or the relevant or vital documents have not been placed beforethe detaining authority.WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 12 of 1820. In the instant case the order of detention has been taken note of the fact that the detenu hadalready been released on bail in the following terms:"You were arrested on 30-1-2003 and released on bail by the Honble Judge, SpecialCourt of Economic Offences, Bangalore, upon executing a personal bond for anamount of Rs. 10,000/- and security in the form of cash for the like sum."21. It is also not in dispute that a copy of the order granting bail and order of remand has beenfurnished to the detenu. In this view of the matter we are of the opinion that non-furnishing of acopy of the application of bail cannot be said to be a ground which impaired the subjectivesatisfaction of the detaining authority or the same was a relevant fact which was required to be takeninto consideration by him and the application for bail was required to be supplied to the detenu. It isnow well settled that all the documents placed before the detaining authority are not required to besupplied; only relevant and vital documents are required to be supplied.Shri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/722. As in the fact of this case, we are satisfied that the application for bail was not a vital document,copy whereof was required to be supplied to the detenu, in our opinion, the order of detention is notvitiated. A Division Bench of this Court in K. Varadharaj v. State of T.N. [(2002) 6 SCC 735] uponnoticing some of the decisions relied upon by Mr. Mani inter alia held:"6. From the above observations, it is clear that placing of the application for bail andthe order made thereon are not always mandatory and such requirement woulddepend upon the facts of each case."[Italics supplied by us] [14] It is contended by learned Advocate General thatapparently all documents which were vital and necessary for formation of subjectivesatisfaction of the detaining authority were placed before the detaining authoritybefore making the detention order on the basis of which the detaining authorityarrived at the conclusion that his preventive detention was necessary in order toprevent him from repeating the commission of such offence. In the given facts andcircumstances of the case, the bail WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 13 of 18 orderscannot be treated as vital and material documents to arrive at a subjectivesatisfaction inasmuch as such orders did not introduce any variation in thecircumstances which necessitated the preventive detention of the detenu.[15] In this background, the most vital question which falls for our consideration in this case iswhether the bail orders might have influenced the detaining authority in the formation of hissubjective satisfaction and whether non placement and non consideration of the same would vitiatethe order.[16] We have perused the entire record of the case and considered the submissions of learnedcounsel representing the parties. [17] It is not in dispute that Melagarh PS case No.2020/MLG/028was registered against the detenu on 19.06.2020 for commission of offence punishable undersections 148,149,353,325,427 and 307 IPC and section 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public PropertyAct, 1984 as well as section 20(b)(ii)(C) and section 29, NDPS Act in which the detenu was releasedon pre arrest bail by an order dated 04.07.2020 of the Special Judge, Sepahijala Judicial District inBA No.43 of 2020 and the ground of bail recorded by the learned Special Judge is that the materialswhich were placed before the court did not support his involvement in the commission of the allegedoffence. It is not also in dispute that after investigation of the case, police laid charge sheet againstthe detenu. It is also an admitted position that the detenu also got involved in Manu PS caseNo.2021 MNU WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 14 of 18 004 which was registered on 30.01.2021for commission of offence punishable under sections 20(b)(ii)(C) and 29 NDPS Act in which he wasarrested by police and after few days of remand he was released on bail by the Special Judge ofDhalai Judicial District by his order dated 23.03.2021 and in the said case also a supplementarycharge sheet dated 21.08.2021 was filed against the detenu. Subsequently, he got involved inanother case which was registered under the Bishalgarh police stations as BLG PS case No.059 of2021 for commission of offence punishable under sections 20(b)(ii)(C) and sections 25, 27A, 29 and32, NDPS Act and he was granted pre arrest bail by this court on 20.08.2021. On the same day, theimpugned order of detention was issued.Shri. Bishu Kumar Tripura vs The State Of Tripura on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196339835/8[18] From the facts stated above, it would appear that the detenu was granted bail in Melagarh PScase No.2020/MLG/028 and Manu PS case No.2021 MNU 004 prior to the date on which thedetention order came to be issued. In the detention order (Annexure-1 to the writ petition) noreference has been made to those bail orders. It is, therefore, assumed that those bail orders werenot placed before the detaining authority for his consideration at the time of passing the detentionorder. Whether such non placement and non consideration of the bail orders has affected thesubjective satisfaction of the detaining authority is the issue on which counsel of the parties haveplaced arguments and counter arguments. [19] Sub section (1) of section 3 of the PITNDPS Actpostulates that the Central Government or a State Government or any officer of the WP(C)(HC) No.04 of 2021 Page - 15 of 18 Central Government not below the rank of Joint Secretary who has beenspecially empowered by that Government and in case of State Government, any officer not below therank of Secretary of that Government specially empowered by the State Government for thispurpose, if satisfied, that with a view to preventing the person from engaging in illicit traffic inNDPS, his detention is necessary, may make an order directing detention of such person. Withregard to "satisfaction" contemplated under sub section (1) of section 3 of the Act, the Apex Court ina catena of decisions has observed that the satisfaction of the detaining authority to which section3(1) refers is his subjective satisfaction.[20] The argument which learned Advocate General has urged before us is that in the given factsituation, the bail orders were not vital documents for formation of the subjective satisfaction of thedetaining authority and as such non consideration of those bail orders has in no way caused anyimpairment to the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority because all relevant facts andvital documents were considered by the detaining authority at the time of passing the detentionorder. [21] Since, in the detention order there is no reference to the bail orders, the order ex faciesays that those orders were not placed before the detaining authority and as a result the detainingauthority at the time of passing the detention order was not aware of the fact that the detenu wasgranted bail in those cases and no challenge against those orders were raised by the State in thehigher forum. Absence of awareness of such WP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 16 of 18 essentialfacts on the part of the detaining authority, in our view, resulted in non application of mind whichobviously affected the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. None can say with certaintythat such bail orders, if placed before the detaining authority and considered by such authoritywould not have persuaded him to desist from passing such order of detention. In the case of M.Ahamedkutty vs. Union of India & Anr. reported in (1990) 2 SCC 1 the Apex Court held that nonconsideration of the bail order amounted to non application of mind. We can profitably quote thefollowing observation made by the Apex Court in paragraph 25 of the judgment which is as under:"25. Non-consideration of the bail order would have, therefore, in this case amountedto non-application of mind. In Union of India v. Manoharlal Narang, (1987) 2 SCC241, the Supreme Courts interim order in pending appeal against High Courtsquashing of a previous order of detention against the same detenu was notconsidered by the detaining authority while making the impugned subsequent orderagainst him. By the interim order Supreme Court had permitted the detenu to be atlarge on condition of his reporting to the police station daily. It was held that non-Shri.

If the detaining authorityconsidered that order one could not state with definiteness which way his subjective satisfactionwould have reacted and it could have persuaded the detaining authority to desist from passing theorder of detention. If in the instant case the bail order on condition of the detenus reporting to thecustoms authorities was not considered the detention order itself would have been affected.Therefore, it cannot be held that while passing the detention order the bail order was not relied onby the detaining authority. In S. Gurdip Singh v. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 419, following IchhuDevi Choraria v. Union of India (1980) 4 SCC 531 and Shalini Soni v. Union of India (1980) 4 SCC544 it was reiterated that if the documents which formed the basis of the order of detention were notserved on the detenu along with the grounds of detention, in the eye of law there would be no serviceWP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021 Page - 17 of 18 of the grounds of detention and that circumstances wouldvitiate his detention and make it void ab initio."[Italics supplied by us] [22] In our considered view, the bail orders were the most pertinent andproximate matters which cannot be discarded as irrelevant and remote in the given fact situation ofthe case and as such those orders should have been placed before the detaining authority forconsideration and arriving at a subjective satisfaction as contemplated under sub section (1) ofsection 3 of PITNDPS Act to arrive at a conclusion with regard to the necessity of the preventivedetention of the detenu. [23] In the case of Rekha (Supra) which has been relied on by the counsel ofthe petitioner, the detention order was held to be bad by the Apex Court as the detaining authoritywas not made aware of the fact that a bail application of the detenu was pending on the date whenthe detention order was passed. In the case of Rushikesh Tanaji Bhoite (Supra) which has beenrelied on by the counsel of the petitioner, the Apex Court has clearly observed that non placing andnon consideration of a material as vital as the bail order vitiates the subjective decision of thedetaining authority.[24] Therefore, we are of the view that in the given facts and circumstances of the case, the orderswhereunder the detenu was granted bail in the cases referred to in the detention order were relevantand vital documents and non consideration of those documents by the detaining WP(C)(HC) No. 04of 2021 Page - 18 of 18 authority has resulted in his non application of mind which has vitiated thedetention order passed by him.[25] For the foregoing reasons, the petition stands allowed and the impugned detention order dated20.08.2021 of Bishu Kumar Tripura is set aside.[26] The detenu is to be set at liberty at once unless his detention is required in any other case.[27] In terms of the above, the writ petition stands disposed of. Pending application(s), if any, shallalso stand disposed of. (S.G. CHATTOPADHYAY), J (INDRAJIT MAHANTY), CJ RudradeepWP(C)(HC) No. 04 of 2021Shri.
