SAHOO, J. The petitioner has knocked at the portals of this Court for grant of anticipatory bailunder section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure apprehending arrest in connection with JakhapuraP.S. Case No. 06 of 2022 corresponding to C.T. Case No. 102 of 2022 pending in the Court ofJ.M.F.C., Jajpur Road for // 2 // commission of offences under section 379 of the Indian Penal Coderead with section 21 of the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereafter'M.M.D.R. Act').2. The case of the prosecution, in short, is that basing on a public complaint received from thevillagers regarding theft of morrum by the petitioner, the Tahasildar, Danagadi vide letter No.318dated 25.01.2022 lodged a written report before the Inspector in-charge of Jakhapura police stationstating therein that on receipt of the aforesaid complaint, R.I., Danagadi duly enquired into thePrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/1matter and reported that the petitioner, who is a resident of Jakhapura is involved in theft of 8000cum of morrum from the land measuring an area Ac.55.00 of Khata No.419, Plot No.865, kissamSalajangal of mouza- Jakhapura. He requested the Inspector in-charge of Jakhapura to register theF.I.R. against the petitioner and take immediate action.On the basis of such first information report, Jakhapura P.S. Case No.06 dated 26.01.2022 wasregistered under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 21 of the M.M.D.R Actagainst the petitioner.3. Mr. Sidhartha Das, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that due to political rivalry, thecase has been falsely instituted and none of the villagers alleged anything against the // 3 //petitioner regarding theft of morrum and the petitioner is a local man and there is no chance of hisabsconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence. Learned counsel urged that the ingredientsof the offence under section 21 of the M.M.D.R. Act are not attracted in the factual scenario andmoreover, such offence is triable by the Special Court but no Special Court has yet been constitutedin the State of Odisha in spite of the provision under section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act and a Courtcan take cognizance of any offence punishable under the M.M.D.R.Act or the rules made thereunder only upon a complaint in writing made by a person authorised inthis behalf by the Central Government or the State Government and therefore, the anticipatory bailapplication may be favourably considered.4. On such submission being made by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Registry of thisCourt was asked to get information as to whether any Special Court has been constituted in the Stateof Odisha in view of section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act and the answer was in negative.Taking into account the importance of the matter regarding non-constitution of Special Courts inthe State of Odisha to try the offences under M.M.D.R. Act, the learned Advocate General wasrequested to remain present to assist the // 4 // Court during the hearing of the anticipatory bailapplication and he graciously assisted this Court without taking any side and fairly submitted thatthe State Government has not yet constituted any Special Court in terms of the provisions undersection 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act.The learned Advocate General submitted on 09.02.2022 that he has obtained instruction that onlyten cases under M.M.D.R. Act which relates to the Vigilance Cases are pending in the State ofOdisha. When it was pointed out to him that there are number of police cases pending in differentpolice stations for investigation and also in different Courts for trial wherein apart from the offencesunder various sections of Indian Penal Code, offence under section 21 of the M.M.D.R. Act has beenadded and the learned Magistrates are also trying such offences even though section 30-B of theM.M.D.R. Act requires the constitution of the Special Courts for speedy trial of the offences forcontravention of the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A) of section 4 of the M.M.D.R.Act and the Special Court is the competent Court to try the offence under section 21 of the M.M.D.R.Act along with other connected offences under Indian Penal Code offences in view of the ratio laiddown in the case of Pradeep S. Wodeyar -Vrs.- State of // 5 // Karnataka reported in (2022) 85Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/2Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 477, as per order dated 09.02.2022, this Court requested the learnedAdvocate General to apprise this Court as to how many P.S. Cases have been instituted/pendingunder section 21 of the M.M.D.R. Act along with the offences under Indian Penal Code, particularly,in some of those districts where such offences are rampant. Simultaneously, this Court also directedthe registry to call for a report from the learned District Judges of the State indicating how manyP.S. Cases involving offences under M.M.D.R. Act are subjudiced in their respective judgeship.The learned Advocate General has furnished the lists of cases pending in different police stations inthe districts of Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Mayurbhanj, from which it appears that total number ofcases registered in the aforesaid districts under the M.M.D.R. Act along with the offences under theIndian Penal Code are 195, 251 and 99 respectively.The learned District Judges of the State have also furnished their respective reports indicating thenumbers of cases subjudiced under the M.M.D.R. Act, the details are given below:Name of the districts Nos. of cases Sl. pending No.                    // 6 //5.    Bhadrak                 Nil6.    Bargarh                 Nil10.

Act, 1957 is the Central Act which governs the development andregulation of mines and minerals in terms of the powers vested in the CentralGovernment. The provisions of the M.M.D.R. Act extend to the whole of India. StateGovernments have to regulate the mines and minerals in terms of the M.M.D.R. Act.Prior to the comprehensive amendment made in the M.M.D.R. Act in 2015, therehave been amendments several times over the years, notably in 1972, 1986, 1994 and1999. The salient features of M.M.D.R. Amendment Bill 2015 are as follows:-(i) Removal of discretion; auction to be sole method of allotment: The amendmentseeks to bring in utmost transparency by introducing auction mechanism for thegrant of mineral concessions. The tenure of mineral leases has been increased fromthe existing 30 years to 50 years. There is no provision for renewal of leases.(ii) Impetus to the mining sector: The mining industry has been aggrieved due to thesecond and subsequent renewals remaining pending. In fact, this has led to closure ofa large number of mines. The Bill addresses this issue also. The Bill provides thatmining leases would be deemed to be extended from the date of their last renewal to31st March, 2030 (in the case of captive // 8 // mines) and till 31st March, 2020 (forthe merchant miners) or till the completion of the renewal already granted, if any, ora period of fifty years from the date of grant of such leave, whichever is later.(iii) Safeguarding interest of affected persons: There is provision to establish District MineralFoundation in the districts affected by mining related activities.(iv) Encouraging exploration and investment: The Bill proposes to set up a National MineralExploration Trust created out of contributions from the mining lease holders, in order to have adedicated fund for encouraging exploration in the country. Transfer of mineral concessions grantedthrough auction will be permitted in order to encourage private investors.Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/4(v) Simplification of procedures and removal of delay: The amendment removes the need for"previous approval" from the Central Government for grant of mineral concessions in case ofimportant minerals like iron ore, bauxite, manganese etc. thereby making the process quicker andsimpler. Similarly, the State Governments will devise a system for filling of a mining plan obviatingthe need for prior approval of the Mining Plans by the Central Government. The CentralGovernment will have revision // 9 // powers in case State Governments fail to decide issues withinthe prescribed time.(vi) Stronger provisions for checking illegal mining: In order to address the serious problem ofillegal mining, the penal provisions have been made further stringent by prescribing higherpenalties up to 5 lakh rupees per hectare and imprisonment up to 5 years. State Governments willnow be able to set up Special Courts for trial of offenses under the Act."Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act which was inserted by Act 10 of 2015 (w.e.f. 12.01.2015) reads asfollows:-"30-B. Constitution of Special Courts.-(1) The State Government may, for thepurposes of providing speedy trial of offences for contravention of the provisions ofsub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A) of section 4, constitute, by notification, as manySpecial Courts as may be necessary for such area or areas, as may be specified in thenotification.(2) A Special Court shall consist of a Judge who shall be appointed by the StateGovernment with the concurrence of the High Court.(3) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a judge of a Special Courtunless he is or has been a District and Sessions Judge.// 10 // (4) Any person aggrieved by the order of the Special Court may prefer anappeal to the High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of such order."Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act empowers the State Government to constitute as many SpecialCourts as may be necessary, by notification, to provide speedy trial of the offences for contraventionof the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A) of section 4 of the M.M.D.R. Act. Section 4 ofthe M.M.D.R. Act deals with the aspect of prospecting or mining operation to be under licence orlease. Both the aforesaid sub-sections of section 4 are quoted here-in-below:4. Prospecting or mining operations to be under licence or lease.-(1) No person shallundertake any reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations in any area, exceptunder and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a reconnaissance permit orof a prospecting licence or, as the case may be, of a mining lease, granted under thisAct and the rules made thereunder:Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/5Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall affect any prospecting or miningoperations undertaken in any area in accordance with terms and conditions of aprospecting licence or mining // 11 // lease granted before the commencement of thisAct which is in force at such commencement:Provided further that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to any prospecting operations undertaken by the Geological Survey of India, theIndian Bureau of Mines, the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research of theDepartment of Atomic Energy of the Central Government, the Directorates of Mining and Geologyof any State Government (by whatever name called), and the Mineral Exploration CorporationLimited, a Government company within the meaning of clause (45) of section 2 of the CompaniesAct, 2013 (18 of 2013), and any other entities including private entities that may be notified for thispurpose, subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Central Government;Provided also that nothing in this sub- section shall apply to any mining lease (whether calledmining lease, mining concession or by any other name) in force immediately before thecommencement of this Act in the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu.(1-A) No person shall transport or store or cause to be transported or stored any mineral otherwisethan in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder."// 12 // During hearing of the case, the learned Advocate General made a positive statement that theState Government is not against setting up of Special Courts in terms of section 30-B of theM.M.D.R. Act for trial of the offences in certain specified districts of the State where such crimes arefrequently reported and is prepared to take effective steps in that regard, however he emphasized onthe word 'may' appearing in the section.According to him, the legislature by using such word 'may' has given discretion on the StateGovernment to establish the Special Courts and therefore, it should not be construed as mandatory.In the case of State of Bombay -Vrs.- K. P.Krishnan reported in A.I.R. 1960 S.C. 1223, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was concerned with the'discretion' conferred on the Government by section 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 torefer industrial disputes for adjudication. The Court held that though the word used in thisconnection is 'may', that power is coupled with duty, because of which the word 'may' must mean'shall'. This shows that when a power is coupled with duty, its exercise almost ceases to bediscretionary and it becomes mandatory.In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh -Vrs.-Jogendra Singh reported in A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1618, it is held // 13 // that when a discretion isconferred upon a public authority, which is coupled with an obligation, the word 'may', whichPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/6denotes discretion, should be construed to mean a command. The Court further held that thelegislature uses the word 'may' out of deference to the high status of the authority on whom thepower and the obligation are intended to be conferred and imposed, but the word 'may' in such asituation is capable of meaning 'must'.Law is well settled that mere use of word 'may' or 'shall' is not conclusive. The question whether aparticular provision of a statute is directory or mandatory cannot be resolved by laying down anygeneral rule of universal application.Such controversy has to be decided by ascertaining the intention of the Legislature and not bylooking at the language in which the provision is clothed and for finding out the legislative intent,the Court must examine the scheme of the Act, purpose and object underlying the provision,consequences likely to ensue or inconvenience likely to result if the provision is read one way or theother and many more considerations relevant to the issue.(Ref: Bachahan Devi and Ors. -Vrs.- Nagar Nigam, Gorakhpur : (2008) 12 Supreme Court Cases372).State of Odisha is endowed with vast resources of a variety of minerals and occupies a prominentplace in the // 14 // country as a mineral rich State. Currently, Odisha is endowed with about onethird of the estimated national mineral resources.Abundant reserves of high grade Iron ore, Bauxite, Chromite, Manganese ore along with otherminerals such as, coal, limestone, dolomite, tin, nickel, vanadium, lead, graphite, gold, gemstone,diamond, dimension and decorative stones etc. are extensively available in the State of Odisha.Occupying an important position on the country's map, the rich minerals reserves of Odishaconstitute 28% iron ore, 24% Coal, 59% Bauxite and 98% Chromite of India's total deposits. Thishas opened up immense possibilities for locating mineral based industries for manufacture of Steel,Ferroalloys, Cement, Alumina/Aluminium, Refractories and Thermal Power etc. along with settingup other auxiliary and ancillary downstream industries. Apart from supporting thousands of jobs,the mining industries provide raw materials, minerals and metals critical to our economy. Theyprovide the foundations for modern living, innovation, engineering and achievements. As per thereports available in the website, there are 243 numbers of various mines existing in the State ofOdisha as on 4th March 2020. The rich minerals wealth of the State of Odisha is attributed to itsfavourable geographical set up. Mined materials are needed to // 15 // construct roads andhospitals, to build automobiles and houses, to make computers and satellites, to generate electricityand to provide many other goods and services that consumers enjoy. In addition, mining iseconomical important for any State and the country.The list submitted by the learned Advocate General relating to the number of cases reported underthe M.M.D.R. Act in three different districts, namely, Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Mayurbhanjindicates that it is increasing from time to time. The reports submitted by learned District Judges asindicated show about the pendency of the cases under the M.M.D.R. Act in most of the districts. It isalso reported that the trials under the M.M.D.R. Act cases are being conducted by the learnedPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/7Magistrates.At this juncture, it would be profitable to discuss the two decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Courtplaced by the learned Advocate General, i.e. Kanwar Pal Singh -Vrs.- State of Uttar Pradesh andanother reported in (2020) 14 Supreme Court Cases 331 and Jayant and others -Vrs.-State of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2021) 2 Supreme Court cases 670.// 16 // In the case of Kanwar Pal Singh (supra), the order of the Allahabad High Court indismissing petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal prosecution, inter alia, forcommission of offences under sections 4 and 21 of the M.M.D.R.Act was under challenge. The contention was raised that as per section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act, noCourt can take cognizance of offences under the M.M.D.R. Act except on a complaint in writing by aperson authorized by the Central or State Government. The State police not being authorized couldnot have filed the charge sheet/complaint. The Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon the decision ofthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State (NCT of Delhi) -Vrs.-Sanjay reported in (2014) 9Supreme Court Cases 772 and other decisions and held as follows :"15. We would again advert to the decision in Sanjay (supra) which had overruled thedecision of the Calcutta High Court in Seema Sarkar -Vrs.- State: (1995) 1 Cal LT 95wherein the High Court held the proceedings to be invalid and illegal as theMagistrate had taken cognizance on the basis of a charge sheet submitted by thepolice under section 21(2) of the M.M.D.R. Act and section 379 of the Indian PenalCode, observing that the cognizance was one that cannot be split or divided. The HighCourt had further observed that as the complaint // 17 // was not made in terms ofsection 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957, the cognizance was bad and contrary to law. Wehave already noted the decision of the Delhi High Court which had directed that theF.I.R. should not be treated as registered under section 379 of the Indian Penal Codebut only under section 21 of the M.M.D.R.Act, 1957. These decisions of the Calcutta High Court and the Delhi High Court were reversed andset aside by this Court in Sanjay (supra) after referring to section 26 of the General Clauses Act andthe meaning of the expression 'same offence', to observe that the offence under section 21 read withsection 4 of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 and section 379 of the Indian Penal Code are different anddistinct. The aforesaid reasoning compels us to reject the contention of the Appellant that the actionas impugned in the F.I.R. is a mere violation of section 4 which is an offence cognizable only undersection 21 of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 and not under any other law. There is no bar on the Court fromtaking cognizance of the offence under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code. We would also observethat the violation of section 4 being a cognizable offence, the police could have always investigatedthe same, there being no bar under the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957, unlike section 13(3)(iv) of the TOHOAct.// 18 //Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/816. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we would uphold the order of the High Court refusing to setaside the prosecution and cognizance of the offence taken by the learned Magistrate under section379 IPC and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. We would,however, clarify that prosecution and cognizance under section 21 read with section 4 of the MMDRAct, 1957 will not be valid and justified in the absence of the authorisation. Further, ourobservations in deciding and answering the legal issue before us should not be treated as findings onthe factual allegations made in the complaint. The trial Court would independently apply its mind tothe factual allegations and decide the charge in accordance with law. In light of the aforesaidobservations, the appeal is partly allowed, as we have upheld the prosecution and cognizance of theoffence under section 379 IPC and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public PropertyAct."In the case of Jayant and others (supra), where the common judgment and order passed by MadhyaPradesh High Court in dismissing the applications under sections 482 of Cr.P.C.to quash the first information reports registered for the offences, inter alia, under sections 4/21 ofthe M.M.D.R. Act was challenged, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-// 19 // "21.1. That the learned Magistrate can in exercise of powers under Section 156(3) of theCode order/direct the In-charge/SHO of the police station concerned to lodge/register crimecase/F.I.R. even for the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act and the Rules made thereunder and at thisstage the bar under Section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act shall not be attracted.21.2. The bar under Section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act shall be attracted only when the learnedMagistrate takes cognizance of the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act and the Rules made thereunderand orders issuance of process/summons for the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act and the Rulesmade thereunder. 21.3. For commission of the offence under I.P.C., on receipt of the police report,the Magistrate having jurisdiction can take cognizance of the said offence without awaiting thereceipt of complaint that may be filed by the Authorised Officer for taking cognizance in respect ofviolation of various provisions of the M.M.D.R. Act and the Rules made thereunder. 21.4. That inrespect of violation of various provisions of the M.M.D.R. Act and the Rules made thereunder, whena Magistrate passes an order under Section 156(3) of the Code and directs the In-charge/SHO of thepolice station concerned to register/lodge the crime case/F.I.R. in respect of the violation of various// 20 // provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder and thereafter after investigation theIn-charge of the police station/investigating officer concerned submits a report, the same can besent to the Magistrate concerned as well as to the Authorised Officer concerned as mentioned inSection 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act and thereafter the Authorised Officer concerned may file thecomplaint before the learned Magistrate along with the report submitted by the investigating officerconcerned and thereafter it will be open for the learned Magistrate to take cognizance after followingdue procedure, issue process/summons in respect of the violations of the various provisions of theM.M.D.R. Act and the Rules made thereunder and at that stage, it can be said that cognizance hasbeen taken by the learned Magistrate.Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/921.5. In a case where the violator is permitted to compound the offences on payment of penalty asper sub-section (1) of Section 23-A, considering sub-section (2) of Section 23-A of the M.M.D.R. Act,there shall not be any proceedings or further proceedings against the offender in respect of theoffences punishable under the M.M.D.R. Act or any Rules made thereunder so compounded.However, the bar under sub-section (2) of section 23-A shall not affect any proceedings for theoffences under // 21 // I.P.C., such as, Sections 379 and 414 I.P.C. and the same shall be proceededwith further.22. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the appeals filed by the violators/privateappellants are partly allowed, to the extent quashing the proceedings for the offences under theM.M.D.R. Act-Sections 4/21 of the M.M.D.R. Act only."Both the decisions i.e. Kanwar Pal Singh (supra) and Jayant and others (supra) were considered by athree Judge Bench decision in the case of Pradeep S. Wodeyar (supra). In that case, the dismissalorder passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka in the two petitionsinstituted by the two appellants to quash the criminal proceeding initiated against them for offences,inter alia, under sections 21 and 23 read with sections 4(1) and 4(1-A) of the M.M.D.R. Act wasunder challenge. The following contentions were raised by the learned counsel for the appellants inthat case-(i) The order of the Special Judge taking cognizance is contrary to law. Cognizance, itis well settled, has to be taken of the offences and not of the offender. Yet the SpecialJudge has acted illegally, without application of mind in taking cognizance of theAccused;// 22 //(ii) A-1 (Pradeep S. Wodeyar) cannot be held vicariously liable since:(a) He was not in-charge of the affairs of the company at the relevant time during theallegedly illegal transactions;(b) He was in Indonesia and hence cannot be held personally responsible;(iii) The Special Court constituted Under Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act hasjurisdiction only to try offences for contravention of section (4)(1) or section 4(1-A) ofthe M.M.D.R. Act, punishable under section 21(1). This power of the Special Courtdoes not extend to taking cognizance (and conducting trial) of offences punishableunder the Indian Penal Code;(iv) Section 193 Code of Criminal Procedure bars the Court of Session from taking cognizance of anyoffence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by the Magistrateunder the Code. The only exception is if it has been otherwise expressly provided by the Code ofCriminal Procedure or by any other law for the time being in force. There is no specific provision inPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/10the M.M.D.R. Act or the Code empowering the Court of Session to take cognizance without an orderof committal by the Magistrate; and // 23 //(v) Section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act stipulates that no Court shall take cognizance of any offencepunishable under the Act or any Rules made under it except upon a written complaint made by aperson authorized in this behalf by the Central Government or the State Government. There was noauthorization for the Inspector of the Lokayukta Police and hence there has been a violation of theprovisions of Section 22.The Hon'ble Supreme Court analyzing the contentions raised by the respective parties held asfollows:-"34. Section 193 Code of Criminal Procedure states that the Sessions Court shall nottake cognizance of an offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the Magistratecommits the case to it. The only exception is if it is expressly provided otherwise bythe Code or the statute.Neither the Code nor the M.M.D.R. Act provide that the Special Court could directly take cognizanceof the offences. Therefore, the Sessions Court did not have the authority to take cognizance. Section209 Code of Criminal Procedure provides the Magistrate the power to commit the case. In DharamPal -Vrs.- State of Haryana : (2014) 3 SCC 306, a Constitution Bench while discussing whether thecommitting Court was required under section // 24 // 209 to take cognizance of the offence beforecommitting the case to the Court of Session, held that the Magistrate could either commit the casebefore or after taking cognizance. In this case, the Special Court has directly taken cognizance. Itnow needs to be determined if this irregularity in the cognizance order vitiates the entireproceedings for the order to be quashed and set aside.xxx xxx xxx44. It needs to be determined if condoning the irregularity of the cognizance order under Section465 would lead to a 'failure of justice'. In our considered opinion, it would not lead to a failure ofjustice for the following reasons:      xxx                        xxx                   xxx(iii) Objective     of     the     M.M.D.R.       Act:       Theappellants are accused of the commission of offences under the M.M.D.R. Act involving the exportand transportation of minerals without permit. Offences under the M.M.D.R. Act are environmentalcrimes. These crimes impact upon society at large. These offences cause a detriment to and affectthe well-being of the entire community. Environmental crime is not confined within geographical orState limits. The impact of environmental crime transcends borders and time. Environmental crimemay or may not have an immediately identifiable human // 25 // victim but there can be nomistaking its consequence for the entire bio-system of which human beings are an intrinsic, but notthe only element. Environmental crime is in essence a planetary crime, it affects every component ofPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/11the natural systems with which the planet has been endowed. They constitute our heritage; aheritage which is held in trust by the present for the future. Illegal mining denudes the eco- systemof valuable resources. The destruction of the natural environment has serious consequences for thepresent and the future. The M.M.D.R. Act must hence be construed in this perspective. At one level,illegal mining deprives the State of its revenues. But the law is not merely a revenue yielding orregulating measure. The essence of the law is to protect human kind and every species whoseexistence depends on natural resources from the destruction which is caused by rapacious andunregulated mining. The offences which have been taken into account by Parliament while enactingsub-sections (1) and (1-A) of Section 4 intrinsically affect the environment which, in turn, affects theexistence of communities who depend on the environment and of every species to whom it providesnurture and sustenance. It is because of the wide-ranging impact of such offences on the life of thecommunity and on the well-being of not only the present, but of the // 26 // succeeding generations,that principles such as the precautionary principle, the public trust doctrine and the concept ofsustainable development have gained a sure jurisprudential foundation. In environmental crime,there may be no single, immediate victim. The act which predicates the offence is a crime againsthumanity. These crimes might not be perceived in the present to have immediate, foreseeable orquantifiable repercussions but there is no mistaking that they impact the life of future generations;(iv) The Preamble of the Act at the time of its enactment indicated that it is an "Act for regulation ofmines and the development of minerals". This was substituted by Act 38 of 1999 to emphasise thatthe "Act provides for the development and regulation of mines and minerals". The amendment tothe Preamble is indicative of the intent of the legislature that development and regulation mustproceed hand- in-hand, and in order to reduce the increasing magnitude of environmental crime,development needs to be regulated and sustainable. Thus, when Parliament amended the M.M.D.R.Act to include Section 30-B in 2015 for the constitution of Special Courts which would be deemed tobe Courts of Session conferred with all requisite powers, the object and purpose of the legislative //27 // provision must be borne in mind. The ultimate object of the provision is to ensure thatviolators are punished by a speedy process of trial before a Court duly constituted in that behalf.xxx xxx xxx54. The Appellant had raised a contention that even if the Special Judge had the power to takecognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the M.M.D.R. Actand could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions ofIndian Penal Code. For this purpose, the counsel for the appellant referred to Section 30-B(1) of theM.M.D.R. Act which states that the State Government may for providing speedy trial of offencesunder Section 4(1) or Section 4(1-A) of the M.M.D.R. Act constitute Special Courts.xxx xxx xxx56. In the case before us, the Special Judge took cognizance and issued summons against theappellants for offences under Sections 409, 420 read with Section 120B I.P.C.; Sections 21 and 23read with Sections 4(1), 4(1-A) of the M.M.D.R. Act; and Rule 165 read with Rule 144 of theKarnataka Forest Rules, 1969. According to the First Schedule of the Cr.P.C., the offences underPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/12Sections 409 and 420 are triable by the Magistrate of the First Class. Section 209 Cr.P.C.// 28 // states that if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Courtof Session, then he shall commit the case to the Court of Session. Section 2(hc) of the M.M.D.R. Actstates that a Special Court constituted under Section 30-B(1) of the Act is deemed to be the Court ofSession. A Special Court designated under the M.M.D.R. Act is a Court of Session which isexclusively vested with the power to try offences under the Act. While the offences under Sections409 and 420 I.P.C. are triable by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, the issue is whether theoffences under the I.P.C. can be tried jointly with the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act by the SpecialCourt.        xxx                     xxx                 xxx60.     Therefore,   on     a    combined        reading    ofSections 4 and 5 of Cr.P.C. along with Section 30-C of the M.M.D.R. Act, it is apparent that theprocedure prescribed under the Code shall be applicable to proceedings before the Special Courtunless the M.M.D.R. Act provides anything to the contrary. These provisions incorporate theprinciple of express repeal i.e., unless any provision of the Cr.P.C. is expressly repealed by theprovisions of the M.M.D.R. Act, the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. would apply to theproceedings before the Special Court. Provisions of the PC Act, POCSO Act and // 29 // NIA Actwhich expressly provide that the Special Court may try offences under the statute along with otheroffences is only clarificatory. It is settled law that while contextually interpreting a provision,reference to other statutes which are pari materia can be made [Harshad Mehta v. State ofMaharashtra, (2010) 8 SCC 257]. However, since the provisions in the similar statute on combinedtrial are only clarificatory, the reference to external aids offers no support to the argument of theappellant.xxx xxx xxx62. Since there is no express provision that excludes the application of section 220 Code of CriminalProcedure, it needs to be examined if the M.M.D.R. Act has by necessary implication excluded theapplication of section 220 Code of Criminal Procedure. In this context, it needs to be determined ifsection 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act while establishing the Special Court for offences under section 4 ofthe M.M.D.R. Act, by necessary implication excludes the application of section 220 Code of CriminalProcedure.xxx xxx xxx66. Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act provides for the constitution of the Special Court for 'speedytrial of offences for contravention of the provisions' of Section 4 of the Act. Does the fact that theSpecial Court has jurisdiction to try // 30 // offences under the M.M.D.R. Act oust the jurisdictionof the Special Court to try offences under any other law (in this case the I.P.C.). As has been notedabove, the provisions of the Code may be held to be impliedly repealed, only if there is a 'directconflict' between the provisions such that it is not possible to harmoniously interpret the provisions.Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/13It thus needs to be analysed whether Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act and Section 220 Cr.P.C. canbe harmoniously construed.67. The Judicial Magistrate First Class is invested with the authority to try offences under Sections409 and 420 I.P.C. On the other hand, the Sessions Judge is appointed as a Special Judge for thepurposes of the M.M.D.R. Act. If the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act and the I.P.C. are triedtogether by the Special Judge, there arises no anomaly, for it is not a case where a Judge placedlower in the hierarchy has been artificially vested with the power to try the offences under both theM.M.D.R. Act and the Code. Additionally, if the offences are tried separately by different fora thoughthey arise out of the same transaction, there would be a multiplicity of proceedings and wastage ofjudicial time, and may result in contradictory judgments. It is a settled principle of law that aconstruction that permits hardship, // 31 // inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly mustbe avoided. Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act and Section 220 Cr.P.C. can be harmoniouslyconstrued and such a construction furthers justice. Therefore, Section 30-B cannot be held toimpliedly repeal the application of Section 220 Cr.P.C. to the proceedings before the Special Court.xxx xxx xxx75. The Special Judge, it must be noted, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted undersection 173 Cr.P.C. and not on the basis of a private complaint. Therefore, the case is squarelycovered by the decision in Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta (supra). The Special Judge took note of theF.I.R., the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence. Inthis backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that itdoes not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that anapplication of mind. In the facts of this case, therefore, the order taking cognizance is not erroneous.76. Section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act stipulates that no Court shall take cognizance of any offencepunishable under this Act or Rules, except upon a complaint made in writing by a // 32 // personauthorised on that behalf by the Central or the State Government. It has been contended by theAppellant that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, nocomplaint was filed by the authorised person.77. In State (NCT of Delhi) -Vrs.- Sanjay : (2014) 59 OCR (SC) 522, the principal question which wasformulated for the decision of a two-Judge Bench was whether the Magistrate has the power to takecognizance of the offence upon a police report without a complaint from the authorised personunder Section 22 of the M.M.D.R. Act. Justice M.Y. Eqbal, delivering the judgment for the two-Judge Bench, held that Section 22 only bars the prosecution and cognizance of offences forcontravention of Section 4 of the M.M.D.R. Act without a written complaint and not for offencesunder the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The Court also noted the object and policyunderlying the M.M.D.R. Act in the context of environmental protection. The Court observed:62. Sub-section (1-A) of Section 4 of the M.M.D.R. Act puts a restriction intransporting and storing any mineral otherwise than in accordance with theprovisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder. In other words, no person willPrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/14do mining activity without a valid lease or licence. Section 21 is a penal provisionaccording to which if a person // 33 // contravenes the provisions of sub-section(1-A) of Section 4, he shall be prosecuted and punished in the manner and procedureprovided in the Act. Sub-section (6) has been inserted in Section 4 by amendment making the offence cognizablenotwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Section 22 of the Actputs a restriction on the Court to take cognizance of any offence punishable under the Act or anyRule made thereunder except upon a complaint made by a person authorised in this behalf. It is veryimportant to note that Section 21 does not begin with a non-obstante clause. Instead of the words "notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the timebeing in force no court shall take cognizance....", the Section begins with the words "no Court shalltake cognizance of any offence."xxx xxx xxx70. There cannot be any dispute with regard to restrictions imposed under the M.M.D.R. Act andremedy provided therein. In any case, where there is a mining activity by any person incontravention of the provisions of Section 4 and other sections of the Act, the officer empoweredand authorised under the Act shall exercise all the powers including making a complaint before theJurisdictional Magistrate. It is also not in dispute that the Magistrate shall in such cases takecognizance on the basis of the complaint filed before it by a duly // 34 // authorised officer. In caseof breach and violation of Section 4 and other provisions of the Act, the police officer cannot insistthe Magistrate for taking cognizance under the Act on the basis of the record submitted by the policealleging contravention of the said Act. In other words, the prohibition contained in Section 22 of theAct against prosecution of a person except on a complaint made by the officer is attracted only whensuch person is sought to be prosecuted for contravention of Section 4 of the Act and not for any actor omission which constitutes an offence under the Penal Code.In view of the above discussion, the Court held:(i) The ingredients constituting an offence under the M.M.D.R. Act and theingredients of the offences under the Indian Penal Code are distinct; and(ii) For the commission of an offence under the Indian Penal Code, on receipt of apolice report, the Magistrate having jurisdiction can take cognizance withoutawaiting a complaint by the authorized officer. A complaint is required in terms ofSection 22 only for taking cognizance in respect of a violation of the provisions of theM.M.D.R. Act.             xxx                xxx           xxx85.     In   view   of   the     discussion   above,    wesummarize our findings below:Prasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/15                   // 35 //(i) The Special Court does not have, in the absence of a specific provision to thateffect, the power to take cognizance of an offence under the M.M.D.R. Act without thecase being committed to it by the Magistrate under Section 209 Cr.P.C. The order ofthe Special Judge dated 30 December 2015 taking cognizance is therefore irregular;xxx xxx xxx(vi) The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under M.M.D.R.Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible under Section 220Cr.P.C. There is no express provision in the M.M.D.R. Act which indicates thatSection 220 Cr.P.C. does not apply to proceedings under the M.M.D.R. Act;(vii) Section 30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act does not impliedly repeal Section 220 Cr.P.C. Both theprovisions can be read harmoniously and such an interpretation furthers justice and preventshardship since it prevents a multiplicity of proceedings;(viii) Since cognizance was taken by the Special Judge based on a police report and not a privatecomplaint, it is not obligatory for the Special Judge to issue a fully reasoned order if it otherwiseappears that the Special Judge has applied his mind to the material."// 36 //6. Adverting to the contentions raised by the learned Advocate General and in view of the aforesaidrecent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pradeep S. Wodeyar (supra), since theSpecial Court has got the power to take cognizance of the offences under the M.M.D.R. Act alongwith the connected offences under Indian Penal Code on the basis of a report submitted by policeunder section 173 of Cr.P.C. and to conduct joint trial of all such offences if permissible undersection 220 of Cr.P.C., taking into account the purpose of amendment made in the M.M.D.R. Act inthe year 2015, particularly making stronger provision for checking illegal mining and further factthat the penal provision has been made more stringent by prescribing higher penalties up to rupeesfive lakh per hectare and imprisonment up to five years and taking into the importance of mines inthe State of Odisha, the revenue generated from it, the increasing numbers of crimes reported underthe M.M.D.R. Act particularly in some districts like Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh and Keonjhar as perthe list submitted by the learned Advocate General, so also in some other districts as reported by thelearned District Judges and the positive statement made by the learned Advocate General that theState Government is not against constitution of Special Courts under // 37 // section 30-B of thePrasannajit Nayak vs State Of Odisha on 21 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124632821/16M.M.D.R. Act and since the power of the State Government to establish such Courts for providingspeedy trial of the offences is coupled with duty, this Court expects the State Government to takenecessary effective steps in that regard at an earliest in consonance with the provision under section30-B of the M.M.D.R. Act for constitution of Special Courts for speedy trial of offences forcontravention of the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A) of section 4 of the M.M.D.R.Act so also the other connected offences as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case ofPradeep S. Wodeyar (supra).7. Coming to the anticipatory bail application of the petitioner, Mr. Arupananda Das, the learnedAddl. Govt.Advocate produced the written instruction from the Inspector in-charge of Jakhapura police station and submitted that the petitioner has got as many as sevencriminal antecedents apart from the case in hand. The list furnished by the learned counsel for theState indicates that out of those seven cases, two cases are of the year 2015, one case is of the year2016, two cases are of the year 2018 and also two cases are of the year 2020.In view of the criminal proclivity of the petitioner and the nature of accusation against thepetitioner, I am not inclined // 38 // to grant anticipatory bail to him. Accordingly, the anticipatorybail application stands rejected. The interim protection order dated 09.02.2022 which was extendedfurther on 15.02.2022 stands vacated.8. Before parting, I feel it appropriate to express my unreserved and deep appreciation for thelearned Advocate General as he immediately agreed to argue the matter and rendered amplevaluable assistance by doing very laborious work and showed all fairness during his enlightenedargument which helped in arriving at a just decision.A free copy of the order be handed over to the learned Advocate General for compliance.Issue urgent certified copy as per Rules................................S.K.
