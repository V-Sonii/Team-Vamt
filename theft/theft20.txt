MUKESH SHARMA, ADVOCATE FOR R-2 )    Whether approved for reporting?    This petition coming on for orders this day, the Court passed the following:                         O R D E RBy way of instant petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, prayer hasbeen made on behalf of the petitioner for quashing of FIR No. 21 of 2019, dated 7.5.2019 underSections 448 and 453 of IPC, registered at police Station, Sunni, .District Shimla, Himachal Pradesh as well as consequent proceedings pending adjudication in theCourt of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Court No.4, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, on the basisof the compromise arrived inter se parties (Annexure P-2).2. Precisely, the facts of the case as emerge from the record are that FIR sought to be quashed in theinstant proceedings, came to be lodged at the behest of respondent No.2 i.e. The Juni Co-operative Multipurpose Society Limited, Tehsil Sunni, District Shimla, H.P., through its SecretarySh. Puran Chand Verma, who alleged that petitioner besides making an attempt to take forciblepossession of one shop of the society, also stolen 20 bags of cement and 100 bricks lying in the shop.After completion of the investigation, police presented the challan in the competent court of law, butbefore same could be taken to its logical end, parties have entered into the compromise, wherebyboth the parties have resolved to settle their dispute amicably interse them. As per the settlementarrived interse parties, respondent No.2-Society has inducted the petitioner as a tenant on the termsand conditions contained in the agreement and as such, respondent No.2-Society does not wish toprosecute the case further .Vikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/23. Vide order dated 14.01.2022, this Court while issuing notice to the respondents deemed itnecessary to cause presence of the parties in the court, especially respondents No.2, so that factumwith regard to correctness and genuineness of the compromise .placed on record could be ascertained. Besides above, this Court also directed learned AdditionalAdvocate General to verify the aforesaid factum of compromise, if any, arrived interse parties.4. Though, respondent- State has not filed status report/ reply till date, but Sh. Puran Chand Verma,Secretary of respondent No.2- Society has come present in person pursuant to order dated14.01.2022 and is being represented by Sh. Mukesh Sharma, Advocate. He states on oath before thisCourt that he on the basis of authorization given to him by the Society has come to this Court torecord his statement. He states that after lodging of the FIR sought to be quashed in the instantproceedings, petitioner has entered into the compromise with respondent No.2-Society, wherebyrespondent No.2-Society has inducted him as a tenant in the shop in question on the terms andconditions contained in the agreement. He states that since petitioner has agreed to abide by theterms and conditions of the agreement and he has been inducted as tenant in the shop in question,respondent No.-2 Society does not wish to prosecute the case further lodged at its behest and assuch, shall have no objection in case prayer made instant petition is allowed. While admitting thecontents of the compromise placed on record to be correct, he also admits his signature. Hisstatement is taken on record.5. Mr. Sudhir Bhatnagar, learned Additional Advocate General after having heard the aforesaidstatement made by .respondent No.2 fairly states that no fruitful purpose would be served in case FIR as well asconsequent proceedings sought to be quashed are allowed to sustain. He further states thatotherwise also, chances of conviction of petitioner- accused is very remote and bleak in view of thestatement made by respondent No.2 before this Court and as such, respondent-State shall have noobjection in case the prayer made in the petitions is allowed.6. This Court, after having carefully perused the compromise, which has been duly effected betweenthe parties, sees substantial force in the prayer having been made by the learned counsel for thepetitioners that offences in the instant case can be ordered to be compounded.7. Since the petition has been filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C, this Court deems it fit to consider thepresent petition in the light of the judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Narinder Singh andothers versus State of Punjab and another (2014)6 Supreme Court Cases 466, whereby Hon'ble ApexCourt has formulated guidelines for accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings orrefusing to accept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings. Perusalof judgment referred above clearly depicts that in para 29.1, Hon'ble Apex Court has returned thefindings that power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the powerwhich lies in the Court to compound the offences under section 320 of the Code. No doubt, undersection 482 of the .Vikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/3Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those caseswhich are not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between themselves.However, this power is to be as under:-29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down the followingprinciples by which the High Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment tothe settlement between the parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of theCode while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing toaccept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings:29.1Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from thepower which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of theCode. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent powerto quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable,where the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power isto be exercised sparingly and with caution.29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition forquashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would beto secure:(i) ends of justice, or(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.While exercising the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C the High Court is to form anopinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.29.3. Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinousand serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.Similarly, for offences alleged to have been committed under special statute like thePrevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by Public Servants whileworking in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromisebetween the victim and the offender..29.4. On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominantlycivil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arisingout of matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed when theparties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves.Vikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/429.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether thepossibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases wouldput the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would becaused to him by not quashing the criminal cases.29.6. Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category of heinous andserious offences and therefore is to be generally treated as crime against the societyand not against the individual alone. However, the High Court would not rest itsdecision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or thecharge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examineas to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or theprosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to provingthe charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the HighCourt to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on thevital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical report inrespect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor. On thebasis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether there is astrong possibility of conviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. Inthe former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the criminalproceedings whereas in the later case it would be permissible for the High Court toaccept the plea compounding the offence based on complete settlement between theparties. At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlementbetween the parties is going to result in harmony between them which may improvetheir future relationship.29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code ornot, timings of settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement isarrived at immediately after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is stillunder investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement toquash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of the reason that at thisstage the investigation is still on and .even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge isframed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy stage, theHigh Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after primafacie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand,where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of theevidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally the High Court shouldrefrain from exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases thetrial court would be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to come aconclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not.Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial courtand the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromisebetween the parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal ofVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/5the offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is provedunder Section 307 IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and,therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime".8. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case Gian Singh v.State of Punjab and anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303 has heldthat power of the High Court in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint inexercise of its inherent power is distinct and different from the power of a Criminal Court forcompounding offences under Section 320 Cr.PC. Even in the judgment passed in Narinder Singh'scase, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that while exercising inherent power under Section 482 Cr.PCthe Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime and its social impact and itcautioned the Courts not to exercise the power for quashing proceedings in heinous and seriousoffences of mental depravity, murder, rape, dacoity etc. However subsequently, the Hon'ble ApexCourt in Dimpey Gujral and Ors. vs. Union Territory through Administrator, UT, .Chandigarh and Ors. (2013( 11 SCC 497 has also held as under:-"7. In certain decisions of this Court in view of the settlement arrived at by theparties, this Court quashed the FIRs though some of the offences were non-compoundable. A two Judges' Bench of this court doubted the correctness of thosedecisions. Learned Judges felt that in those decisions, this court had permittedcompounding of non-compoundable offences. The said issue was, therefore, referredto a larger bench.The larger Bench in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303 considered therelevant provisions of the Code and the judgments of this court and concluded asunder: (SCC pp. 342-43, para 61)61. The position that emerges from the above r discussion can be summarised thus:the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaintin exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given toa criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to beexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure theends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what casespower to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercisedwhere the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the factsand circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, beforeexercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature andgravity of the crime. Heinous and se serious impact on society. Similarly, anycompromise between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under specialstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by publicservants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashingcriminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases havingVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/6overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for thepurposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out ofmatrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basicallyprivate or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. Inthis category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, .because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility ofconviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accusedto great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him bynot quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromisewith the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would beunfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceedingor continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process oflaw despite settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer andwhether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal r case is put to anend and if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shallbe well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding." (emphasis supplied)8. In the light of the above observations of this court in Gian Singh, we feel that this isa case where the continuation of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse ofprocess of law because the alleged offences are not heinous offences showing extremedepravity nor are they against the society. They are offences of a personal nature andburying them would bring about peace and amity between the two sides. In thecircumstances of the case, FIR No. 163 dated 26.10.2006 registered under Section147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 452 and 506 of the IPC at Police Station Sector 3, Chandigarhand all consequential proceedings arising there from including the final reportpresented under Section 173 of the Code and charges framed by the trial Court arehereby quashed."9. Recently Hon'ble Apex Court in its latest judgment dated 4th October, 2017, titled as ParbatbhaiAahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others versus State of Gujarat and Another, passedin Criminal Appeal No.1723 of 2017 arising out of SLP(Crl) No.9549 of 2016, reiterated theprinciples/ parameters laid down in Narinder Singh's case supra for accepting the settlement andquashing the proceedings. It would be profitable to reproduce para No. 13 to 15 of the judgmentherein:."13. The same principle was followed in Central Bureau of Investigation v. ManinderSingh (2016)1 SCC 389 by a bench of two learned Judges of this Court. In that case,the High Court had, in the exercise of its inherent power under Section 482 quashedproceedings under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 read with Section 120-B of thePenal Code. While allowing the appeal filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation MrVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/7Justice Dipak Misra (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that the caseinvolved allegations of forgery of documents to embezzle the funds of the bank. Insuch a situation, the fact that the dispute had been settled with the bank would notjustify a recourse to the power under Section 482:"...In economic offences Court must not only keep in view that money has been paidto the bank which has r been defrauded but also the society at large. It is not a case ofsimple assault or a theft of a trivial amount; but the offence with which we areconcerned is well planned and was committed with a deliberate design with an eye ofpersonal profit regardless of consequence to the society at large. To quash theproceeding merely on the ground that the accused has settled the amount with thebank would be a misplaced sympathy. If the prosecution against the economicoffenders are not allowed to continue, the entire community is aggrieved."14. In a subsequent decision in State of Tamil Nadu v R Vasanthi Stanley (2016) 1SCC 376, the court rejected the submission that the first respondent was a woman"who was following the command of her husband" and had signed certain documentswithout being aware of the nature of the fraud which was being perpetrated on thebank. Rejecting the submission, this Court held that:"... Lack of awareness, knowledge or intent is neither to be considered nor accepted ineconomic offences. The submission assiduously presented on gender leaves usunimpressed. An offence under the criminal law is an offence and it does not dependupon the gender of an accused. True it is, there are certain provisions in Code ofCriminal Procedure relating to exercise of jurisdiction Under Section 437, etc. thereinbut that altogether pertains to a different sphere. A person committing a murder orgetting involved in a financial scam or forgery of documents, cannot claim dischargeor acquittal on the ground of her gender as that is neither constitutionally norstatutorily a valid argument. The offence is gender neutral in this case. We say nomore .on this score...""...A grave criminal offence or serious economic offence or for that matter the offencethat has the potentiality to create a dent in the financial health of the institutions, isnot to be quashed on the ground that there is delay in trial or the principle that whenthe matter has been settled it should be quashed to avoid the load on the system..."15.The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject may besummarized in the following propositions:(i) Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High r Court to prevent an abuseof the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does notconfer new powers. It only recognizes and preserves powers which inhere in the HighVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/8Court;(ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First InformationReport or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived atbetween the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdictionfor the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, thepower of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even ifthe offence is non-compoundable.(iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should bequashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court mustevaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;(iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it hasto be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of theprocess of any court;(v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should bequashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolvesultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaborationof principles can be formulated;(vi) In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea thatthe dispute has bee inherent n settled, the High Court must have due regard to thenature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mentaldepravity or offences such as .murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or thefamily of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, notprivate in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continuewith the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest inpunishing persons for serious offences;(vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which havean overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinctfooting in so far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;(viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial,mercantile, partnership or r similar transac mental tions with an essentially civilflavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled thedispute;Vikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/9(ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view ofthe compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote andthe continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and(x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions (viii) and (ix)above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of thestate have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute betweenprivate disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where theoffender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud ormisdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial oreconomic system will weigh in the balance.10. The Hon'ble Apex Court in (2019) 5 SCC 688, titled as State of Madhya Pradesh vs. LaxmiNarayan , has held as under:-" 15 . Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of this Court on thepoint, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and held as under:15.1 That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminalproceedings for the non- compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code canbe exercised having overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character,particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out ofmatrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties have resolved theentire dispute amongst .themselves;15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involved heinousand serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society;15.3 Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences under the specialstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by publicservants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis ofcompromise between the victim and the offender;15.4 Offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act etc. rwould fall in the categoryof heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be treated as crime against thesociety and not against the individual alone, and therefore, the criminal proceedingsfor the offence under Section 307 IPC and/or the Arms Act etc. which have a seriousimpact on the society cannot be quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 ofthe Code, on the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongstthemselves. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely becausethere is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under thisVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/10provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporationof Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficientevidence, which if proved, would lead to framing the charge under Section 307 IPC.For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injurysustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body,nature of weapons used etc. However, such an exercise by the High Court would bepermissible only after the evidence is collected after investigation and the chargesheet is filed/charge is framed and/or during the trial. Such exercise is notpermissible when the matter is still under investigation. Therefore, the ultimateconclusion in paragraphs 29.6 and 29.7 of the decision of this Court in the case ofNarinder Singh (supra) should be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole andin the circumstances stated hereinabove;15.5 While exercising the power under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminalproceedings in respect of non-compoundable offences, which are private in nature and do not have a serious imparton society, on the ground that there is a settlement/ compromise between the victimand the offender, the High Court is required to consider the antecedents of theaccused; the conduct of .the accused, namely, whether the accused was absconding and why he wasabsconding, how he had managed with the complainant to enter into a compromiseetc.11. It is quite apparent from the aforesaid exposition of law that High Court hasinherent power to quash criminal proceedings even in those cases which are notcompoundable, but such power is to be exercised sparingly and with great caution. Inthe judgments, referred hereinabove, Hon'ble Apex Court has categorically held thatCourt while exercising inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. must have dueregard to the nature and gravity of offence sought to be compounded. Hon'ble ApexCourt has though held that heinous and serious offences of mental depravity, murder,rape, dacoity etc. cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family ofthe victim have settled the dispute, but it has also observed that while exercising itspowers, High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is remoteand bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to greatoppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by notquashing the criminal cases. Hon'ble Apex Court has further held that Court whileexercising power under Section 482 Cr.P.C can also be swayed by the fact thatsettlement between the parties is going to result in harmony between them whichmay improve their future relationship. Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment renderedin State of Tamil Nadu supra, has reiterated that Section 482 preserves the .Vikrant Sharma Son Of Sh. Het vs State Of Punjab And Another ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45801520/11inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure theends of justice and has held that the power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if theoffence is non-compoundable. In the aforesaid judgment Hon'ble Apex Court has held that whileforming an opinion whether a criminal proceedings or complaint should be quashed in exercise ofits jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice wouldjustify the exercise of the inherent power.12. In the case at hand also, offences alleged to have been committed by the petitioner do not involveoffences of moral turpitude or any grave/heinous crime, rather same are petty offences, as such, thisCourt deems it appropriate to quash the FIR as well as consequential proceedings thereto, especiallykeeping in view the fact that the petitioner and respondent No.2/complainant have compromisedthe matter interse them, in which case, possibility of conviction is remote and no fruitful purposewould be served in continuing with the criminal proceedings.13. Since the matter stands compromised between the parties and respondent No.2/complainant isno more interested in pursuing the criminal proceedings against the petitioner, no fruitful purposewould be served in case proceedings initiated at the behest of respondent No.2/complainant areallowed to continue, as such, prayer made in the petition at hand can be accepted..14. Consequently, in view of the averments contained in the petition as well as the submissionshaving been made by the learned counsel for the parties that the matter has been compromised, andkeeping in mind the well settled proposition of law as well as the compromise being genuine, thisCourt has no inhibition in accepting the compromise and quashing the FIR as well as consequentproceedings pending in the competent Court of law.15. Accordingly, in view of the detailed discussion made hereinabove as well as law laid down by theHon'ble Apex Court, FIR No. 21 of 2019, dated 7.5.2019 under Sections 448 and 453 of IPC,registered at police Station, Sunni, District Shimla, Himachal Pradesh as well as consequentproceedings pending adjudication in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Court No.4,Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, are quashed and set-aside. The petitioner-accused is acquitted of thecharges framed against him.16. The present petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms.Pending application(s), if any, also stands disposed of.    22nd February,2022                                        (Sandeep Sharma),          (shankar)                                               JudgeVikrant Sharma Son Of Sh.
