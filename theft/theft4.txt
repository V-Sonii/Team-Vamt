DW2/Y (colly).DW-1 and DW-2 were duly cross-examined by counsel for complainant. Thereafter, vide jointstatement of accused no.1 and 2 defence evidence was closed.9. Thereafter, matter was listed for final arguments. Final arguments were heard from both thesides. It was argued by the Ld. counsel for the complainant that this is a fit case for conviction of theaccused as all the essential ingredients of Section 138 of the Act read with Section 139 of the Acthave been fulfilled and that the same has been aptly demonstrated by the complainant before thecourt. Ld. Counsel for complainant argued that accused has entered into agreement to sell withcomplainant in respect of the property bearing no. 36A, area measuring 50 (14x32) Sq. yard out ofKhasra no. 8/15, situated in the area of Village Nangloi Jat Delhi -110041, known as Khub RamPark, Gali no.3, station block, Part II, Prem Nagar-I, Delhi-110086, for a consideration ofRs.22,50,000/- and complainant has paid Rs. 4,50,000/- as earnest money in cash to the ImranMalik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 5 of 20 accused persons. It wasfurther argued that accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon being owner of the said property has handedover the copy of ownership deep/property documents to the complainant. It was argued that on18.06.2017, accused persons approached the complainant alongwith Khalil (husband of accused no.1and father of accused no.2) and settled the entire dispute for a sum of Rs. 4,50,000/-. He arguedthat the accused persons with the malafide intention took back the original bayana agreement andissued a cheque for a sum of Rs. 4,50,000/- signed by both the accused persons. He argued that thecheque in question has been dischonoured for the reasons 'funds insufficient'. He argued thatcomplainant has also examined CW-2 Pradeep Kumar, who was an eye witness when cheque inquestion was issued to the complainant by the accused persons. He argued that CW-2 also gave hisstatement to police in investigation of complaint filed by accused for allegedly stealing cheques bycomplainant. He argued that after investigation, concerned police officials gave clean chit to theImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/4complainant as there was no theft of cheques or forgery by the complainant as alleged by theaccused persons.10. He further argued that accused no.1 in her cross-examination made contradictory statement asregard the stand taken by her as DW-1 in her defence evidence. Hakiman Khatoon during hercross-examination stated that she is illiterate and she does not remember as to whether she hadsigned any documents in the last six months. He argued that accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon filedher evidence affidavit in her DE with her signatures. He further argued that accused no.1 did notsign the notice under Section251 Cr.P.C and Statement of accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. tomislead the court. He argued that accused no. 1 in her cross-examination mentioned about twoplastic bags kept on the table on the day, the complainant stole the said cheques. He further arguedthat complainant no.1 did not mention about two plastic bags in her police complaint Ex. DW- 1/1.He argued that there is contradiction in the date of lost/stolen cheques as the same is mentioned inthe online complaint as 10.11.2016 and the date of incident as mentioned by accused no.1 in hercross-examination is 11.11.2016. He further argued that accused also admittedly did not give stoppayment instructions to her bank in regard to stolen cheque in question. He argued that accusedpersons in their reply to the legal demand notice Ex. CW-1/J, nowhere mentioned that accused no.1Hakiman Khatoon used to put her thumb Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No.16834/2017 Page no. 6 of 20 impression in bank account and that signature on the cheque is forgedby the complainant. He argued that even if the version of accused persons regarding theft of chequesis admitted, it is hard to believe as to how the complainant has knowledge about the account beingjoint account in the name of accused no.1 and accused no.2. He further argued that accused personshas filed various complaints to falsely implicate the complainant and create defence in their favourto escape from the liability in the present case. He argued that accused no. 2 Salim Malik did notchoose to lead DE and to rebut the presumption. He further argued that to prove his financialcapacity, complainant has deposed in first paragraph of his complaint that he is a farmer and hasgood financial status. It is averred that accused failed to raise the probable defence to disapprove thecase of complainant and to rebut the presumption under Section139 of the Act. Therefore, accusedbe convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the N. I. Act.11. Per contra, ld. Counsel for accused reiterated the version of accused in answer to the notice underSection 251 Cr.P.C and in the statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C and in defence evidence. Sheargued that there were several discrepancies and inconsistencies in the statement made bycomplainant which casts sufficient doubt on case of the complainant. She argued that accusedpersons have not taken any money from the complainant and there was no transaction of sale ofproperty with the complainant. She argued that the legal notice sent by complainant to accused nowhere mentions about any agreement to sell, byana receipt, cash receipt and it just mentions aboutsome liability/debt. She argued that the averments in the legal notice are not same as those in thecomplaint. She argued that the accused persons have also sent reply to the legal notice which is Ex.CW-1/I whereby they mentioned about the FIR registered at PS Crime Branch, Delhi, dated12.11.2016, regarding the theft of some signed cheques and property papers from their house by thecomplainant. She further argued that even after reading the reply to the legal notice, thecomplainant never approached police. She argued that story of property selling is the after thoughtof the complainant. She argued that no agreement to sell as alleged by complainant is on record. SheImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/5further argued that the copy of the property papers Mark A are the copy of the property papers ofthe accused persons and copy of the bayana receipt Mark B is not signed by accused persons. Shefurther argued that cash receipt Ex. CW-1/A is neither in the handwriting of accused persons norsigned Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 7 of 20 by them.12. She further argued that all the papers are forged and fabricated. She argued that complainanthad friendly relations and visiting terms to the house of the accused and therefore,he has knowledgeabout account being in joint name of both the accused persons. She argued that CW-2 PradeepKuamar was a witness brought about by complainant and he verbatim stated whatever was told tohim by the complainant. She further argued that cheque in question was never signed by accusedno.1 as she used her thumb impression in this account. She argued that accused no.1 is an illiteratelady and used to sign only when her children used to teach her to sign. Thereafter, she use to forgetthe same after sometime. She argued that the signatures of accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon on theproperty papers is different from the alleged signatures on byana receipt, cash receipt and thecheque in question as same are forged by the complainant. He submitted that complainant hasfailed to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt and accused is entitled to be acquitted of offenceunder Section138 of the Act.13. I have perused the entire record as well as evidence led by the complainant as well as by theaccused and given my thoughtful consideration to them.14. Before appreciating the facts of the case in detail for the purpose of decision, let relevant positionof law be discussed first:-For the offence under Section 138 of the Act to be made out against the accused, the complainantmust prove the following points, that:-1. the accused issued a cheque on account maintained by him with a bank.2. the said cheque had been issued in discharge, in whole or in part, of any legal debtor other liability.3. the said cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of three monthsfrom the date of cheque or within the period of its validity.4. the aforesaid cheque, when presented for encashment, was returnedunpaid/dishonoured.5. the payee of the cheque issued a legal notice of demand to the drawer within 30 days from thereceipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of Imran Malik vs. HakimanKhatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 8 of 20 the cheque.6. the drawer of the cheque failed to make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of aforesaidlegal notice of demand.Imran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/615. The Act raises two presumptions in favour of the holder of the cheque i.e. Complainant in thepresent case; firstly, in regard to the passing of consideration as contained in Section 118 (a) andsecondly, a presumption that the holder of cheque receiving the same of the nature referred to inSection 139 discharged in whole or in part any debt or other liability.Section 118 of the N.I Act provides :"Presumptions as to negotiable instruments: Until the contrary is proved, the followingpresumptions shall be made: (a) of consideration - that every negotiable instrument was made ordrawn for consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed,negotiated or transferred was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration;"Section 139 of the N.I Act further provides as follows:"Presumption in favour of holder - it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that theholder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, inwhole or in part, of any debt or other liability".16. For the offence under Section 138 of the Act, the presumptions under Sections 118(a) and 139have to be compulsory raised as soon as execution of cheque by accused is admitted or proved by thecomplainant and thereafter burden is shifted to accused to prove otherwise. These presumptionsshall be rebutted only when the contrary is proved by the accused, that is, the cheque was not issuedfor consideration and in discharge of any debt or liability etc. A presumption is not in itself evidencebut only makes a prima facie case for a party for whose benefit it exists. Presumptions both underSections 118 and 139 are rebuttable in nature. Same was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Indiain Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee [(2001) 6 SCC 16].17. In the present case, accused no.2 Salim Malik has admitted his signatures on the cheques inquestion, in the notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C and in his statement under Section313 Cr.P.C.Reference can be made to Judgment of Apex Court in Rangappa v. Mohan, AIR 2010 SC 1898, that,Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 9 of 20 "Once the chequerelates to the account of the accused and he accepts and admits the signatures on the said cheque,then initial presumption as contemplated under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act hasto be raised by the Court in favour of the complainant."Also in the case of K. Bhaskaran Vs. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan 1999 (4) RCR (Criminal) 309, it hasbeen held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:"As the signature in the cheque is admitted to be that of the accused, the presumption envisaged inSection 118 of the Act can legally be inferred that the cheque was made or drawn for considerationon the date which the cheque bears. Section 139 of the Act enjoins on the court to presume that theholder of the cheque received it for the discharge of any debt or liability."Imran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/7It has been held in M/s. Kumar Exports v. M/s. Sharma Carpets, [2009 A.I.R. (SC) 1518] that theaccused may rebut these presumptions by leading direct evidence and in some and exceptionalcases, from the case set out by the complainant, that is, the averments in the complaint, the case setout in the statutory notice and evidence adduced by the complainant during the trial. Further, theburden may be discharged by the accused by showing preponderance of probabilities and the onuson the accused is not as heavy as it is on the complainant to prove his case. In light of aforestatedlegal position, let us carry out a scrutiny of the evidence led at the trial.18. The defence taken by accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon right from the stage of notice u/s 251 Cr.P.C and through out trial is that the cheque in question is not signed by her and that she uses herthumb impression in the said account. In support of her defence, accused produced bank witnessDW-2 Sh. Wazir Singh attended from Syndicate Bank, Nangloi, Najafgarh Road-1, New Delhi whobrought his authorization letter Ex. DW-2/A and account opening form of 1988 of HakimanKhatoon Ex. DW-2/B (colly) and it was submitted by the bank witness that the accused no.1 had notsigned on the account opening form and it only bears her name at point B and point C which waswritten by the person who had filled the account opening form. It was further submitted that thesaid account was opened in the year 1988 and Salim Malik was made joint holder of the accusedlater on and the cheque in question Ex. CW-1/B also pertains to the said account. He was dulycross-examined by the counsel for the complainant whereby he was asked as to why the Imran Malikvs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 10 of 20 cheque in question isdishonoured with the reason 'funds insufficient' and not by the reason 'drawer signatures differs'. Tothis witness responded that he cannot say as to why the cheque has been dishonoured for reasons offunds insufficient. DW-2 Wazir Singh was again recalled as defence witness on the application filedon behalf of accused and also on application under Section 311 Cr. P. C filed on behalf ofcomplainant. The witness brought the copy of bank statement of accused no. 1 for the period from01.01.2015 to 11.10.2021, certified copy of account image display for the accused exhibited DW-2/Y(colly ) and copy of fire details report dated 25.03.2021 and copy of NCR dated 28.03.2021 , PSNangloi Ex. DW-2/X (colly). It was again deposed by witness that accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoonuses her thumb impression at the time of operating her bank account as per bank report and thatshe has opened her bank account by using her thumb impression and not by signing. It was statedby the witness that the cheque book and ATM were issued in the name of Salim Malik. It was furthersubmitted by bank witness when the the cheque is presented in the bank and if the funds areinsufficient in the account then the cheque is returned with the remarks of 'funds insufficient' andother factors like drawer signatures etc are not considered. Other factors are considered only whenthere are funds in the account. It was also submitted that he could not produce the account openingform of Salim Malik with request letter/application of Hakiman Khatoon for adding her son SalimMalik as joint account holder as the same were destroyed in some fire which occurred in the bank on25.03.2021. The court has also gone through the record filed by the witness and found that theaccused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon has used her thumb impression at the time of opening of the saidaccount as seen in the account opening form and the same does not bear her signatures.19. However this defence of accused is not in itself sufficient to dislodge the presumptions under theAct. Firstly, the cheque in question has been dishonored vide return memo dated 28.06.2017 forreason 'Funds Insufficient' (Ex. CW-1/C) and not for any other reason such as signature of accusedImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/8differs from specimen signature.20. Moreover it is a settled proposition of law that merely because the signatures on the cheque inquestion do not match the specimen signatures with the bank, cannot be sole ground for escapingprosecution under Section 138 of the Act. In Laxmi Dyechem vs Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon& Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 11 of 20 State Of Gujarat (2012) 13 SCC 375, the Hon'bleSupreme Court held:"15. ... Just as dishonour of a cheque on the ground that the account has been closedis a dishonour falling in the first contingency referred to in Section 138, so alsodishonour on the ground that the "signatures do not match" or that the "image is notfound", which too implies that the specimen signatures do not match the signatureson the cheque would constitute a dishonour within the meaning of Section 138 of theAct. A similar result can be brought about by the drawer changing his specimensignature given to the bank or in the case of a company by the company changing themandate of those authorised to sign the cheques on its behalf. Such changes oralteration in the mandate may be dishonest or fraudulent and that would inevitablyresult in dishonour of all cheques signed by the previously authorised signatories.There is in our view no qualitative difference between a situation where thedishonour takes place on account of the substitution by a new set of authorisedsignatories resulting in the dishonour of the cheques already issued and anothersituation in which the drawer of the cheque changes his own signatures or closes theaccount or issues instructions to the bank not to make the payment. So long as thechange is brought about with a view to preventing the cheque being honoured thedishonour would become an offence under Section 138 subject to other conditionsprescribed being satisfied.Even in such cases, the question whether or not there was a lawfully recoverable debtor liability for discharge whereof the cheque was issued would be a matter that thetrial Court will examine having regard to the evidence adduced before it and keepingin view the statutory presumption that unless rebutted the cheque is presumed tohave been issued for a valid consideration."In present case also, mere denial of signature on the cheque by the accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoonis not sufficient, in itself, to rebut the statutory presumption and the case has to be considered onmerits.21. In the present case, the complainant by way of an affidavit led his own evidence testifying thecheque was issued to him in discharge towards liability, regarding property bearing no. 36A, areameasuring 50 (14x32) Sq. yard out of Khasra no. 8/15, situated in the area of Village Nangloi JatDelhi -110041, known as Khub Ram Park, Gali no.3, station block, Part II, Prem Nagar-I,Delhi-110086 which was settled for Rs. 4,50,000/- as the same was earlier paid as earnest money bythe complainant to the accused in cash.Imran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/9Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 12 of 20 The dishonour ofthe memo of cheque and legal demand notice were exhibited on record.22. Thus as per the scheme of the Act, on proof of the foundational facts, a presumption arises as tothe cheque having been issued in discharge of a legal liability, and the burden of proof lies upon theaccused to rebut the said presumption. This clearly is an instance of the rule of 'reverse onus' inaction, where it is incumbent on the accused to lead what can be called 'negative evidence'. Evidenceof a character not to prove a fact affirmatively, but to lead evidence to show non existence of liability.Keeping in view, that this is a departure from the cardinal rule of 'presumption of innocence' infavour of the accused, and also keeping in mind that negative evidence is not easy to be led by itsvery nature. It is now fairly well settled that the accused can displace this presumption on a scale ofpreponderance of probabilities and the lack of consideration or a legally enforceable debt need notbe proved to the hilt or beyond all reasonable doubts. The accused can either prove that the liabilitydid not exist or make the non existence of liability so probable that a reasonable person ought underthe circumstances of the case, act on the supposition that it does not exist. Simply put, the accusedhas to make out a fairly plausible hypothesis. It has been held in M/s. Kumar Exports v. M/s.Sharma Carpets, [2009 A.I.R. (SC) 1518] that the accused may rebut these presumptions by leadingdirect evidence and in some and exceptional cases, from the case set out by the complainant, that is,the averments in the complaint, the case set out in the statutory notice and evidence adduced by thecomplainant during the trial. In light of aforestated legal position, let us carry out a scrutiny of theevidence led at the trial.23. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the defence of the accused persons is basicallypremised on two factors. One that the copy of the property papers i.e. Mark A is the copy of theirproperty papers and Mark B, i.e the copy of bayana receipt and Ex.CW-/A i.e the cash receipt areneither in the handwriting of accused no.1 Hakiman Khatoon nor signed by any of the accusedpersons. Second, the cheque in question had been stolen from their house in November 2016 andthey have also lodged an online police complaint for the same.Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 13 of 2024. As far as the first leg of the defence is concerned, the complainant has stated in his complaintand his evidence, that Khalil (husband of accused no.1 and father of accused no.2) and thecomplainant were having friendly relations and visiting terms with each other. That the complainantvisited the accused persons on 21.05.2016 and the accused no. 1 entered into agreement to sell withregard to the property bearing no. 36A, area measuring 50 (14x32) Sq. yard out of Khasra no. 8/15,situated in the area of Village Nangloi Jat Delhi -110041, known as Khub Ram Park, Gali no.3,station block, Part II, Prem Nagar-I, Delhi-110086, being the owner of the said property and handedover the copy of ownership deed/documents pertaining to said property and taken Rs. 4,50,000/- asearnest money from the complainant in cash out of the total consideration price of Rs.22,50,000/-.That it was mutually agreed between the parties to hand over the possession on or before20.07.2016. That in the failure to execute the said sale transaction, the complainant demanded backhis money and matter was settled for Rs. 4,50,000/- and original byana receipt was returned toaccused. The accused had issued the impugned cheque dated 21.06.2017 in discharge of the saidImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/10liability which got dishonoured on presentation. Subsequently, the legal notice was sent to accusedpersons by post. The accused persons did not make payment until the expiry of 15 days from thereceipt of legal notice. Thereafter, the complaint was filed by the complainant.25. The complainant was cross-examined by the accused at large on 18.02.2019. In the examinationin chief of the complainant, the accused sought to challenge the alleged amount of Rs. 4,50,000/-paid as earnest money by the complainant to the accused. In order to prove the transaction ofagreement to sale of property and payment of earnest money, complainant has relied upon copy ofproperty papers of accused i.e Mark A, copy of the byana receipt i.e Mark B and cash receipt Ex.CW-1/A. The accused had put a suggestion to the complainant that the said receipt are not signed byaccused no.1 and same are forged and fabricated documents. The suggestion was denied by thecomplainant.26. Now, as far as the documents Mark A, Mark B, Ex. CW-1/A are concerned, the complainant hasnot put even a single question to accused in regard thereof. It is stated by the complainant that thecopy of byana receipt Mark B and cash receipt Ex. CW-1/A Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & AnrCC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 14 of 20 were filled in by some third person who was present with theaccused persons and he was not known to the the complainant. However, no signature of this personis there on either document and complainant is not even aware about his name.27. The complainant did not state anything as to the sources of his funds in his examination in chieffor payment made to the accused persons. However, only in his cross examination, he disclosed thatentire sources of payment made to accused person was from his savings at his house. He furtherstated that he did not withdraw any amount from his bank to advance the money to the accused. Itwas further stated by the complainant that he cannot produce any documentary proof regardingsaving of Rs. 4,50,000/- at his house.28. The complainant has also examined CW-2 Pradeep Kumar who reiterated the same version asthat of the complainant. CW-2 also did not produce a single document to show execution of anyagreement to sell between the complainant and the accused persons. He said that he did not see thecheque and byana receipts by his own eyes. He did not remember any dates as to when was theagreement executed, when he visited the police station along with the complainant and furthermore,he also did not remember the date on which he mediated between the complainant and accusedpersons. The above testimony of CW-2 does not inspire confidence due to multiple reasons. Firstly,it was not disclosed in the list of witnesses, complaint, evidence affidavit of complainant or evencross-examination of complainant that the cheque in question and byana receipt were exchanged infront of Pradeep Kumar. Summoning said Pradeep Kumar as witness only after conclusion ofcross-examination of complainant gives rise to scope for improvement in version of complainantand also raises serious suspicion on the credibility of the witness. Secondly, the CW-2 is a friend ofcomplainant and per se is interested witness. Thirdly, the CW-2 has not placed on record anycontemporaneous agreement or receipt showing payment of money by the complainant to theaccused. In light of the above, the testimony of CW-2 is considered as self serving and not reliable.Imran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/1129. Moreover, the complainant has nowhere mentioned in the legal notice sent to accused about anyagreement to sell entered into with the accused persons. It was only in Imran Malik vs. HakimanKhatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 15 of 20 the complaint, where the complainant hasmentioned about the agreement to sell, bayana receipt and cash receipt executed by the accusedpersons.30. It is a trite law in cheque dishonour case all that the accused has to do is to present a defence onthe basis of preponderance of probabilities. Once, the initial presumption is rebutted, the onus isupon the complainant to prove his case beyond the reasonable doubt. Once the execution ofdocuments has been denied by the accused, it was incumbent upon the complainant to prove thesame in accordance of the Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act. At this juncture, let us spare aglance upon the said provision. Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act states that :-"if a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written only wholly or in partby any person, the signature or the handwriting of so much of the documents as isalleged to be in that person's handwriting must be proved to be in his handwriting. "31. It was also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in S. Gopal Reddy vs. State of AP (1996) 4 SCC 596that Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 enjoins before a document can be looked into, it hasto be proved. Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 ofcourse, does not prescribe any particularmode of proof. Section 47 of the Indian Evidence Act, which occurs in the chapter relating to"relevancy of facts" provides that the opinion of a person who is acquainted with the handwriting ofa particular person is a relevant fact. Similarly, opinion of the handwriting expert is also a relevantfact for identifying any handwriting. The ordinary method of proving a document is by calling as awitness the person who had executed the document or saw it being executed or signed or isotherwise qualified and competent to express his opinion as to his handwriting. There are someother modes of proof of documents also as by comparison of the handwriting as envisaged underSection 73 of the Indian Evidence Act or through the evidence of a handwriting Expert underSection 45 of the Indian Evidence Act, besides by the admission of the person against whom thedocument is intended to be used. The receiver of the document, on establishing his acquaintancewith the hand-writing of the persons and competence to identify the writing with which he isfamiliar, may also prove a document. These modes are legitimate methods of proving documentsbut before they can Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 16 of 20be accepted they must bear sufficient strength to carry conviction.32. What follows from above judgment is that when the execution of the documents was denied bythe accused, it was incumbent upon the complainant to lead evidence to prove the document Ex.CW-1/A. In the present case he failed to do so. Hence, the document on which complainant relies toprove the factum of payment of earnest money to the complainant cannot be relied upon by thisCourt as the same has not been proved by the complainant in accordance with the Indian EvidenceAct.33. The second leg of defence is that some documents and 8-9 cheques including the cheque inquestion was stolen from the house of the accused persons in November 2016. It was stated byImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/12accused no. 1 in her examination as well as in her cross-examination dated 28.11.2019 that thecheques were stolen on 11.11.2016 when the complainant visited their house and that she came toknow about the same when she went to the electricity office for installation of meter. It was furtherstated by accused no. 1 that her son Salim Malik i.e accused no.2 had also lodged online policecomplaint Ex.DW-1/1 on the 12.11.2016 regarding the same. She also stated that she is not aware asto whether in the complaint filed with the police Ex.DW-1/1,it is stated that documents and chequeswere lost on 10.11.2016 as she is an illiterate lady. The copy of the complaint for theft of cheques andcopy of the complaint under Section 200 Cr. P. C for initiating criminal proceedings against accusedpersons is placed on record. Curiously enough, the complainant has not disputed the copy of saidcomplaints Ex. DW-1/1 and Ex. DW-1/2 and neither has the complainant asked any questionspertaining to the complaint filed by accused against the complainant.34. This leads to the inference that these questions were deliberately avoided for the reasons bestknown to the complainant. Any prudent litigant would have asked the follow up questions andwould have also demanded copy of complaint filed against the complainant by the accused persons.The complainant, however, chose to conveniently ignore all these requisites and satisfied himself bymerely putting suggestions. The entire gamut of facts discussed above behooves me to believe theversion put forth by the accused regarding the theft of his cheques including the subject cheque andthe Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 17 of 20 complainantcould not extract anything or produce anything that could destroy the line that could destroy the lineof defence established by the accused. The infirmity in the date of occurrence of theft as mentionedin the e-FIR filed by the accused no. 2 and in the cross- examination of accused no. 1 is not sufficientto prove the liability of the accused persons. The accused no.1 stated in her cross-examination thatshe is an illiterate lady and does not remember the date mentioned in the e-FIR filed by her son.35. Moreover, the complainant has allegedly advanced total earnest money of Rs.4,50,000/- toaccused in cash out his savings, which is in contravention of Section 269SS of Income Tax Act, 1961,wherein it is specifically laid down that if a loan is advanced which is more than Rs.20,000/-, it hasto be by way of writing reflected in the books of account. However, in the present case, there is nodocument of alleged savings of the complainant and complainant also stated in hiscross-examination that he did not disclose the present savings in his ITR. The Hon'ble High Court inKulvinder Singh Vs. Kafil Ahmed Cri.L.P.478 of 2011, also held that when alleged loan incontravention of Section 269SS of Income Tax Act, 1961, it clearly creates doubt regardingtruthfulness of stand taken by the complainant about advancement of loan.36. In the case of 'Kulvinder Singh Vs Kafeel Ahmad' Cri.L.P.478 of 2011, decided on 04.01.2021,Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that the basic principal in criminal law is that the guilt of theaccused/respondent, must be proved beyond reasonable doubts and if there is any slightest doubtabout the commission of an offence, then the benefit has to accrue to him.37. At the same time, it is important to underscore the established canon of Criminal law that in inorder to pass a conviction in a criminal case, the accused "must be" guilty and not merely "may be"guilty. The mental distance between "may be" to "must be" guilty is a long one and must travel noton surmises and conjectures, but by cogent evidence. In this case, after the accused successfullyImran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/13rebutted the presumption of consideration by raising a doubt on the very factum of transaction. Theaccused has clearly presented a case which is superior in way and as per the settled law, this is allwhat is required, as pre-ponderance of probabilities is not a rigorous standard of proof, but onlyImran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 18 of 20 so much evidence asmakes the court lean in, in favour of one side and not the other. Consequently, the benefit of doubtmust go to the accused. The material on record does not suggest that the accused "must be" guiltywhichever way one looks at it.38. Apart from the testimony of the complainant, there is not even an iota of evidence on record tocorroborate and prove the assertion of the complainant that the cheque in question were issued fordischarging the outstanding liability towards the complainant. Complainant has not brought muchevidence on record to prove his contention once the accused has rebutted the presumption. Thecomplainant must lead affirmative cogent evidence to establish the precise and quantified liability ofaccused towards him on the date on which the cheque in question was presented to him forencashment. Consequently, the complainant has failed to prove whether on the date of presentationof cheque in question, the accused was under a legal liability to pay a sum of Rs. 4,50,000/- to thecomplainant. Complainant has failed to bring on record sufficient evidence to prove that the saidcheque in question was issued to discharge the legal liability towards the complainant.39. It is a settled position of law that the case of complainant should stand on its own leg. It cannottake advantage of the weakness of the defence, nor can the Court, make out a case for prosecutionand convict the accused on that basis. If the accused is not able to prove the defence taken by him, itdoes not mean the prosecution version is necessarily correct. Therefore, the contention of ld.Counsel for complainant regarding the weak defence of the accused appears to be of no use in sailingthrough the case of complainant as the complainant has himself failed to prove the necessaryingredients which are required to bring home the guilt of accused under Section138 N.I. Act.40. In order to rebut the presumption of Section 139 of the Act, the accused is not required to bringdirect evidence but should adduce sufficient cogent evidence or can rely upon the circumstanceswhich the shows the probability of non-existence of consideration. Accused has to prove his defenceon the scale of preponderance of possibility as held in Kumar Export Vs. Sharma Carpets (supra). Inpresent matter, from the case of the complainant itself coupled with the consistence line of defencetaken by him, the accused Imran Malik vs. Hakiman Khatoon & Anr CC No. 16834/2017 Page no. 19of 20 has been able to raise a reasonable probable defence and has been able to rebut thepresumption under Section118/139 of the Act and the reverse onus cast upon him, has beendischarged.41. Since the accused has rebutted the statutory presumption, the onus again shifts back upon thecomplainant. Now the presumptions under Section118 & 139 of the Act will not again come for therescue of the complainant and case of the complainant has to stand on his own legs. In the instantcase, complainant has failed to discharge the burden of proof and could not proof his case beyondreasonable doubt.Imran Malik vs . Hakiman Khatoon & Anr Cc No. ... on 15 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66522057/1442. In the light of foregoing reasons, it is clear that accused Hakiman Khatoon and Salim Malik havesucceeded in rebutting the presumption of legal liability and the complainant has failed to prove thesame affirmatively. As a result, accused Hakiman Khatoon and Salim Malik stands acquitted fromthe offence u/s 138 NI Act.
