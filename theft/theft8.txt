In the present writ petition the petitioner has assailed the order dated 05.11.2003, passed by theDeputy Commissioner of Police, Vadodara City, dismissing the petitioner from the service as well asthe orders passed in the Appeal and Revision Application i.e. dated 26.12.2003 and dated12.01.2006 respectively.2. The brief facts are as under.2.1 The petitioner was serving as a Police Constable with the respondents since 1984. On 15.03.1990,the petitioner was C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 suspended from service inMukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/1view of the serious charges of theft of various motorcycles and selling them. The petitioner wasserved with a charge-sheet on 12.01.1994, inter alia for the charges that he had stolen motorcycles,which are mentioned therein by using duplicate keys and selling them by replacing them byduplicate number plates. The petitioner did not reply to the charge-sheet for the reason that thedocuments, as demanded by him, were not supplied.2.2 Simultaneously, criminal complaints were also registered against the petitioner being CriminalCases Nos.1808 of 1990, 1809 of 1990, 1769 of 1990, 1790 of 1990 and 1791 of 1990. The petitionerwas acquitted in the criminal offences, which were registered for the offence under Section 379 ofthe Indian Penal Code, 1860.2.3 Thereafter, it appears that in view of the departmental proceedings, the petitioner has beendismissed from service by the impugned order dated 05.11.2003, which was subsequently confirmedin the appeal as well as in the revision application, filed by the petitioner.3. Learned advocate Mr.Upadyay, appearing for the petitioner has submitted that the impugnedorders are required to be quashed and set aside, as the petitioner was acquitted in the criminalcharges, which are based on the similar facts. It is submitted that though the judgment of acquittalwas pointed out before the disciplinary authority as well as before the inquiry officer, the same havenot been considered in its true perspective and, therefore, the impugned orders are required to bequashed and set aside. He has submitted that a lenient view may be taken against theC/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 petitioner, looking to the fact that he isretiring in the year 2022. It is also submitted by him that some of the witnesses have not supportedthe case of the respondent department and hence, the inquiry officer has fallen in error inappreciating the deposition of such witnesses and the charges are proved against the petitioner onlyby placing reliance on the statements of some of the witnesses, who have been deposed against him.Thus, it is submitted that the impugned orders may be set aside. No further submission is advanced.4. Per contra, learned Assistant Government Pleader Mr.Rohan Shah, has submitted that thedepartmental proceedings are conducting after following the statutory rules of the Bombay Police(Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1956, after affording full opportunity of hearing to the petitionerand the cross-examination of the petitioner was also done by the disciplinary authority. It issubmitted by the learned Assistant Government Pleader that it is not the case of the petitioner thatany of the statutory provisions have been violated while holding the departmental proceedings. Hehas submitted that merely the petitioner has been acquitted in the criminal proceedings, the samewould not be ipso facto render the disciplinary proceedings as void since the standard of proof in thedepartmental proceedings and criminal proceedings, is different. Learned Assistant GovernmentPleader has placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Union of India andothers versus Dalbir Singh, AIR 2021 SC 4504. Thus, he has submitted that the writ petition maynot be entertained.C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022Mukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/25. I have heard the learned advocates for respective parties to the lis. I have also perused therelevant documents as pointed out by the learned advocates for the respective parties.6. The facts which are established from the record are that the petitioner was working as a PoliceConstable under the respondents and he was issued a charge-sheet inter alia alleging that he wasinvolved in the theft of various motorcycles and used to sell them by affixing fallacious numberplates and thus, it was alleged that he was negligent and his conduct was unbecoming of a policeofficer. It was also alleged that such conduct of the petitioner would result into loss of confidence inpolice. A detailed departmental inquiry was held against the petitioner and various witnesses wereexamined in the departmental inquiry. The petitioner was afforded full opportunity of hearing in theproceedings and the inquiry officer, after examining the witnesses, has held the charges as proved.From the statement of witnesses, it was proved that the petitioner used to replace the originalnumber plates of the vehicles by duplicate number. The petitioner was also given an opportunity tocross-examine the witnesses. It is not alleged that the departmental proceedings were held inviolation of any statutory rules or the petitioner was not afforded any opportunity of hearing. Theprimary contention raised by the petitioner is that he was acquitted from the criminal offence, whichis premised on the similar facts. This Court has also perused the impugned orders and thedisciplinary proceedings. After referring to the judgment of acquittal, the disciplinary authority hascategorically stated that the acquittal would not have any effect on the outcome of the departmentalproceedings since the witnesses have C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022supported the charges levelled against the petitioner. The dismissal order, which was challenged inthe appeal and revision, has been confirmed by the authorities. At this stage, it would be apposite torefer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of Dalbir Singh (supra), whereby the SupremeCourt, while examining the issue of departmental proceedings vis-a-vis acquittal in criminalproceedings, has held thus :"22. This Court in Union of India & Ors. v. P. Gunasekaran had laid down the broadparameters for the exercise of jurisdiction of 4 (2015) 2 SCC 610, judicial review. TheCourt held as under:"12. Despite the well-settled position, it is painfully disturbing to note that the HighCourt has acted as an appellate authority in the disciplinary proceedings,reappreciating even the evidence before the enquiry officer. The finding on Charge Iwas accepted by the disciplinary authority and was also endorsed by the CentralAdministrative Tribunal. In disciplinary proceedings, the High Court is not andcannot act as a second court of first appeal. The High Court, in exercise of its powersunder Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India, shall not venture intore-appreciation of the evidence. The High Court can only see whether:(a) the enquiry is held by a competent authority;(b) the enquiry is held according to the procedure prescribed in that behalf;Mukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/3(c) there is violation of the principles of natural justice in conducting theproceedings;(d) the authorities have disabled themselves from reaching a fair conclusion by someconsiderations extraneous to the evidence and merits of the case;(e) the authorities have allowed themselves to be influenced by irrelevant orextraneous considerations;(f) the conclusion, on the very face of it, is so wholly arbitrary and capricious that noreasonable person could ever have arrived at such conclusion;(g) the disciplinary authority had erroneously failed to admit the admissible andmaterial evidence;(h) the disciplinary authority had erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence whichinfluenced the finding;(i) the finding of fact is based on no evidence.13. Under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India, the High Court shall not:(i) reappreciate the evidence;(ii) interfere with the conclusions in the enquiry, in case the same has beenconducted in accordance with law;(iii) go into the adequacy of the evidence;(iv) go into the reliability of the evidence;(v) interfere, if there be some legal evidence on which findings can be based.(vi) correct the error of fact however grave it may appear to be;C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022(vii) go into the proportionality of punishment unless it shocks its conscience."23. In another Judgment reported as B.C Chaturvedi v. Union of India & Ors.5, it washeld that the power of judicial review is meant to ensure that the individual receivesfair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion which the authority reaches isnecessarily correct in the eye of the court.Mukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/4The Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which thedecision is made. The Court is to examine as to whether the inquiry was held by a competent officeror whether rules of natural justice are complied with. This Court held as under:-"12. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner inwhich the decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant to ensure that theindividual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion which theauthority reaches is necessarily correct in the eye of the court. When an inquiry isconducted on charges of misconduct by a public servant, the Court/Tribunal isconcerned to determine whether the inquiry was held by a competent officer orwhether rules of natural justice are complied with. Whether the findings orconclusions are based on some evidence, the authority entrusted with the power tohold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and authority to reach a finding of fact orconclusion. But that finding must be based on some evidence. Neither the technicalrules of Evidence Act nor of proof of fact or evidence as defined therein, apply todisciplinary proceeding. When the authority accepts that evidence and conclusionreceives support therefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that thedelinquent officer is guilty of the charge. The Court/Tribunal in its power of judicialreview does not act as appellate authority to reappreciate the evidence and to arriveat its own independent findings on the evidence. The Court/Tribunal may interferewhere the authority held the proceedings against the delinquent officer in a mannerinconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in violation of statutory rulesprescribing the mode of inquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by thedisciplinary authority is based on no evidence. If the conclusion or finding be such asno reasonable person would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may interferewith the conclusion or the finding, and mould the relief so as to make it appropriateto the facts of each case.13. The disciplinary authority is the sole judge of facts. Where appeal is presented, theappellate authority has coextensive power to re-appreciate the evidence or the natureof punishment. In a disciplinary inquiry, the strict proof of legal evidence andfindings on that evidence are not relevant. Adequacy of evidence or reliability ofevidence cannot be permitted to be canvassed before the Court/Tribunal. In Union ofIndia v. H.C. Goel [(1964) 4 SCR 718 : AIR 1964 SC 364 : (1964) 1 LLJ 38] this Courtheld at p. 728 that if the conclusion, upon consideration of the evidence reached bythe disciplinary authority, is perverse or suffers from patent error on the face of therecord or based on no evidence at all, a writ of certiorari could be issued."C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/202224. This Court in Management of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation(Coimbatore) Limited v. M. Chandrasekaran held that in exercise of power of judicialreview, the Labour Commissioner exceeded his jurisdiction in reappreciating theevidence adduced before the enquiry officer and in substituting his own judgment toMukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/5that of the disciplinary authority. It was not a case of no legal evidence. The questionas to decision of the disciplinary authority of dismissing the respondent is just andproper could be assailed by the respondent in appropriate proceedings. Consideringthe fact that there was adequate material produced in the departmental enquiryevidencing that fatal accident was caused by the respondent while driving the vehicleon duty, the burden to prove that the accident happened due to some other causethan his own negligence was on the respondent. The doctrine of res ipsa 6 (2016) 16SCC 16 loquitur squarely applies to the fact situation. The Court held as under:"11. The respondent on the other hand contends that the Commissioner has appliedthe well-settled legal position that there can be no presumption of misconduct by theemployees. That, charge must be proved by the Department during the inquiry.Non-examination of the material witnesses such as eyewitnesses present on the spot,conductor and passengers, travelling on the same bus was fatal. For, it entails in notsubstantiating the charges against the respondent and failure to discharge the initialonus resting on the Department to prove the charge as framed. According to therespondent, no fault can be found with the tangible reasons recorded by theCommissioner as noticed by the Single Judge (reproduced above); and resultantly,the conclusion of the Commissioner of not according approval to the order ofdismissal is just and proper. It is submitted that the Single Judge was justified inallowing the writ petition preferred by the respondent and issuing direction to theappellant to reinstate him with back wages and continuity of service and all attendantbenefits accrued to him."25. This Court in Ajit Kumar Nag v. General Manager (PJ), Indian Oil Corpn.Ltd., Haldia & Ors.7 held that the degree of proof which is necessary to order a conviction isdifferent from the degree of proof necessary to record the commission of delinquency. In criminallaw, burden of proof is on the prosecution and unless the prosecution is able to prove the guilt of theaccused "beyond reasonable doubt", he cannot be convicted by a court of law. In a departmentalenquiry, on the other hand, penalty can be imposed on the delinquent officer on a finding recordedon the basis of "preponderance of probability". It was held as under:"11. As far as acquittal of the appellant by a criminal court is concerned, in ouropinion, the said order does not preclude the Corporation from taking an action if itis otherwise permissible. In our judgment, the law is fairly well settled. Acquittal by acriminal court would not debar an employer from exercising power in accordancewith the Rules and Regulations in force. The two proceedings, criminal anddepartmental, are entirely different. They operate in different fields and havedifferent objectives.Whereas the object of criminal trial is to inflict appropriate punishment on the offender, the purposeof enquiry proceedings is to deal with the delinquent departmentally and to impose penalty inaccordance with the service rules. In a criminal trial, incriminating statement made by the accusedMukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/6in certain circumstances or before certain officers is totally inadmissible in evidence. Such strictrules of evidence and procedure would not C/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022apply to departmental proceedings. The degree of proof which is necessary to order a conviction isdifferent from the degree of proof necessary to record the commission of delinquency. The rulerelating to appreciation of evidence in the two proceedings is also not similar. In criminal law,burden of proof is on the prosecution and unless the prosecution is able to prove the guilt of theaccused "beyond reasonable doubt", he cannot be convicted by a court of law. In a departmentalenquiry, on the other hand, penalty can be imposed on the delinquent officer on a finding recordedon the basis of "preponderance of probability". Acquittal of the appellant by a Judicial Magistrate,therefore, does not ipso facto absolve him from the liability under the disciplinary jurisdiction of theCorporation. We are, therefore, unable to uphold the contention of the appellant that since he wasacquitted by a criminal court, the impugned order dismissing him from service deserves to bequashed and set aside ." (Emphasis Supplied)26. This Court in Noida Entrepreneurs Association v. NOIDA & Ors.8 held that the criminalprosecution is launched for an offence for violation of a duty, the offender owes to the society or forbreach of which law has provided that the offender shall make satisfaction to the public, whereas,the departmental inquiry is to maintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. Itwas held as under:"11. A bare perusal of the order which has been quoted in its totality goes to show thatthe same is not based on any rational foundation. The conceptual difference betweena departmental inquiry and criminal proceedings has not been kept in view. Evenorders passed by the executive have to be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness.[See Tata Cellular v. Union of India [(1994) 6 SCC 651] and Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd.v. U.T., Chandigarh [(2004) 2 SCC 130] .The conceptual difference betweendepartmental proceedings and criminal proceedings have been highlighted by thisCourt in several cases. Reference may be made to Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. T.Srinivas [(2004) 7 SCC 442 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1011] , Hindustan Petroleum Corpn.Ltd. v. Sarvesh Berry [(2005) 10 SCC 471 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1605] and UttaranchalRTC v. Mansaram Nainwal [(2006) 6 SCC 366 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1341] ."8. ... The purpose of departmental inquiry and of prosecution are two different anddistinct aspects. The criminal prosecution is launched for an offense for violation of aduty, the offender owes to the society or for breach of which law has provided that theoffender shall make satisfaction to the public. So crime is an act of commission inviolation of law or of omission of public duty. The departmental inquiry is tomaintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. It would, therefore,be expedient that the disciplinary proceedings are conducted and completed asexpeditiously as possible. It is not, therefore, desirable to lay down any guidelines asinflexible rules in which the departmental proceedings may or may not be stayedpending trial in the criminal cases against the delinquent officer. Each case requiresto be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. There would beno bar to proceed simultaneously with departmental inquiry and trial of a criminalMukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/7case unless the charge in the criminal trial is of grave nature involving complicatedquestions of fact and law. Offense generally implies infringement of publicC/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 duty, as distinguished frommere private rights punishable under criminal law. When the trial for a criminaloffense is conducted it should be in accordance with proof of the offense as per theevidence defined under the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 [in short 'theEvidence Act']. The converse is the case of departmental inquiry. The inquiry in adepartmental proceeding relates to conduct or breach of duty of the delinquentofficer to punish him for his misconduct defined under the relevant statutory rules orlaw. That the strict standard of proof or applicability of the Evidence Act standsexcluded is a settled legal position. ... Under these circumstances, what is required tobe seen is whether the departmental inquiry would seriously prejudice the delinquentin his defense at the trial in a criminal case. It is always a question of fact to beconsidered in each case depending on its own facts and circumstances."29. The burden of proof in the departmental proceedings is not of beyond reasonabledoubt as is the principle in the criminal trial but probabilities of the misconduct. Thedelinquent such as the writ petitioner could examine himself to rebut the allegationsof misconduct including use of personal weapon. In fact, the reliance of the writpetitioner is upon a communication dated 1.5.2014 made to the Commandantthrough the inquiry officer. He has stated that he has not fired on higher officers andthat he was out of camp at the alleged time of incident. Therefore, a false case hasbeen made against him. His further stand is that it was a terrorist attack andterrorists have fired on the Camp. None of the departmental witnesses have beeneven suggested about any terrorist attack or that the writ petitioner was out of camp.Constable D.K. Mishra had immobilized the writ petitioner whereas all otherwitnesses have seen the writ petitioner being immobilized and being removed toquarter guard. PW-5 Brij Kishore Singh deposed that 3-4 soldiers had taken theSelf-Loading Rifle (S.L.R.) of the writ petitioner in their possession. Therefore, theallegations in the chargesheet dated 25.2.2013 that the writ petitioner has fired fromthe official weapon is a reliable finding returned by the Departmental Authorities onthe basis of evidence placed before them. It is not a case of no evidence, which alonewould warrant interference by the High Court in exercise of power of judicial review.It is not the case of the writ petitioner that there was any infraction of any rule orregulations or the violation of the principles of natural justice. The best availableevidence had been produced by the appellants in the course of enquiry conductedafter long lapse of time."7. The Supreme Court while referring to the judgment in case of Noida entrepreneurs AssociationVs. Noida and others, (2007) 10 SCC 385 in the afore-noted judgement has been held that thepurpose of departmental inquiry and the prosecution are different and have distinguished aspects.The criminal prosecution is under offence for violation of a duty, the offender owes to the society orfor breach of which law has provided that the offender shall make satisfaction to theC/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 public, whereas the departmental inquiry isMukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/8to maintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. It is also held that the criminaltrial is conducted, is conducted as per the evidence defined under the provisions of the IndianEvidence Act, 1872 and conversely in case of departmental inquiry, the standard of proof dependsupon preponderence and probabilities. It is also observed that the inquiry in departmentalproceedings relates to the conduct of breach of duty of the delinquent official for punishing for hismisconduct which are defined under the relevant statute and rules. As noted hereinabove, itdisciplinary authority has considered the acquittal of the petitioner in criminal cases and it isspecifically observed that the witnesses in the departmental proceedings have supported the case ofthe department.8. In the recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of Maharasthra State Road TransportCorporation vs Dilip Uttam Jayabhay, AIR 2022 SC 238 while examining a similar has held thus:"10.4 Even from the judgment and order passed by the criminal court it appears thatthe criminal court acquitted the respondent based on the hostility of the witnesses;the evidence led by the interested witnesses; lacuna in examination of theinvestigating officer; panch for the spot panchnama of the incident, etc. Therefore,criminal court held that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against therespondent beyond reasonable doubt. On the contrary in the departmentalproceedings the misconduct of driving the vehicle rashly and negligently whichcaused accident and due to which four persons died has been established and proved.As per the cardinal principle of law an acquittal in a criminal trial has no bearing orrelevance on the disciplinary proceedings as the standard of proof in both the casesare different and the proceedings operate in different fields and with differentobjectives. Therefore, the Industrial Court has erred in giving much stress on theacquittal of the respondent by the criminal court."Thus, the Apex Court has held that "As per the cardinal principle of law an acquittal in a criminaltrial has no bearing or relevance on the disciplinary proceedings as the standard ofC/SCA/2532/2007 JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 proof in both the cases are different and theproceedings operate in different fields and with different objectives". In the case before the ApexCourt, the acquittal was not considered because the same was based on the witnesses have turnedhostile and the evidence led by the interested witnesses, etc. In the present case, also the petitionerhas been acquitted on similar grounds. Hence, merely because he has been acquitted in criminalcase, the findings of the disciplinary proceedings which is premised on independent witnessescannot get diluted.9. The Supreme Court has also rendered decision in case of Union of India versus P. Gunashekhar,(2015) 2 SCC 610, wherein prescribed the following parameters:"13. Under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India, the High Court shall not:(i) reappreciate the evidence;Mukesh Chandrakantbhai ... vs The Commissioner Of Police on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82731018/9(ii) interfere with the conclusions in the enquiry, in case the same has beenconducted in accordance with law;(iii) go into the adequacy of the evidence;(iv) go into the reliability of the evidence;(v) interfere, if there be some legal evidence on which findings can be based.(vi) correct the error of fact however grave it may appear to be;(vii) go into the proportionality of punishment unless it shocks its conscience."Thus, it is directed by the Apex Court that the High Court shall not re-appreciate the evidence,interfere with conclusion in inquiry in the case the same has been conducted in accordance with lawor go into adequacy or reliability of the evidence and cannot interfere even if there is some legalevidence on which findings is based and correct the error of fact however grave it may appear to be.It is also held that the High Court cannot examine the proportionality of the C/SCA/2532/2007JUDGMENT DATED: 14/03/2022 punishment unless it unless it shock its conscience. Thepetitioner, who was serving as a Police Constable in a disciplined force was not expected to indulgein grave and serious misconduct of stealing and selling the motorcycles. In the instant case, thisCourt does not find that the punishment of dismissal is disproportionate to the misconduct.10. Similar view has been taken in the case of State of Karnataka and other Vs. N. Gangaraj, (2015) 2SCC 610, wherein the High Court has held that the scope of judicial review is only confined todecision making process. It is held that in case the disciplinary authority has admitted the finding ofthe inquiry officer finding the delinquent guilty of misconduct, which is confirmed in appeal, theTribunal and High Court cannot interfere with the findings of facts recorded by re-appreciatingevidence, as if they are appellate authority.11. In the present case, as noted hereinabove, the entire case of the petitioner is premised onacquittal which cannot ipso facto result in diluting the order of punishment. It is not the case of thepetitioner that the respondents have totally ignored his acquittal. After considering the acquittal ofthe petitioner, the disciplinary authority has exercised its discretion as per the service rules, and hasthought appropriate to impose the punishment of dismissal looking to the proved seriousmisconduct.12. Hence, the writ petition fails. Rule discharged.Sd/-(A. S.
