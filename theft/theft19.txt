STATEMENT OF ACCUSED U/S 313 Cr.P.C :State vs . Mustkim Khan & Ors. on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190706362/23.1 Nothing incriminating has come on record against the accused persons and there are nocircumstances appearing against them in prosecution evidence and therefore, examination ofaccused persons u/s 313 Cr.P.C. was dispensed with.4. ARGUMENTS:4.1 Ld. APP for the State has argued that on a combined reading of prosecution witnesses'testimony, offences U/s 392/34 IPC are proved beyond reasonable doubt, against the accusedpersons.FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim & Ors. 3 4.2 On the other hand, Ld. counsel foraccused persons have argued that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused personsbeyond reasonable doubt due to tainted testimony of PWs, hence accused persons are entitled to beacquitted.5. BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE REASONS FOR THE DECISION.5.1 Arguments adduced by Ld. APP for State and Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused persons havebeen heard. Evidences and documents on record perused carefully.5.2 I have bestowed my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions made before me. Accusedis indicted for the offences U/s 392/34 IPC(a) Section 390 IPC states that, "In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.When theft is robbery:- theft is "robbery" if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committingthe theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, theoffender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt orwrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.When extortion is robbery- Extortion is "robbery" if the offender, at the time of committing theextortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting thatperson in fear of instant death, of instant hurt or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or tosome other person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there todeliver up the things extorted".Explanation - The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person isfear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim & Ors. 4(b) Section 392 IPC states that "whoever commits robbery shall be punished with rigorousimprisonment for a term may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the robberybe committed on the highway between sunsent and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended toState vs . Mustkim Khan & Ors. on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190706362/3fourteen years".(c) Section 34 IPC states that "when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of thecommon intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it weredone by him alone".5.3 PW-1 Sh. Monu Singhal is the complainant in the present case and he has stated in hisexamination-in-chief that the incident in question took place on 15.02.2009 at around 04.00-04.15pm at Zakhira Flyover, Delhi, when he was going on his scooty towards his office situated at AnandParbat. He has further stated that all the accused persons came from backside on a motorcycle andrammed the same in his scooty due to which he fell down on the road and they took away his scootywherein an amount of Rs.8,00,000/- were kept by him. Thereafter, he made a PCR call andapprised the police about facts and circumstances in which the incident had taken place, and in thisregard he lodged a complaint Ex. PW1/A with the police.5.4 In the present case recovery, of stolen property has been conducted by the police from theaccused persons Mustkim and Alam Ali, and the other two accused persons Prahlad and Azad hadbeen arrested upon the disclosure statement of co-accused persons. The complainant did not knowthe accused persons prior to the incident, and accused persons have admittedly not been arrestedupon the identification of the complainant. It is pertinent to note that the complainant has clearlystated in his examination-in-chief that he FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim &Ors. 5 could not see the features of the accused persons as they had fled away in a flash. Upon this,the prosecution proceeded to put leading question to the witness, whereupon, he has categoricallystated that he never told the IO that he can identify the robbers if they are produced before him andhas denied mentioning this fact in the statement Ex. PW1/A wherein it is so recorded from point Ato A1. PW-1 has further stated that he identified the accused persons Mustkeem and Alam Ali inTihar Jail vide proceedings Mark P1/1 and Mark P1/2 bearing his signature at point A. He hasfurther deposed that photos of the accused persons had been shown to him by the IO beforeconducting TIP proceedings, only upon which he could identify the accused Mustkeem and Alam Aliin Tihar Jail. He has denied being won over by the accused outside the Court, and not deliberately orintentionally stating true facts before the Court. In his cross-examination by ld. defence counsel,PW-1 has categorically admitted that no incident of robbery was committed with him by accusedpersons Mustkeem and Alam Ali.5.5 Accused Azad @ Bablu had already been released u/s 169 Cr.P.C. for lack of evidence vide orderof this Court dated 26.06.2019, as neither the TIP of the accused succeeded nor was any recoveryeffected from him.5.6 As far as accused Prahlad Singh @ Sonu is concerned, neither any recovery has been effectedfrom him, nor TIP proceedings have been conducted for his identification by the complainant.Accused Prahlad has already pleaded guilty for the offence u/s 174-A IPC and he has been sentencedto the period of imprisonment already undergone by him in judicial custody vide order of this Courtdated 17.10.2019. No other offences have been FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim& Ors. 6 alleged against him.State vs . Mustkim Khan & Ors. on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190706362/45.7 In the light of testimony of the aforesaid witnesses, who are the sole eye witness/ victims/material witnesses and in the absence of the testimony of any other eye witness during investigation,the fact that accused persons committed robbery with complainant Sh. Monu and his friend Abdulon the alleged date, time and place, can never be proved by the prosecution, even if the remainingwitnesses who are merely formal witnesses testify.5.8 Time and again, Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble Delhi High Court, have emphasized theneed for speedy investigations and trial as both are mandated by the letter and spirit of theprovisions of the CrPC. (In particular, Sections 197, 173, 309, 437 (6) and 468 etc.) and theconstitutional protection enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. Inspired by the broad sweepand content of Article 21 as interpreted by a seven-Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court inManeka Gandhi Vs. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248 & Anr. & in Hussainara Khatoon & Ors. Vs.Home Secretary, State of Bihar (1980) 1 SCC 81, the Court had said that Article 21 confers afundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except according toprocedure established by law; that such procedure is not some semblance of a procedure but theprocedure should be 'reasonable, fair and just'; and therefrom flows, without doubt, the right tospeedy trial. It was also observed that no procedure which does not ensure a reasonably quick trialcan be regarded as 'reasonable, fair or just' and it would fall foul of Article 21. The Court clarifiedthat speedy trial means reasonably expeditious trial which is an integral and essential part of thefundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.The exposition of Article 21 in Hussainara Khatoon's case (supra) was exhaustively consideredafresh by the Constitution Bench of Hon'ble FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim &Ors. 7 Supreme Court in Abdul Rehman Antulay & Ors. Vs. R.S. Nayak & Anr. (1992 1 SCC 225).Referring to a number of decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court and the American precedents on theSixth Amendment of their Constitution, making the right to a speedy and public trial aconstitutional guarantee, the Court formulated as many as eleven propositions with a note ofcaution that these were not exhaustive and were meant only to serve as guidelines. For the sake ofbrevity, this Court does not propose to reproduce all the said propositions and it would suffice tonote the gist thereof. These are:-(i) fair, just and reasonable procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution creates a right in theaccused to be tried speedily;(ii) right to speedy trial flowing from Article 21 encompasses all the stages, namely the stage ofinvestigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and retrial;(iii) in every case where the speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the first question to be putand answered is -- who is responsible for the delay?;(iv) while determining whether undue delay has occurred (resulting in violation of right to speedytrial) one must have regard to all the attendant circumstances, including nature of offence, numberof accused and witnesses, the work-load of the court concerned, prevailing local conditions and soon-- what is called, the systemic delays;State vs . Mustkim Khan & Ors. on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190706362/5(v) each and every delay does not necessarily prejudice the accused. Some delays may indeed workto his advantage. However, inordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice.In this context, the fact of incarceration of accused will also be a relevant fact. The prosecutionshould not be allowed to become a persecution. But when does the prosecution become persecution,again depends upon the facts of a given case;(vi) ultimately, the court has to balance and weigh several relevant factors--'balancing test' or'balancing process'--and determine in each case whether the right to speedy trial has been denied;(vii) Ordinarily speaking, where the court comes to the conclusion FIR No. 80/2019, PS Moti NagarState Vs. Mustkim & Ors. 8 that right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed the charges orthe conviction, as the case may be, shall be quashed. But this is not the only course open and havingregard to the nature of offence and other circumstances when the court feels that quashing ofproceedings cannot be in the interest of justice, it is open to the court to make appropriate orders,including fixing the period for completion of trial;(viii) it is neither advisable nor feasible to prescribe any outer time- limit for conclusion of allcriminal proceedings. In every case of complaint of denial of right to speedy trial, it is primarily forthe prosecution to justify and explain the delay. At the same time, it is the duty of the court to weighall the circumstances of a given case before pronouncing upon the complaint; (ix) an objection basedon denial of right to speedy trial and for relief on that account, should first be addressed to the HighCourt. Even if the High Court entertains such a plea, ordinarily it should not stay the proceedings,except in a case of grave and exceptional nature. Such proceedings in High Court must, however, bedisposed of on a priority basis.Notwithstanding elaborate enunciation of Article 21 of the Constitution in Abdul Rehman Antulay(supra), and rejection of the fervent plea of proponents of right to speedy trial for laying downtime-limits as bar beyond which a criminal trial shall not proceed pronouncements of Hon'bleSupreme Court Court in "Common Cause" A Registered Society Vs. Union of India (UOI) & Ors.(1996) 4 SCC 33, "Common Cause", A Registered Society Vs. Union of India & Ors. (1996) 6 SCC775, Raj Deo Sharma Vs. State of Bihar (1998) 7 SCC 507 and Raj Deo Sharma II Vs. State of Bihar(1999) 7 SCC 604 gave rise to some confusion on the question whether an outer time limit forconclusion of criminal proceedings could be prescribed whereafter the trial court would be obligedto terminate the proceedings and necessarily acquit or discharge the accused.The confusion on the issue was set at rest by a seven-Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.Ramachandra Rao Vs. State of Karnataka16. (2002) 4 SCC 578. Speaking for the majority, RC LahotiJ. (as his Lordship then was) while affirming that the dictum in A.R. Antulay's FIR No. 80/2019, PSMoti Nagar State Vs. Mustkim & Ors. 9 case (supra) is correct and still holds the field and thepropositions emerging from Article 21 of the Constitution and expounding the right to speedy triallaid down as guidelines in the said case adequately take care of right to speedy trial, it was held thatguidelines laid down in the A.R. Antulay's case (supra) are not exhaustive but only illustrative. Theyare not intended to operate as hard and fast rules or to be applied like a strait- jacket formula. Theirapplicability would depend on the fact-situation of each case as it is difficult to foresee all situationsState vs . Mustkim Khan & Ors. on 14 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190706362/6and no generalization can be made. It has also been held that it is neither advisable, nor feasible, norjudicially permissible to draw or prescribe an outer limit for conclusion of all criminal proceedings.Nonetheless, the criminal courts should exercise their available powers such as those under Sections309, 311 and 258 of CrPC to effectuate the right to speedy trial.5.9 The Hon'ble Supreme Court has further stated in Pankaj Kumar Vs. State of Mahrashtra (2008)16 SCC 117 and Jayendra Vishnu Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra (2009) 7 SCC 107 that a personcharged with an offence and submitted before the process of law, has also a right of speedy trial,which has been considered as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Itwas held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled Satish Mehra vs. Delhi Administration &Anrs. reported as 1996 JCC 507, that "in case where there is no prospect of the case ending inconviction, the valuable time of the Court should not be wasted for holding a trial only for thepurpose of formally completing the procedure to pronounce the conclusion on the future date".5.10 Accordingly, in view of the testimony of all the material witnesses, and in the light of theaforesaid discussion and cited judgments, and the fact that the examination of remaining witnesseswho are formal witnesses, will not be of any help in altering the conclusion arrived at, this Courthereby acquitted the accused persons namely (i) Mustkim Khan S/o Sh.
