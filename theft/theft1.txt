Nochange in the terms & conditions is allowed this scheme.As such, your request for extension, for a period of 8 to 9 months to make payment ofpart of residual amount i.e. `2.52 Crores cannot be considered.

Later , on 09.10.2018, interimorder was directed to continue.The matter underwent subsequent adjournments on 20.11.2018, 15.01.2019, and on 21.02.2019,petitioner was directed to deposit a further sum of `50 Lakhs to show the petitioner's bona fides.This direction was also complied with by the petitioner on 24.6.2019, leaving only balance of `2.02Crores to be paid towards the OTS.It is contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is entitled for the extension oftime for complying with the OTS CWP No.327 of 2020 P & H (DB) DT.23.12.2020 CM-1375-2021 INRA-CW-22-2021 IN CWP-20520-2019 DT.29.1.2021 CWP-6809-2021-P&H DT.10.12.20212013(1)PLR 688 P&H (DB) CWP No.4348 of 2012 P&H (DB) 2015(67) R.C.R (Civil) 782 P &H (DB)2008(1) ISJ (Banking) 248 P&H (DB) AIR 2007 SC 1689 6 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) asthe petitioner fulfills the guidelines laid down in the case of Anu Bhalla (1 Supra) and othersjudgments referred to above.Counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner will deposit the balance due of `2.02 Croreswith the applicable interest also if the petitioner is given time of two months from today to do so.Contentions of Counsel for the Respondent Bank In it's written reply, the respondent-Bank deniedthat the petitioner's business suffered on account of recession or global economic meltdown andstated that the similarly placed business entities had done roaring business. It was pointed out thatthe petitioner's loan account was rightly declared as NPA on 02.03.2015, and action under the Actwas rightly initiated against the petitioner.It is contended that a Circular/Policy dt.01.09.2017 was issued by the respondent-Bank, floating anOTS scheme for the NPA accounts with outstanding amount of `20 Lakhs and upto `25 Crores as on31.03.2017, and the said scheme was non-discretionary and non- discriminatory.It is admitted that on the basis of the said policy, a letter dt.11.09.2017 was issued offering OTS tothe petitioner.It is contended that once outstanding amount payable by the petitioner had been crystallized onacceptance of the OTS proposal vide letter dt.21.11.2017, question of seeking any concessionArvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/4subsequently by the petitioner from the respondent-Bank does not arise.7 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) It is contended that the petitioner is making an attempt towriggle out of the agreed OTS; and that `6,02,31,301/- was required to be deposited on or before21.05.2018, but the said amount was not deposited.According to the respondent, an amount of `3.50 Crores was deposited on 22.05.2018, and there isstill balance `2.52 Crores out of the total OTS amount.It is contended that the OTS arrived at between the petitioner and the respondent-Bank came to anend on account of non-payment of the entire OTS amount by 21.05.2018, and the respondent-Bankbecame entitled to claim the total outstanding amount along with upto date interest and charges.It is denied that no prejudice would be caused to the respondent-Bank if the period of repayment ofthe remaining amount is extended to 8-9 months.It is pointed out that the OTS Scheme dt.01.09.2017 was for a fixed period with an object ofgarnering funds from the stressed accounts within a short period of time, and certain benefits &incentives were extended to the borrower with underlying objectives of the respondent- Bank forrecovery of substantial amount within a short period of time. It is contended that the outstanding ason 31.03.2017 was `13,99,89,273.99 excluding the accrued interest from the date of NPA and othercharges, but the account was agreed to be settled for smaller amount of `10,53,75,069.74, and thus,the respondent-Bank had sacrificed a huge amount to recover the remaining outstanding amountwithin the shortest period of time.8 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) It is contended that if the period for payment of the OTSamount or part thereof is extended, as sought by the petitioner, the objective sought to be achievedby way of the OTS, would be defeated.The respondent-Bank also to justified its decision contained in the letter dt.16.05.2018 rejecting therequest of the petitioner for extending the time for complying with the OTS.Counsel for the respondent-Bank reiterated the above submissions and placed reliance on thefollowing judgments:-Bijnor Urban Cooperative Bank Ltd. Vs. Meenal Aggarwal10 Asokan Vasu Vs. StateBank of India11 V.K. Milk Chilling Centre Vs. Punjab Financial Corporation Bank12Digivision Electronics Ltd. Vs. Indian Bank13 Vipin Kumar Gupta Vs.

State Bank of India17 The consideration by theCourt First we shall consider the question:Arvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/5"Whether an OTS scheme can be extended by the High Court and if so, in whatcircumstances?"This issue had been considered by a coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Anu Bhalla andAnother (1 supra) .Civil Appeal No.7411 of 2021 dt.15.2.2021 (SC) 2020 SCC Online Ker 4282 (2007) 4 BC 474 (2005)3 CTC 513 AIR 2004 ALL 319 (2005) 1 LW 58 AIR 2002 ALL 96 2006(2) AD (Delhi) 167 9 of 23CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) In that the case, the Division Bench specifically held that in exerciseof the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Courts would have thejurisdiction to extend the period of settlement as originally provided for in OTS letter, but laid downcertain guidelines to be followed.It held that One Time Settlement is not cloaked with rigorous principles which may not permitextension of period to pay the remaining / balance settlement amount; and in fact OTS policies ofcertain Banks themselves contain provisions for extension for the time period in their respectivesettlement Policies.Once this is so, the Bench held that there is no reason to hold that the Courts, in exercise of theirequitable jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, cannot extend such time periodof settlement.It held that the willful defaulters and fraudsters would not be entitled to such extension, and in thecase of a deserving borrower, who has deposited substantial amount within the original stipulatedperiod of settlement, and proved his bona fides, and is willing to clear the remaining amount in areasonable period and also compensate the creditor with interest for the period of delay, the Courtcan consider extending the period with some flexibility to achieve the ultimate aim of suchsettlement.It laid down certain illustrative guidelines which are required to be considered cumulatively orindividually on case to case basis to decide whether in a given case an applicant would be entitled forthe extension of OTS.10 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) They are as under:-A. The original time provided in the Settlement:-If the time period originally stipulated in the settlement letter to pay off thesettlement amount is short or is not excessive, the case for extension could beconsidered, and reasonable time must be given to the borrower to arrange the fundsto clear off the OTS.B. Extent of payments already deposited under the settlement or before filing of the petition:-Arvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/6If the borrower has already paid substantial amounts to the creditor under the OTS, and for someremaining amounts, is seeking a reasonable extension, such request can be considered favourably.C. Reasons which led to delay in payment -If the borrower was prevented by certain reasons or circumstances beyond his control, it could be areason to consider an extension favourably. It would be imperative for the borrower to show, that hemade his best efforts to ensure that the requisite amounts are arranged within the specified time,but in spite of all his best efforts, he could not arrange for the same.D. Payments having been accepted by the Bank/Financial Institution, after the stipulated date:-If some payments were accepted by the Bank even after the stipulated period of time, it would showthat the time was not the essence of contract, and it would be apparent from such conduct, thatcertain amount of relaxation or flexibility in making the payment of OTS amount is reservedbetween the parties.11 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) E. Bona fide Intent of the borrower to pay the remainingamounts under the settlement -The bonafide intention of such an applicant could reasonably be tested by asking such an applicantto deposit some further amount, towards the balance amount before calling upon the bank toconsider the issue of extension. If such amounts are deposited under the orders of Court and thebonafides are established, such an applicant would be entitled for a favourable consideration of anapplication for extension.F. Time period being demanded by the applicant to clear the remaining / balance settlementamount.An applicant whose intention would be to clear the balance settlement amounts, would not claim anunreasonable period of time extension, as otherwise, the intention would be to gain more time,without any actual intent to clear the settlement. In the facts and circumstances of each case, theCourts would therefore determine a reasonable period, to enable the borrower to clear theremaining settlement amount, subject of course, to payment of reasonable interest for the delayedperiod, to balance the equities.G. Attending factors and circumstances-Illustrations of such factors could be the situation created by COVID-19 pandemic, and thedifficulties in arranging the amounts could be taken note of while determining the period ofextension to be granted to an applicant. Likewise, losses suffered on account of natural calamities,unfortunate accidents, fire incidents, thefts, 12 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) damage byfloods, storms etc. could also be the factors to be taken into account for extension of time.Arvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/7H. Irreparable loss and injury to the applicant The Division Bench in Anu Bhalla (1 Supra) clarifiedthat the guidelines/factors are not exhaustive but only illustrative for the guidance of the parties andthe Courts, while considering the prayer by the borrower for extension of the time under OTS oncase to case basis. It also held that the Courts would be free to consider the credentials of theborrower as well, being an equitable and discretionary relief.Several decisions rendered by different High Courts and Supreme Court were considered by the saidDivision Bench while rendering the above judgment.Therefore, the contention of the respondent-Bank that in no circumstance can the Court grantextension of time for completion of the payment under the OTS, cannot be countenanced. Such apower undoubtedly exists, though not as a matter of right, and must be exercised by a High Courtkeeping in mind the above guidelines/principles.Counsel for the respondent-Bank, however, sought to contend that the said judgment deals withonly cases of settlement other than under the OTS scheme, and would have no application tosettlement entered into under the OTS scheme, and sought to distinguish Anu Bhalla (1 Supra).We may point out that in Anu Bhalla (1 Supra), the Court had framed the specific issue in Para 14"as to whether this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution ofIndia, has the jurisdiction to extend the period of OTS", and then said Bench answered 13 of 23 CWPNo.12953 of 2018 (O&M) the said issue in Para No.24 in the affirmative. Therefore, we reject thiscontention of the counsel for the respondent-Bank.Counsel for the respondent-Bank then sought to contend that the Hon'ble Supreme Court recentlyin the case of Bijnor Urban Cooperative Bank (10 Supra) had taken a view that the High Court underArticle 226 of the Constitution of India cannot direct a Bank to positively consider or grant benefit ofOTS to a borrower, and therefore, even extension of time to comply with the OTS, cannot be grantedto a borrower by this Court.We may point out that in the case of Bijnor Urban Cooperative Bank (10 Supra), the Supreme Courtwas not concerned with the question of extension of time to comply with an OTS already sanctionedto a borrower by a Bank. It was dealing with the case of non- grant of OTS scheme benefit to aborrower. Therefore, the said decision has no application to the instant case.In fact, the judgment in Bijnore Urban Cooperative Bank (10 Supra) had not taken note of thedecision of the Supreme Court in the case of Sardar Associates Vs. Punjab and Sind Bank18 whichhad taken a diametrically opposite view.In Sardar Associates ( 18 Supra), a borrower of Punjab and Sind Bank , in terms of RBI guidelinesfor OTS offred a particular sum, but the Bank demanded more from the borrower as it had bettersecurity available with it , and defended it's decision saying that it was a policy decision of it's Board.The Supreme Court rejected the said plea.Arvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/82009 (8) SCC 257 14 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) The Supreme Court in Sardar Associates(18 Supra) held that the Reserve Bank of India is a statutory authority, that it exercises supervisorypower in the matter of functioning of the Scheduled Banks, and that matters relating to supervisionof the Scheduled Banks is also governed by the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. It held thatguidelines have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India through a letter dt.03.09.2005 addressedto the Chairman/Managing Director of all Public Sector Banks; that the said letter refers to circulardt.19.08.2005 issued by the Reserve Bank of India; in terms of the said circular, guidelines for grantof OTS scheme for recovery NPAs below `10 crore were laid down; and the letter dt.03.09.2005categorically stated that such OTS scheme had to be implemented by all Public Sector Banks and theguidelines were non- discretionary and non-discriminatory in SME Sector.It held that the Public Sector Banks have to implement the guidelines of the RBI relating to the OTSas per it's decision in Central Bank of India v. Ravindra19, that the Board of Directors of the Bank inthe said case could not have deviated from the said guidelines, and it's conduct was violative of theequality Clause contained in the RBI guidelines and also Article 14 of the Constitution of India.It held that the Bank itself had made an offer to accept the proposal of the appellant in regard toenforcement of OTS pursuant to the RBI guidelines, and it was certainly aware of the amount ofsecurities lying with it. It declared that if in terms of the guidelines issued by the RBI, a right iscreated in a borrower, even a writ of Mandamus can be issued.2002 (1) SCC 367 15 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) In the decision of the Full Bench of thisCourt in the case of M/s Indo Swiss Time Ltd. Vs. Umarao and Others20 , it was held that if there isdirect conflict between the decisions of the Supreme Court rendered by two equal Benches, the HighCourt must follow the judgment which appears to lay down the law more elaborately and moreaccurately; and that mere incidence of time-whether judgement is earlier or later, could hardly berelevant.We are of the view that in the case of Sardar Associates (18 Supra) the Court had elaboratelyconsidered the issue of grant of OTS rather than in case of Bijnore Urban Cooperative Bank ( 10Supra) and the decision in Sardar Associates ( 18 Supra) was not noticed by the Supreme Court inthe Bijnore Urban Cooperative Bank (10 Supra) case. So we prefer to follow the decision in SardarAssociates ( 18 Supra) and hold that it would not be open to a Bank to decline OTS sought by aborrower, provided he falls within the OTS policy being followed by the said Bank.We also hold that the decision in the case of Bijnor Urban Cooperative Bank (10 Supra) cannot beinterpreted to the effect that in all circumstances the High Court is helpless to extend the OTSscheme offered by a schedule Bank, since the said issue did not arise for consideration in that case.Though, decisions of other High Courts referred to above were cited by the counsel for therespondent-Bank supporting his contentions, having regard to the decision in the case of Anu Bhalla(1 Supra) of this very High Court, which is binding on this Bench, we reject the contentions of therespondent-Bank that this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution AIR 1981 Punjab 213 16 of 23CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) of India has no power for grant extension of OTS to a borrowerArvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/9under any circumstances.So this issue is answered in favor of the petitioner. Now we shall consider the question:"whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is permissible for this Court to grant to thepetitioner extension of time for the payment of the balance amount of the OTS with interest ?"There is no dispute in the instant case that the respondent-Bank vide letter dt.11.08.2007 offered anOTS to the petitioner of `10,53,75,069.74, requiring the petitioner to pay 10% of the ledger amountalongwith application, 25% of the OTS amount within one month from the date of sanction, andremaining 75% within six months from the date of sanction.The petitioner agreed to it vide its letter dt.31.10.2017 by depositing `1.4 Crores and submitted itsoffer for settlement.On 21.11.2017, the respondent-Bank sanctioned the OTS proposal and required the petitioner todeposit 25% of the OTS amount of `2,63,43,768/- by 21.12.2017, and stated that the balance amountcan be paid within six months from the date of the said letter i.e. 21.05.2018 vis-à-vis interest MCLRwith 2% failing which the OTS would be rendered infructuous.The petitioner deposited a sum of `1,23,45,000/- by 30.12.2017 which was confirmed by therespondent-Bank vide letter dt.09.01.2018. The petitioner paid `1.88 Crores till 16.03.2018.17 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) Thus, `4.52 Crores had been paid by the petitioner leaving abalance of `6.02 Crores payable by 21.05.2018.Vide Annexure P-2 letter dt.10.05.2018, the petitioner promised to pay `3.50 Crores by 21.05.2018and requested 8-9 months' time to pay balance of `2.52 Crores due to difficulty arising out of itsinability to sell properties and make arrangements to raise funds.According to the petitioner `3.50 Crores was deposited for payment on 21.05.2018, but therespondent-Bank gave credit to the said amount only on the next day i.e. 22.05.2018.Even assuming that the respondent-Bank is right regarding the date of payment, 24 hours' delay insuch payment cannot be considered to be a very serious violation of the commitment made by thepetitioner in its letter dt.10.05.2018.Thus, what remained to be paid was `2.52 Crores (20% of the OTS), and `8.02 Crores had beenreceived by the respondent-Bank being 80% of the OTS amount sanctioned by it to the petitioner.It is also not in dispute that after filing of this Writ Petition, there was a direction by this Court on21.02.2019 to the petitioner to deposit `50 Lakhs before the next date of hearing on 25.03.2019, andthe petitioner paid the said amount on 24.06.2019 with a delay of 3 months. Thus, what remained ofthe OTS as of date is a sum of `2 Crores.Arvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/10During the subsequent period, though the Writ Petition was listed on 25.07.2019, 05.08.2019,24.10.2019, 22.11.2019, 19.04.2021, 29.04.2021, 18.08.2021, 27.10.2021, 13.12.2021, 01.02.2022and 15.02.2022, the arguments were concluded only on 02.03.2022. It appears 18 of 23 CWPNo.12953 of 2018 (O&M) that the matter was not listed in the year 2020 at all on account of theCOVID-19 pandemic and also on account of restricted listing of cases in the year 2021 for the samereason, and the matter was also adjourned sometimes thereafter at the request of counsel for thepetitioner and other times at the request of counsel for the respondent-Bank.It is the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that if two months time is granted to thepetitioner, the petitioner would pay with interest the balance the balance OTS amount of `2 Croresas per the sanction letter issued on 21.11.2017.It is no doubt true that the petitioner had sought extension of time - only 8-9 months for payment ofOTS amount in the letter dt.10.05.2018 addressed by it to the respondent-Bank, but the same hadbeen rejected by the respondents vide impugned order dt.16.05.2018.The mere fact that the said 8-9 months' time sought by the petitioner had expired by now, cannot bea ground, in our opinion, to hold that the OTS extension should now be denied to the petitioner.Had the respondent-Bank agreed to the said request at that point of time, or if it had granted even alesser amount of time, it is probable that the petitioner might have paid the balance of `2.00 Croreswith the applicable interest.The delay in disposal of the Writ Petition cannot be put against the petitioner since it is a settled lawthat actions or inactions of the Court cannot prejudice any party; and time taken in legalproceedings cannot be put against a party.19 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) In Essar Steel India Ltd. Committee of Creditors v. SatishKumar Gupta21, the Supreme Court declared:"124. Given the fact that timely resolution of stressed assets is a key factor in the successful workingof the Code, the only real argument against the amendment is that the time taken in legalproceedings cannot ever be put against the parties before NCLT and NCLAT based upon a Latinmaxim which subserves the cause of justice, namely, actus curiae neminem gravabit.125. In Atma Ram Mittal v. Ishwar Singh 22, this Court applied the maxim to time taken in legalproceedings under the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, holding: (SCC pp.288-89, para 8) "8. It is well settled that no man should suffer because of the fault of the court ordelay in the procedure. Broom has stated the maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit-- an act of court shall prejudice no man. Therefore, having regard to the time normally consumedfor adjudication, the ten years' exemption or holiday from the application of the Rent Act wouldbecome illusory, if the suit has to be filed within that time and be disposed of finally. It is commonknowledge that unless a suit is instituted soon after the date of letting it would never be disposed ofArvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/11within ten years and even then within that time it may not be disposed of. That will make the tenyears holiday from the Rent Act illusory and provide no incentive to the landlords to build newhouses to solve problem of shortages of houses. The purpose of legislation would thus be defeated.Purposive interpretation in a social amelioration legislation is an imperative irrespective of anythingelse."127. ... ... Given the fact that the time taken in legal proceedings cannot possibly harm a litigant if theTribunal itself cannot take up the litigant's case within the requisite period for no fault of thelitigant, a provision which mandatorily requires the CIRP to end by a certain date -- without anyexception thereto -- may well be an excessive interference with a litigant's fundamental right tonon-arbitrary treatment under Article 14 and an excessive, arbitrary and therefore unreasonablerestriction on a litigant's fundamental right to carry on business under Article 19(1)(g) of theConstitution of India. This being the case, we would ordinarily have struck down the provision in itsentirety. However, that would then throw the baby out with the bath water, inasmuch as the timetaken in legal proceedings is certainly an important factor which causes delay, and which has madeprevious statutory experiments fail as we have seen from Madras Petrochem31. Thus, while leavingthe provision otherwise intact, we strike down the word "mandatorily" as being manifestly (2020) 8SCC 531, at page 626 1988 (4) SCC 284 20 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) arbitrary underArticle 14 of the Constitution of India and as being an excessive and unreasonable restriction on thelitigant's right to carry on business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The effect of thisdeclaration is that ordinarily the time taken in relation to the corporate resolution process of thecorporate debtor must be completed within the outer limit of 330 days from the insolvencycommencement date, including extensions and the time taken in legal proceedings. However, on thefacts of a given case, if it can be shown to the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunalunder the Code that only a short period is left for completion of the insolvency resolution processbeyond 330 days, and that it would be in the interest of all stakeholders that the corporate debtor beput back on its feet instead of being sent into liquidation and that the time taken in legalproceedings is largely due to factors owing to which the fault cannot be ascribed to the litigantsbefore the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal, the delay or a large part thereof beingattributable to the tardy process of the Adjudicating Authority and/or the Appellate Tribunal itself,it may be open in such cases for the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal to extendtime beyond 330 days. Likewise, even under the newly added proviso to Section 12, if by reason ofall the aforesaid factors the grace period of 90 days from the date of commencement of theAmending Act of 2019 is exceeded, there again a discretion can be exercised by the AdjudicatingAuthority and/or Appellate Tribunal to further extend time keeping the aforesaid parameters inmind. It is only in such exceptional cases that time can be extended, the general rule being that 330days is the outer limit within which resolution of the stressed assets of the corporate debtor musttake place beyond which the corporate debtor is to be driven into liquidation." ( emphasis supplied)It is stated in the rejection letter dt.16.05.2018 that the OTS scheme was non-discriminatory andnon-discretionary; and that the terms and conditions of the scheme are applicable uniformally to allthe eligible borrowers; and that no change in the terms and conditions is allowed under this scheme.Much emphasis has been laid on the terms "non-discretionary" and "non-discriminatory" by thecounsel for the respondent-Bank, and it is contended that if the petitioner was granted anyArvindra Electronics Pvt. Ltd vs State Bank Of India on 10 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95142803/12extension by the Bank, other borrowers might also seek it.21 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) In Anu Bhalla (1 Supra), this Court had referred to grant ofextensions of OTS by public sector Banks such as Punjab National Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank; andeven the State Bank of India (respondent herein) which had settled their accounts under the OTS byname SBI-OTS-2019, by extending the last date of deposit of settlement from 31.03.2020 to30.06.2020 and then to 30.09.2020, when the Country was effected by COVID-19 pandemic.So we do not agree that the deadline fixed in the OTS sanction letter is sacrosanct and cannot beextended by the Bank for any reason whatsoever.Accordingly we set aside the rejection letter Annexure P1 dt.16.5.2018 issued by the respondentrefusing to grant time to petitioner to comply with the terms of the OTS.We shall now see whether the petitioner fulfills conditions laid down in the case of Anu Bhalla (1Supra) for granting extension of OTS.Admittedly, the petitioner had already paid 80% of the OTS amount by the last date fixed under theOTS i.e. 21.05.2018, and only `2.52 Crores were left to be paid.As per the sanctioned OTS, the petitioner had to raise more than `10 Crores in six months between21.11.2017 and 21.05.2018, and such a large amount of money is difficult to arrange in such a shorttime; and yet by making best efforts, the petitioner had made 80% payment of the OTS amount by21.05.2018, and was only seeking a reasonable extension to pay the balance of `2.52 Crores and ithad exhibited an intention to clear the settlement amount. The reasons assigned by the petitionerfor the delay 22 of 23 CWP No.12953 of 2018 (O&M) in payment was the difficulty in selling thesecured assets/properties for a decent price, which cannot be dismissed as false outright; thepetitioner did make efforts to sell the same which is also admitted by the respondent- Bank; thebona fides of the petitioner is also established by the payment of `50 Lakhs after filing of the WritPetition; the time period demanded by the petitioner to clear the balance amount is a mere twomonths; and the COVID-19 pandemic's deleterious effect on businesses during the period 2020 to2021 is also to be taken into account.So we are of the opinion that for the aforesaid reasons, this is a fit case to grant to the petitionerextension of time for a reasonable time and compensate the Bank by payment of interest for thesame.Accordingly, the Writ Petition is allowed; the rejection letter Annexure P1 dt.16.5.2018 is set aside;and the petitioner is granted 6 weeks time from today to make the payment of `2.02 Crores withinterest as per the sanction letter of the OTS dt.21.09.2017. The respondent-Bank shall intimate thepetitioner the amount of interest payable by the petitioner within one week from the date of receiptof the certified copy of this order.Arvindra Electronics Pvt.
