It has been argued that having been unsuccessful in getting an FIR registeredfor the commission of offences of cheating and forgery and having found that a cancellation reporthas been submitted in that FIR, respondent no.2 shifted his base to Haryana from Delhi and filedMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/8complaint no.4(first complaint in Haryana) on 12.03.2019 (Annexure P-20 Page 471) before theGovernor of Haryana with a copy to the Health Minister of Haryana, Lokayukta Chandigarh,Additional Chief Secretary Haryana and the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. It has been stated thateven in the said complaint, allegations with respect to the alleged illegalities committed during thebid process for the tender floated by the Haryana State Health Resource Centre (HSHRC) forimplementation of hospital information system were made and additionally, in the said complaintallegations of corruption were also levelled. It has been stated in the said complaint that although,FIR no.419/2017 had been registered in pursuance of the order of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,Rohini Courts but it was not mentioned in Complaint-4 that allegations with respect to cheating andforgery had already been made in the earlier complaint (Complaint-3) and on the said aspect, theFIR on the said sections had not been registered. It has been submitted that respondent no.2 hadeven filed a CRM-M-54124- 2019 before the High Court for seeking directions for registration of FIRon similar allegations but as is apparent from the order dated 18.12.2019, the same was dismissed aswithdrawn as the counsel for the petitioner therein (respondent no.2 herein), after arguing for sometime, had stated that he wanted to withdraw the said petition with liberty to file an appropriatepetition before the concerned Lokayukta. It has been argued that a coordinate Bench of this Courthad not found the case to be a fit case for 13 of 153 direction of registration of FIR nor had found thecase fit for reference to the Lokayukta and therefore, the counsel for respondent no.2 (petitionertherein) had withdrawn the petition to seek the alternative remedy and the said order does not inany way further the case of respondent no.2 and rather shows that coordinate Bench of this Courtwas not inclined to register an FIR against the present petitioners. Respondent no.2 then filed acomplaint (Complaint-5) before Lokayukta Haryana and in the said complaint(Complaint-5) inaddition to the seven petitioners, 17 government officials who had approved the tender were alsoarrayed as parties. In the said complaint, all the allegations which are sought to be leveled in thepresent complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., were made in addition to allegations of corruptionas well as the alleged loss caused to the Haryana Government. A prayer had been made inComplaint-5 for inquiry into the matter and for registration of an FIR. It has been stated that thesaid complaint is still pending and thus, initiation of the present proceedings and registration of thepresent FIR simultaneously, is violative of Article 21 of the constitution of India and is incontravention of the principles of double jeopardy. The Health Department had forwarded the saidcomplaint (Complaint-5), vide letter dated 08.03.2020, to the Haryana State ElectronicsDevelopment Corporation Limited (in short "HARTRON") for examining the whole matter. Videreport dated 22.07.2020, the said HARTRON considered the entire matter and had finally maderecommendations, which have been detailed at Page 501 of the paper book. It has been submittedthat in the impugned order, a portion of the said report has been taken note of by the learned ChiefJudicial Magistrate, Panchkula but the ultimate conclusion / recommendations, which are at page501 of the paper book, have not been noted. It has been argued that even as per the said report, itwas 14 of 153 recommended that the company secretary / chartered accountant may be consultedand ultimately recommended that a new committee be constituted which should include membersfrom HSHRC, NISG, Health Department, Hartron, DITECH, ISMO and NIC for an in-depth study ofall the documents, including the complaint and to give their expert views. It has been stated that inpursuance of the said recommendations, the Committee was actually constituted and the committeehad submitted its report dated 12.01.2021 Annexure P-23 (Page 503) and after considering all theaspects and on the basis of the report of all the members and the points discussed, it was stated thatMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/9Haryana Government should not be made a party to the dispute between employer and ex-employeeand the complaint was recommended to be filed. It has also been pointed out that Prabhjot Singhwas the Chairperson of the said committee and there were as many as 11 persons in the committee,which also included respondents no.3 and 4 and the said report had been submitted after dueconsideration of all the said officers/ persons. It is stated that in the impugned order, interim reportdated 22.07.2020 had been considered whereas, the final report had not been taken intoconsideration in spite of the fact that, as is apparent from the zimni orders which have been placedon record, the entire record was called for. It has been further pointed out that a perusal of theimpugned order would show that the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula had stated that he hadtaken "cognizance" of the said report and was proceeding further and had also observed thatrespondents no.3 and 4 have been made complainants in the present case in place of respondentno.2, who had initially filed the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. Learned senior counsel forthe petitioners have pointed out that there was another complaint (Complaint-6) dated 11.02.2020Annexure P-24 (Page 508) which was filed by respondent 15 of 153 no.2 to the Director General ofPolice, Haryana under Sections 406, 409, 419, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC and also underSection 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and it had been prayed in Complaint-6 that aninquiry be conducted against the petitioners as well as the delinquent and erring officials of theHaryana State Health Resource Centre, Government of Haryana and criminal case/FIR beregistered against them. It has been argued by the Learned Senior Counsel that even the said matterwas enquired into and after the initial report dated 01.09.2020, the final report dated 19.10.2020was submitted by the Police Commissioner, Panchkula, who had stated that according to the adviceof the Deputy District Attorney, Panchkula, it was recommended that the said complaint be sent tothe record room. It has been pointed out that in the impugned order the interim report dated01.09.2020 has been relied upon whereas, the said report had merged with the report dated19.10.2020. It has further been pointed out that respondent no.2 again approached this Court byfiling CRM-M-4551-2021, with a prayer for directing the registration of an FIR against thepetitioners and the same was dismissed as withdrawn on the submission of the counsel appearingfor petitioner therein (respondent no.2) since he did not press the petition and sought liberty to filea criminal complaint and the same was granted by a Coordinate Bench of this Court. It has beenargued that it was stated before the Coordinate Bench of this Court that there is a police report dated01.09.2020 without informing the Court that said report had merged with the report dated19.10.2020. Even the report/letter dated 12.01.2021 (Annexure P-23) was also not brought to thenotice of the Court. It has been contended that the petition was not entertained and it waswithdrawn and no direction was given to register an FIR or initiate any proceedings in the matter. Ithas also been pointed out 16 of 153 that in the said order liberty was sought to file a criminalcomplaint but respondent no.2 has chosen to file an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. beforethe Magistrate, Panchkula on the basis of which the impugned order has been passed and theimpugned FIR has been registered. Detailed reference has been made to the averments made in theapplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. It has been pointed out that the 17 government officialsagainst who were arrayed as proposed accused persons and against whom allegations of corruptionhad been levelled in Complaint-5 (Lokayukta Application/Complaint), have not been arrayed asparties in the present complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. since respondent no.2 was well awarethat prior sanction to prosecute them under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 would berequired. It has also been pointed out that Monishankar Hazra and Sameer Bansal i.e., theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/10petitioners in CRM-M- 6692-2022, who were never made accused in any of the complaints or evenin the proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in Rohini Courts, Delhi, have been impleaded asaccused no.9 and 10 in the present complaint. It has been submitted that there is active concealmentin the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. inasmuch as, there is no reference to respondentno.2 having filed an earlier application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the Rohini Courts nor ithas been stated that similar allegations with respect to forgery, cheating and corruption had alreadybeen made in the said application and it has surreptitiously been mentioned in para 28 of thepresent Complaint (Complaint-7) (Page 547) that FIR no.419/2017 has been registered underSections 66/66-C of the IT Act, however, the fact that cancellation report had been submitted in thesaid case, has not been mentioned. No reference had been to complaint dated 05.09.2016(Complaint-1)Annexure P-12, dated 24.02.2017 Annexure P-14. A 17 of 153 reference has been madeto para 42 of the present petition to show that it has been stated in the complaint that no such orsimilar petition except the present application as has been mentioned in the petition, has been filedor pending or decided by this Hon'ble Court or the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court orHon'ble Supreme Court of India or in any court of law. It has been submitted that the proceedingswith respect to cancellation report of the FIR no.419/2017 are pending for 01.04.2022 and thus, theabove statement is incorrect and the said facts constitute active concealment on the part ofRespondent no.2 and that the present petitions deserve to be allowed on the said ground alone. Ithas also been pointed out that although, all the government officials have been left out and not beenarrayed as accused persons but the present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. still mentionsoffence under Section 409 IPC. It has been highlighted in para 5 of the Complaint that respondentno.2 is not a signatory of any material and the said assertion is even contrary to the observationsmade in the impugned order to the effect that respondent no.2 had participated in the entire biddingprocess and was thus, deleted as the complainant in the present case. It has been submitted thatalthough allegations have been levelled to the effect that there is a loss of Rs.60 crores to the stateexchequer but it has been highlighted that there were other bidders who had also participated in thetender process and filed their respective bids but none of the said persons have challenged thetender process. It has been highlighted that in para 26 it has been stated that on 01.10.2015,respondent no.2 came to know about the whole scam from accused no.2-Sandeep Khurana, who in adrunken state had informed respondent no.2 about the entire incident and yet the presentcomplaint has been filed after a delay of more than 5 years and 9 months and for the same, referencehas been made 18 of 153 to para 39. Further, it has been argued that in para 41 it has been statedthat the jurisdiction is of the Panchkula Courts whereas, in the earlier complaint under Section156(3) Cr.P.C. (Complaint-3),it had been stated that since the entire occurrence had taken place inDelhi, it was the Delhi Court that had jurisdiction and on the basis of the same, learned seniorcounsel for the petitioners have submitted that the averments in the two applications under Section156(3) Cr.P.C.(i.e., Complaint-3 and Complaint-7) are contrary to each other.6. In order to substantiate the said ground, learned senior counsel for the petitioners have furtherrelied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Krishna Lal Chawla and othervs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another, reported as (2021) 5 Supreme Court Cases 435, T.T. Antonyvs. State of Kerela reported as 2001(6) SCC 181 and Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah vs. Central Bureauof Investigation and Anr. reported as 2013(6) SCC 348 and also the judgment of this Court dated07.01.2022 passed in CRM-M-45411-2021 titled as "Gurmail Singh Vs. State of Punjab andMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/11another".7. Ground no.(2):It has been vehemently argued that a perusal of the entire complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.would show that neither any complaint has been made to the Station House Officer nor to the SeniorSuperintendent of Police, as is mandatory under Section 154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C. and thus, thepresent complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. deserves to be outrightly rejected being incontravention to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava'scase (supra). Specific reference has been made to para 31 of the judgment wherein it has beenmandated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that a 19 of 153 prior application under Section154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C. before filing application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. had to be filed andthe facts detailing the same had to be clearly spelt out in the application under Section 156 (3)Cr.P.C. and necessary documents to the said effect are also required to be filed. It has beenhighlighted by learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the law laid down in PriyankaSrivastava's case (supra) has been followed in Criminal Appeal no.252 of 2022 titled as BabuVenkatesh and others vs. State of Karnataka and another, decided on 18.02.2022. In the presentcase it is submitted that neither any averment with respect to respondent no.2 having filed the saidapplications under Sections 154(1) or 154(3) has been made nor any such document has been filedalongwith the same. The impugned order is also sought to be challenged being in contravention tothe law laid down in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra). It has been pointed out that as per para 35of the said judgment, the judgment was ordered to be circulated to all the judicial officers and thesaid judgment is dated 19.03.2015, which is prior to the passing of impugned order.8. Ground no.(3):It has been contended that in the present case, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula hasembarked upon a procedure which is unknown to law. In order to substantiate the said argument,reference has been made to the reply filed by respondent no.2,particularly, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 tohighlight that in the reply it had been stated that over a span of 3 months, the Chief JudicialMagistrate, Panchkula, had conducted his own inquiry and also called for the record in a sealedcover and even the counsel for respondent no. 2 had no access to the said sealed cover as thepermission to inspect the record by counsel for the complainant/respondent no.2, was declined bythe Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula, and the Court 20 of 153 after satisfying itself, hadpassed the impugned order. Reference has been made to the zimni orders which have been annexedalong with the short reply submitted by Respondent no.2. It has been contended that initially astatus report was called from the SHO and thereafter, as is apparent from the zimni orders dated17.09.2021 and 05.10.2021, the documents with respect to the inquiry from the M.D., HaryanaMedical Services Corporation, Haryana, have been called for in exercise of powers under Section 91Cr.P.C. and it was directed that the complete record be summoned in a sealed cover from the ChiefVigilance Officer of Health Department, after having found that the case stood transferred to theChief Vigilance Officer of Health Department. A similar direction was given to the Director GeneralHealth Services Haryana while exercising power under Section 91 Cr.P.C., as is apparent from thezimni order dated 20.10.2021 when the sealed report was received in the case. It has been submittedMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/12that after considering the entire record, the Chief Judicial Magistrate had recorded in para 8 of theimpugned Order that the Court took cognizance on the report filed by the Assistant GeneralManager, HARTRON (respondents no.3 and 4 herein) dated 22.07.2020 and thereafter, replacedrespondent no.2 with respondents no.3 and 4 as complainants in the present case, as is apparentfrom the impugned FIR. It has been submitted that above-said facts would show that instead ofexercising powers under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., which empowers the Magistrate to direct theregistration of an FIR in an appropriate case, the Chief Judicial Magistrate had embarked upon anenquiry himself, by issuing summons under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and has thus, moved from ChapterXII Cr.P.C. to Chapter XV Cr.P.C. and having done so, power under Chapter XII for registration ofan FIR could not have legally been exercised while considering the application under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. Reference has been 21 of 153 made to various provisions under Chapter XII and Chapter XIVwith respect to the abovesaid argument, reliance has been placed upon the judgments of Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in S.K.Sinha, Chief Enforcement Officer vs. Videocon International Limitedand others, reported as 2008(2) SCC 492; Mohd.Yousuf vs. Afaq Jahan (SMT) and another,reported as 2006(1) SCC 627, Ramdev Foods Product Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Gujarat, reported as2015(6) SCC 439, Madhav and another vs. State of Maharashtra and another, reported as 2013 (5)SCC 615, Supreme Bhinondi Wada Monor Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra andanother, reported as 2021 (8) SCC 753.9. It has further been pointed out that even alongwith the short reply, respondent no.2 has annexedAnnexure R2/7, which is a revision petition that has been filed by respondent no.2 challenging theimpugned order and it is stated to be pending before the Sessions Judge, Panchkula. A perusal of thegrounds of the said revision would show that although, respondent no.2 has projected himself to bethe whistleblower but the very fact that even after the registration of the FIR, the impugned order issought to be challenged by respondent no.2 would show that the entire proceedings have beeninitiated with a malafide motive to extract money from the petitioners. To buttress the saidargument, reliance has been placed upon the judgment dated 07.06.2021 of Single Bench of HighCourt of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur passed in Writ Petition (Cr.) No.678 of 2020 titled as "RajeshwarSharma vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others".10. Ground no. 4:Learned senior counsel for the petitioners have stated that in the present case even if the allegationsin the FIR are taken on its face value then also, no offence of forgery and cheating or even offencesunder Section 406 22 of 153 and 409 IPC are made out. It has been argued that the allegations offorgery have been primarily been made by referring to the experience certificates which are stated tobe annexed along with the application under Section 156(3) as Annexures C-9 and C-10 and that it isnot the case of respondent no.2 or of the prosecution that the signatures of any person have beenforged on the same or any of the ingredients of Section 464 as detailed in the judgment of Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in Md. Ibrahim's case (supra) are made out and thus, the said documentscannot be stated to be a false documents within the meaning of Section 464 IPC which is a necessaryingredient to constitute the offence of forgery. It is further argued that the judgment of the Hon'bleSupreme Court in Md. Ibrahim's case (supra) has been followed in Sheila Sebastian's case (supra). Ithas further been submitted that even the allegations with respect to the balance sheets, areMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/13absolutely false and perverse inasmuch as, a perusal of the balance sheets would clearly show thatthe conditions which are required to be met as per the tender document/RFP are duly met. It hasfurther been argued that at any rate, there is no allegation to the effect that the said balance sheetsare forged or fabricated. It is further argued that in the present case, even as per the allegations inthe FIR, there is no criminal breach of trust as has been defined under Section 405 IPC nor the casewould fall within the meaning of cheating as defined under Section 415 IPC and thus, the offencesunder Sections 406, 409 and 420 IPC are not attracted to the facts of the present case. It issubmitted that even as per the case of respondent no.2, it was he who was earlier employed with theaccused no.1-company and thus, the question of the petitioners, who, even as per the case ofrespondent no.2, are the employers, committing the offence under Section 409 IPC would not 23 of153 arise inasmuch as, the same would apply only in case of criminal breach of trust by a publicservant, banker, merchant or agent.11. Ground no.5:Learned senior counsel for the petitioners have submitted that the impugned order, is perverse andillegal and has been passed without application of mind as the same has been passed on the basis ofinterim reports without considering the final report and without even considering therecommendations which had been made in the interim report dated 22.07.2020. It has beensubmitted that as per the recommendations, a committee was to be formed and thereafter, acommittee was formed and the said committee had come to the conclusion that there was nocorrupt act nor there was any loss caused to the exchequer in the process of the tender and it wasrecommended that the complaint be filed. It has further been argued that it was the interim reportswhich had been considered and not the final reports which recommended taking no further action.12. Ground no.6:Learned counsel for the petitioners have submitted that in the present case there is a substantialdelay in filing the present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. inasmuch as, even as per the caseof respondent no.2, the knowledge of the entire alleged incident with respect to the alleged offenceshad been gained by respondent no.2 on 01.10.2015 and yet, the present application has been filed on27.08.2021, i.e. after a delay of 5 years and 9 months. It has been submitted that the impugnedorder deserves to be set aside on the said ground of delay alone.13. Ground no.7:Learned senior counsel for the petitioners have submitted that the complainant has no locus to filethe present complaint under Section 24 of 153 156(3) Cr.P.C. Reference has been made to Section 39Cr.P.C. to contend that a perusal of the said section would show that respondent no.2 had no locusto file the present complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. inasmuch as, none of the offences asalleged in the FIR are the offences which have been detailed in Section 39 Cr.P.C. regarding whichevery person has a right to give information to the nearest Magistrate or the Police officer for thecommission of such offence. The only offence which has been alleged to have been committed whichis included in the above section 39 Cr.P.C. is 409 IPC which as per learned senior counsel for theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/14petitioners, is not even remotely made out in the present case.14. Ground no.8:Learned senior counsel for the petitioners have submitted that the present case is a classic case offorum shopping inasmuch as, respondent no.2 has first filed successive complaints before variousauthorities in the jurisdiction of Delhi and after having been unsuccessful in extracting money fromthe petitioners and not getting the desired result then, respondent no.2 shifted his base to the Stateof Haryana where also, successive complaints have again been filed by respondent no.2, which havebeen consigned to the record room and yet, without disclosing the factum of several complaintsincluding the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. having been filed in the Delhi Courts wouldshow that the respondent no.2 has indulged in the practice of forum shopping which has beendeprecated by all the Courts and which ought to be dealt with a heavy hand.Arguments on behalf of respondent no.215. Mr. Sameer Sachdev, Advocate assisted by Mr. Saransh Sahbarwal, Advocate and Mr. BhanuKathpalia, Advocate for respondent 25 of 153 no.2 has referred to Section 39 of the Code of CriminalProcedure, 1973 to state that present respondent no.2 has every locus standi to file the presentcomplaint. It has been argued that the said provision specifically states that every person who isaware of commission of or of the intention of any other person to commit any offence punishableunder any of the sections which have been detailed in Section 39 of the Cr.P.C., can give informationto the nearest Magistrate or Police Officer regarding such commission or intention. It has beenpointed out that under Section 39(1) sub clause (viii), Section 409 has been specifically mentionedand in the present complaint submitted by respondent no.2, allegations have also been made so asto constitute the offence under Section 409 IPC. It has further been argued that in the present casealthough respondent no.2 has not submitted a complaint directly to the SHO, Police Station Sector5, Panchkula or to the SSP of the concerned area but had filed a complaint with the Director Generalof Police which was further marked by the Director General of Police to Commissioner of Police whofurther marked it to the Economic Offences Wing, which had then further marked it to ASI ParkashChand, who was the officer in the said Economic Offences Wing and said officer had submitted hisreport dated 01.09.2020, which had been taken into consideration in the impugned order and thus,as per the counsel, there is compliance of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PriyankaSrivastava's case (supra).16. Learned counsel for respondent no. 2 has further referred to a judgment of the Single Bench ofJammu and Kashmir High Court passed in CRMC no.761 of 2017 IA no.01 of 2017 titled as "GulamMohi-ud-Din. Vs. State of J&K", decided on 16.04.2021 in which after considering the judgment ofthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) it has been observed by the SingleJudge that in case the 26 of 153 investigating agency had found merit in the case then, the FIRshould not be quashed merely on the ground that the Magistrate has not followed the ratio laiddown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) particularly when theoffences stand established against the accused.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/1517. He has further submitted that respondent no.2 belongs to a very respectable family and hasnever earlier filed any complaint against any person and the present complaint has been filed by himas a Whistleblower and thus, he deserves protection available under the Whistleblowers ProtectionAct, 2014. He has specifically referred to Section 3 (c)(d) where the definition of the "complainant"and "disclosure" has been provided.18. He has also submitted that although, the proceedings before the Lokayukta, Haryana withrespect to the entire issue are pending but as per Section 24 of the Haryana Lokayukta Act, 2002, ithas specifically been provided that other remedies are not barred merely on account of the fact thatthere is institution of any inquiry or proceedings under the said Act. It has thus, been submitted thatthe present complaint should be seen independently although, proceedings before the HaryanaLokayukta are still pending.19. Learned counsel for respondent no.2, in order to rebut the arguments of learned senior counselfor the petitioners to the effect that the present complaint has been filed with a malafide motive, hasrelied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Central Bureau of Investigation vs. RaviShankar Srivastava, IAS and another reported as (2006) 7 Supreme Court Cases 188 to contend thatthe malafides of the informant would be of secondary importance and it is the material collectedduring investigation and the evidence led in the Court which decides the fate of the accused persons.27 of 15320. Further reference has been made to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India inMosiruddin Munshi vs. Md.Siraj and another, Criminal Appeal no.1168 of 2014 decided on09.05.2014 to contend that the High Court should not adopt a hypertechnical approach speciallyduring the stage of investigation. Reliance has been placed upon the judgment of Full Bench ofBombay High Court in Mr.Panchabhai Popatbhai Butanivs. State of Maharashtra, Criminal WritPetition no.270 of 2009 decided on 10.12.2009 to argue that although normally a person shouldinvoke the provisions of Section 154 of the Code before he takes recourse to the power of theMagistrate under Section 156(3) and although, such intimation would be a condition precedent forinvocation of powers of the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code but there could be caseswhere non-compliance of the provisions of Section 154(3) would not divest the Magistrate of hisjurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3). He has further relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble SupremeCourt in Kaptan Singh vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and others, Criminal Appeal no.787 of 2021decided on 13.08.2021 to argue that in a case where there are serious triable allegations incomplaint it is improper to quash the FIR in exercise of inherent powers of High Court underSection 482 Cr.P.C. On the same aspect, reliance has also been placed upon the judgment of Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra andothers, Criminal Appeal no.330 of 2021. Reliance has also been placed upon the judgment ofHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sakiri Vasu vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported as(2008) 2 Supreme Court Cases 409on the above proposition and also on the judgment of Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in HDFC Securities Ltd. &Ors. Vs. State of 28 of 153 Maharashtra &Anr.,Criminal Appeal no.1213/2016 decided on 09.12.2016.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/1621. In order to rebut the arguments of learned senior counsel for the petitioners on the aspect of theMagistrate having moved from Chapter XII to Chapter XV, learned counsel for respondent no.2 hasreferred to a judgment of High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur titled as Chandra Shekhar Jaiswaland another vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others passed in Criminal Misc. Petition no.560 of 2016decided on 02.12.2016 to contend that where the complainant had moved an application underSection 91/93 of the Cr.P.C. for calling of the original records on the basis of which the allegationslevelled against the petitioner and other accused persons could have been proved or established andacceptance of the said application by the Court and further ordering registration of an FIR afterallowing the application under Sections 91/93 Cr.P.C. would be valid and was thus, upheld by theChhattisgarh High Court. It has been submitted that merely because the Magistrate has exercisedthe power under Section 91 Cr.P.C. would not mean that the Magistrate has moved from Chapter XIIto Chapter XV of Cr.P.C. Reliance has also been placed upon the judgment of the Hon'ble SupremeCourt of India in R.R. Chari vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh, Criminal Appeal no.1 of 1950 decided on19.03.1951, to contend that the word "cognizance" is a word of somewhat indefinite import and it isperhaps not always used in exactly the same sense and in a case when the Magistrate applies hismind not for the purpose of proceeding under the subsequent section of this Chapter, but for takingaction of some other kind, e.g. ordering investigation under Section 156(3), or issuing a searchwarrant for the purpose of the investigation, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of theoffence. On a similar aspect, reliance has also been placed 29 of 153 upon the judgment of Hon'bleSupreme Court in Srinivas Gundluri vs. M/s Sepco Electric Power Construction Corpn. & Ors.,Crl.A. no.1377 of 2010 decided on 30.07.2010.22. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has submitted that the objection raised by learned seniorcounsel for the petitioners to the effect that second FIR cannot be registered had been considered bythe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Nirmal Singh Kahlon vs. State of Punjab and others, reportedas 2009 (1) SCC 441 and on the basis of said judgment it has been argued that where it has beenfound subsequently that the conspiracy had a larger canvas with broader ramifications, whenequated with the earlier conspiracy which covered a smaller field of narrower dimensions, then theconspiracies which are the subject matter of the two cases cannot be said to be identical though theconspiracy which is the subject matter of the first case may, perhaps, be said to have turned out tobe a part of the conspiracy which is the subject matter of the second case.

They were not made party although, they have been madeparty in the complaint dated 23.01.2020 (P-21)(Page 478) filed before the Lokayukta, Haryana.The same was done since respondent no.2 was well aware that prior sanction would be required toprosecute government officials. Monishankar Hazara and Sameer Bansal petitioners inCRM-M-6692- 2022, who were never made the proposed accused in any of the complaints or evenin the proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in 48 of 153 Rohini Courts, Delhi, have been arrayedas accused no.9 and 10 in the present complaint.In the present complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., there is no reference to the earlierapplication filed under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the Rohini Courts, New Delhi, nor it has beenstated that similar allegations with respect to forgery, cheating and corruption had already beenmade in the said application and it has been deceivingly only mentioned in para 28 (page 547) of thepresent complaint/application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. that an FIR no.419/2017 had beenregistered under Sections 66, 66-C of the I.T. Act.The fact that cancellation report has been submitted in FIR no.419/2017 has not been mentioned.No reference was made to the complaint dated 05.09.2016 (P-12) (page 400) (complaint no.1) or tothe complaint dated 21.02.2017 (P-14) (Page 410) (complaint no.2).Paragraphs 41 and 42 (Page 551) of the present complaint/application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.Care reproduced hereinbelow:-"41. That the forged documents so prepared have been submitted in collusion withthe officers in the office of the HSHRC, Sector 6, Panchkula and the ill-gotten gainsMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/27have also been released from the said office in Sector 2, Panchkula therefore thisHon'ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain this matter.42. That no such or similar petition against the impugned orders, except asmentioned in the petition has been filed or is pending or decided by this Hon'bleCourt or the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, 49 of 153 Chandigarh or in theHon'ble Supreme Court of India or any court of law."Although, the proceedings with respect to cancellation report of FIR no.419/2017 are pending andnow listed for 01.04.2022, yet the said proceedings were concealed. The averments with respect tothe jurisdiction of Panchkula Court were in complete contradiction to the averments made in theearlier application under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. filed in Rohini Courts, Delhi (Complaint-3).Although the government officials have been left out from the present complaint but still, in thepresent complaint it has been prayed that FIR under Section 409 IPC amongst other sections, beregistered. In para 5 of the present complaint, it has been mentioned by respondent no.2 that he isnot the signatory to any material documents submitted to the government department but the saidaverments are even contrary to the observations made in the impugned order dated 15.12.2021 tothe effect that respondent no.2 had participated in the entire bidding process.The present complaint dated 27.08.2021 (Complaint-7) has been filed after a delay of more than 5years and 9 months inasmuch as, as per paragraph 39 of the said complaint, the complainant hadgained knowledge qua the alleged illegal acts and incident on 01.10.2015. 15.12.2021 P-1 (Page 73)Impugned order passed directing registration of the FIR. 23.12.2021 P-2 (Page 80) FIR no.508registered under Sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC at Police Station Sector5, Panchkula in pursuance of the said order.50 of 15334. The above chronology of events clearly demonstrates that respondent no.2 has played hide andseek with the Court. Apart from concealing several complaints and the inquiry reports thereof, thefiling of the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,Rohini Courts, New Delhi, has also been concealed. Sub para (v) of para 2, which has beenreproduced hereinabove, would clearly show that the allegations made in the earlier complaintunder Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the Rohini Courts, New Delhi were similar to the allegationswhich have been levelled in the present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before thePanchkula Courts, Haryana. On account of active concealment of the said applications and theorders passed there on, two FIRs stand registered, one in Delhi and the other in Panchkula. TheChief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula, was neither informed by respondent no.2 about filing of theapplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. nor it was brought to the notice of the Court thatallegations in the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in the Rohini Courts, Delhi weresimilar to the allegations which have been made in the present complaint under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/2835. It has been repeatedly held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and various High Courts thatthe registration of the second FIR with respect to the same cause of action is illegal and deserves tobe quashed and further, filing of successive applications without disclosing the final report in theearlier applications and instituting criminal proceedings with a malafide motive to wreak vengeance,would be valid grounds for seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings. Some of the judgments onthe above aspects are being referred to, hereinbelow:51 of 153 The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Krishna Lal Chawla's case (supra) has held asunder:-"6. Indeed, a closer look at the decision in Upkar Singh takes us to the contraryconclusion. In regard to the question of material improvements made in asubsequent private complaint by the same complainant against the same accusedwith regard to the same incident, it may be useful to refer to the following excerptfrom Upkar Singh, which further clarifies the holding in T.T. Antony:"17...In our opinion, this Court in that case only held that any further complaint bythe same complainant or others against the same accused, subsequent to theregistration of a case, is prohibited under the Code because an investigation in thisregard would have already started and further complaint against the same accusedwill amount to an improvement on the facts mentioned in the original complaint,hence will be prohibited under Section 162 of the Code."(emphasis supplied) It is the aforementioned part of the holding in Upkar Singh thatbears directly and strongly upon the present case.7. This Court in Upkar Singh has clearly stated that any further complaint by thesame complainant against the same accused, after the case has already beenregistered, will be deemed to be an improvement from the original complaint.Though Upkar Singh was rendered in the context of a case involving cognizableoffences, the same principle would also apply where a person gives information of anon-cognizable offence and subsequently lodges a private complaint with respect tothe same offence against the same accused person. Even in a non-cognizable case, thepolice 52 of 153 officer after the order of the Magistrate, is empowered to investigatethe offence in the same manner as a cognizable case, except the power to arrestwithout a warrant. Therefore, the complainant cannot subject the accused to a doublewhammy of investigation by the police and inquiry before the Magistrate.8. We are cognizant of the fact that in the present case, no investigation had begunpursuant to NCR No. 158/2012 filed by the Respondent No. 2 for a certain period.However, the overall concern expressed by this Court in Upkar Singh, about themisuse of successive complaints by the same party, where the second complaint isclearly propped up to materially improve on the earlier one, resonates with us. Weregret to say that the same thing which this Court had categorically prohibited inMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/29Upkar Singh has happened in the present case.9. The grave implications of allowing such misuse may be understood better in lightof the following exposition by this Court in Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah v. CBI & anr,(2013) 6 SCC 348:"37. This Court has consistently laid down the law on the issue interpreting the Code,that a second FIR in respect of an offence or different offences committed in thecourse of the same transaction is not only impermissible but it violates Article 21 ofthe Constitution. In T.T. Antony [(2001) 6 SCC 181 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1048], this Courthas categorically held that registration of second FIR (which is not a cross-case) is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution." (emphasis supplied)10. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees that the right to life and liberty shall notbe taken away except 53 of 153 by due process of law. Permitting multiple complaintsby the same party in respect of the same incident, whether it involves a cognizable orprivate complaint offence, will lead to the accused being entangled in numerouscriminal proceedings. As such, he would be forced to keep surrendering his libertyand precious time before the police and the Courts, as and when required in eachcase. As this Court has held in Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah (supra), such an absurdand mischievous interpretation of the provisions of the CrPC will not stand the test ofconstitutional scrutiny, and therefore cannot be adopted by us.11. The implications of such successive FIRs on an individual's rights under Article 21of the Constitution has been elaborated further in T.T. Antony (supra):"27. A just balance between the fundamental rights of the citizens under Articles 19and 21 of the Constitution and the expansive power of the police to investigate acognizable offence has to be struck by the court. There cannot be any controversy thatsubsection (8) of section 173 CrPC, 1973 empowers the police to make furtherinvestigation, obtain further evidence (both oral and documentary) and forward afurther report or reports to the Magistrate. In Narang case [Ram Lal Narang v. State(Delhi Admn.), (1979) 2 SCC 322 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 479] it was, however, observed thatit would be appropriate to conduct further investigation with the permission of thecourt. However, the sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting acitizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident,giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successiveFIRs whether before or after filing 54 of 153 the final report under section 173(2)CrPC, 1973. (emphasis supplied)"12. Thus, it is incumbent upon this Court to preserve this delicate balance betweenthe power to investigate offences under the CrPC, and the fundamental right of theindividual to be free from frivolous and repetitive criminal prosecutions forced uponMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/30him by the might of the State. If the Respondent No. 2 was aggrieved by lack ofspeedy investigation in the earlier case filed by him, the appropriate remedy wouldhave been to apply to the Magistrate under section 155(2), CrPC, 1973 for directionsto the police in this regard. Filing a private complaint without any prelude, after a gapof six years from the date of giving information to the police, smacks of mala fide onthe part of Respondent No. 2.13. It is also crucial to note that, in the fresh complaint case instituted by him,Respondent No. 2 seems to have deliberately suppressed the material fact that acharge sheet was already filed in relation to the same incident, against him and hiswife, pursuant to NCR No.160/2012 (Crime No. 283/2017) filed by Appellant No.1'sson. No reference to this charge sheet is found in the private complaint, or in thestatements under section 200, CrPC, 1973 filed by Respondent No. 2 and his wife. Infact, both the private complaint and the statement filed on behalf of his wife, merelystate that the police officials have informed them that investigation is ongoingpursuant to their NCR No.158/2012. The wife's statement additionally even statesthat no action has been taken so far by the police. It is the litigant's bounden duty tomake a full and true disclosure of facts. It is a matter of trite law, and yet bearsrepetition, that suppression of material facts before a court amounts to abuse of theprocess of the court, and shall be dealt with a heavy hand (Ram Dhan v. State of UttarPradesh & Anr., 55 of 153 (2012) 5 SCC 536; K.D. Sharma v. Steel Authority of IndiaLtd.(2008) 12 SCC 481)."xxx xxx xxx24. As recorded by us above, the present controversy poses a typical example offrivolous litigants abusing court process to achieve their mischievous ends. In thecase before us, the Magistrate was aware of the significant delay in the filing ofprivate complaint by Respondent No. 2, and of the material improvements from theearlier NCR No. 158/2012 which were made in the private complaint. It wasincumbent on the Magistrate to examine any possibility of abuse of process of thecourt, make further enquiries, and dismiss the frivolous complaint at the outset afterjudicial application of mind.25. However, this was not done - the Magistrate issued process against the Appellantsby order dated 4.04.2019, and this controversy has now reached this Court fordisposal.26. It is a settled canon of law that this Court has inherent powers to prevent theabuse of its own processes, that this Court shall not suffer a litigant utilising theinstitution of justice for unjust means. Thus, it would be only proper for this Court todeny any relief to a litigant who attempts to pollute the stream of justice by coming toit with his unclean hands. Similarly, a litigant pursuing frivolous and vexatiousproceedings cannot claim unlimited right upon court time and public money toMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/31achieve his ends.27. This Court's inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to do 'completejustice' empowers us to give preference to equity and a justice-oriented approach overthe strict rigours of procedural law (State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih (Whitewasher),(2014) 8 SCC 883). This 56 of 153 Court has used this inherent power to quashcriminal proceedings where the proceedings are instituted with an oblique motive, oron manufactured evidence (Monica Kumar (Dr.) & anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh,(2008) 8 SCC 781). Other decisions have held that inherent powers of High Courtsprovided in section 482, CrPC, 1973 may be utilised to quash criminal proceedingsinstituted after great delay, or with vengeful or malafide motives. (Sirajul &ors. v.State of Uttar Pradesh, (2015) 9 SCC 201; State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, AIR 1992Supreme Court 604). Thus, it is the constitutional duty of this Court to quashcriminal proceedings that were instituted by misleading the court and abusing itsprocesses of law, only with a view to harass the hapless litigants.                xxx   xxx       xxx         Our Conclusions:29. The impugned judgment of the High Court dated 28.09.2020 in MiscellaneousPetition No. 2561 of 2020 is set aside.30. The proceedings in Complaint Case No.2943/2018, including the order ofsummons against the Appellants dated 4.04.2019 be quashed. 31. Further,proceedings pursuant to NCR No. 158/2012 dated 5.08.2012 filed by Respondent No.2 also be quashed, in order to foreclose further frivolous litigation.32. Any other criminal cases between the parties initiated by them in relation to theincident dated 5.08.2012, including the criminal proceedings arising from NCRNo.160/2012 (Crime No. 283/2017) instituted by the Appellants, are quashed inexercise of our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, in the interests of givingquietus to these criminal proceedings arising out of a petty incident 9 years ago.57 of 15333. The Appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms."A perusal of the above reproduced judgment would show that the act of filing successivecomplaints/FIRs by the same party, even with material improvements, has been held to beimpermissible as it violates the right to life and liberty of an individual as enshrined under Article 21of the Constitution of India. It has been observed that permitting multiple complaints by the sameparty with respect to the same incident whether it involves a cognizable or non-cognizable offences,will lead the accused to be entangled in numerous criminal proceedings which would also waste theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/32precious time of the courts and the police. It had further been observed that in case, the complainantis aggrieved by the lack of a speedy investigation in the first FIR / complaint, then necessary remedyregarding the same should be taken and the filing of a subsequent complaint after a gap of severalyears would smack of mala fide on the part of the complainant. In the above said case also, there wassuppression of material facts by the complainant therein at the time of filing of the secondcomplaint. It was observed that it was the bounden duty of the complainant to make a full and truedisclosure of all material facts and non-disclosure of the same would amount to abuse of the processof the Court and shall be dealt with a heavy hand. It was also observed that the High Courts underSection 482 Cr.P.C. have the power to quash the criminal proceedings which have been institutedafter a great delay or with vengeance or with a mala fide motive and that it is the constitutional dutyof the High Courts to quash criminal proceedings which were instituted by misleading the Court.The criminal proceedings thereon, were accordingly quashed. The above said judgment will applywith full force to the facts of the present case as, on account of the malicious conduct and activeconcealment, respondent no.2 has managed to get two FIRs registered 58 of 153 against thepetitioners on the same cause of action. The due course in law available to respondent no.2 was tochallenge the orders passed in the proceedings under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in the Delhi Court incase, he was dissatisfied with the non-registration of the FIR under certain offences or respondentno.2 should have filed objections/protest petition in the cancellation proceeding with respect to thefirst FIR registered in Delhi but the same having not been done, respondent no.2 now cannot bepermitted to institute a subsequent application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. with respect to thesame incident and on a similar set of allegations.36. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in "T.T. Antony's case (supra) has observed as under: -"However, the sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizeneach time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident, givingrise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive FIRswhether before or after filing the final report under Section 173(2) CriminalProcedure Code, 1973 It would clearly be beyond the purview of sections 154 and 156Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 nay, a case of abuse of the statutory power ofinvestigation in a given case. In our view a case of a fresh investigation based on thesecond or successive FIRs, not being a counter case, filed in connection with the sameor connected cognizable offence alleged to have been committed in the course of thesame transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the first FIR eitherinvestigation is underway or final report under Section 173(2) has been forwarded tothe Magistrate, may be a fit case for exercise of power under Section 482 CriminalProcedure Code, 1973 or under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution."59 of 153 A perusal of the above judgment would show that it was observed by theHon'ble Supreme Court of India that in case, with respect to one incident an FIR hasalready been registered, then a second FIR with respect to the same incident cannotbe registered and in case, the same is registered then the High Court while exercisingits powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. would be well within its power to quash thesecond FIR. The same principle has been followed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/33the case of "Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah's case (supra)..37. A Coordinate Bench of this Court in "Kuldeep Raj Mahajan vs. Hukam Chand" in a judgmentdated 05.12.2007 passed in CRM-34272- M of 2003 had observed as under:"It would indicate that the respondent, after being aware of the cancellation of theFIR, filed the impugned complaint, but did not disclose in the complaint that FIRlodged by him had been cancelled.                   xxx    xxx       xxx                   Perusal        of        impugned    summoning         order(Annexure P-2) reveals that there is no reference at all to the investigationreport/cancellation report of the police in the summoning order. Without consideringthe investigation report/cancellation report of the police, the impugned summoningorder could not have been legally passed by the learned Magistrate. The respondent,despite knowledge, concealed the cancellation report of the police from the learnedMagistrate. This is another indicator of mala fide on the part of the respondent.xxx xxx xxx However, this Court cannot be a helpless spectator when it is made outthat the criminal prosecution is mala fide and an abuse of the process of the court. Infact, this Court has inherent power and corresponding 60 of 153 duty to preventabuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In theinstant case, the impugned complaint is result of mala fide as the respondent wasnursing grudge against the petitioner as discussed herein above.xxx xxx xxx After investigation by Gazetted Officer, the FIR lodged in the samematter was found to be false and cancellation report was submitted by the police. Therespondent, despite being aware of the cancellation report, concealed the same fromthe learned Magistrate. The impugned summoning order has also been passedwithout considering or even referring to the cancellation report. Keeping in view allthese circumstances, it is a fit case in which this Court has to exercise its inherentpowers under section 482 of the Code by quashing the impugned complaint andsummoning order so as to prevent the abuse of process of court and to secure theends of justice."A perusal of the above judgment would show that it has been observed that the High Court cannotbe a helpless spectator when it is made out that the criminal prosecution is mala fide and an abuseof the process of the court and that the High Court has inherent power and a corresponding duty toprevent the abuse of the process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice and in thesaid case, the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was allowed.38. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Moti Lal Songara Vs. Prem Prakash @ Pappu", reported as2013(9) SCC 199, has observed as under: -Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/34"2. The factual score of the case in hand frescoes a scenario and reflects the mindsetof the first respondent which would justifiably invite the statement "court is not alaboratory where children come to play". The action 61 of 153 of theaccused-respondent depicts the attitude where one calculatedly conceives the conceptthat he is entitled to play a game of chess in a court of law and the propriety, expectednorms from a litigant and the abhorrence of courts to the issues of suppression offacts can comfortably be kept at bay. Such a proclivity appears to have weigheduppermost in his mind on the base that he can play in aid of technicalities to his ownadvantage and the law, in its essential substance, and justice, with its divineattributes, can unceremoniously be buried in the grave.xxx xxx xxx18. The second limb of the submission is whether in the obtaining factual matrix, theorder passed by the High Court discharging the accused- respondent is justified inlaw. We have clearly stated that though the respondent was fully aware about the factthat charges had been framed against him by the learned trial Judge, yet he did notbring the same to the notice of the revisional court hearing the revision against theorder taking cognizance. It is a clear case of suppression. It was within the specialknowledge of the accused. Any one who takes recourse to method of suppression in acourt of law, is, in actuality, playing fraud with the court, and the maxim supressioveri, expression faisi, i.e., suppression of the truth is equivalent to the expression offalsehood, gets attracted.xxx xxx xxx19. Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the order passed by the High Court inCriminal Revision No. 327 of 2011 and the order passed by the learned AdditionalDistrict and Sessions Judge, No.1, Jodhpur, in Criminal Revision No. 7 of 2009 areset aside and it is directed that the trial which is pending before the learnedAdditional District and Sessions Judge, No. 3, Jodhpur, shall proceed in accordancewith law".62 of 153 A perusal of the above would show that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had come downheavily on the litigants/persons who are guilty of suppression of facts in a court of law. In the saidcase, the accused while challenging the summoning order under Section 319 Cr.P.C., had notbrought to the notice of the Court that the charges had been framed against him and was successfulin getting the order under Section 319 Cr.P.C. set aside, which was reversed by the Hon'ble SupremeCourt. While reversing the said order, the factum with respect to suppression of material fact, wasconsidered to be one of the primary grounds to be held against the accused therein, and it wasobserved that anyone who takes recourse to the method of suppressing information in a court oflaw, is, in actuality, playing fraud with the court, and the maxim supressio veri, expression faisi, i.e.,suppression of the truth is equivalent to the expression of falsehood, gets attracted.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/3539. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Ram Dhan vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and anotherreported as (2012) 5 Supreme Court Cases 536 has specifically held in paragraph 12 thatsuppression of material facts and filing of the successive complaints amounts to abuse of process ofthe Court. Paragraph 12 of the judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-"12. The petitioner is guilty of suppressing the material fact. Admittedly, filing ofsuccessive petitions before the court amounts to abuse of the process of the court.Thus, we are not inclined to examine the issue any further."The ratio of law laid down in the above said cases would apply in the present case.The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Baijnath Jha vs. Sita Ram and another, reported as (2008) 8Supreme Court Cases 77 has held as under:-63 of 153 "8. The backgrounds clearly show that the proceedings instituted were malafide, based on vague assertions and were initiated with mala fide intents andconstitute sheer abuse of process of law. No reason was shown before the High Courtas to why the complainant chose not to proceed and one of the four persons initiallynamed. The cases at hand fit in with category (7) of Bhajan Lal's case (supra).9. The appeals are allowed and the proceedings in complaint case No. 40 of 1994 inthe Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Patna City stand quashed."In the above-said case, the complaint was filed by the complainant after being released on bail,before the Judicial Magistrate, alleging that accused persons and one Ravinder Kumar Singh haddemanded illegal gratification from the complainant. The Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizanceof the same and the petition filed before the High Court for quashing of the same by the accusedpersons had been dismissed. Thereafter, the complainant therein filed the case before the Hon'bleSupreme Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court found that the proceedings were instituted onmalafide basis and thus, found the case to be a fit case falling under category no. 7 as illustrated inBhajan Lal's case. One of the factors that was brought forth before the Hon'ble Supreme Court wasthat the complainant therein had chosen not to proceed against one of the four persons who hadbeen initially added. In the present case, 17 government officials, against whom specific allegationshave been levelled in various complaints including the complaint before the Lokayukta and whichwas filed prior to the filing of the present application under Section 156(3),were not made asproposed accused in the present application under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C.64 of 15340. To be fair to the counsel for respondent no.2, this Court would now like to consider thejudgments cited by the learned counsel for respondent no.2 in order to make out a case that even ifthere was a concealment of the earlier application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and the othercomplaints were also not disclosed or that the proceedings initiated by Respondent no. 2 were malafide, then also, the High Court should not exercise its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/36FIR. The first judgment which has been relied upon by the learned counsel for respondent no.2 isthe judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Kapil Aggarwal's case (supra). The saidjudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court would further the case of the petitioners and not that ofrespondent no.2. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-"Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and orderdated08.09.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in CriminalMiscellaneous Writ Petition No. 18308 of 2017, by which the High Court hasdismissed the said writ petition preferred by the appellants herein, filed under Article226 of the Constitution of India, for quashing the first information report registeredas Case Crime No. 790 of 2017, under Sections 420/406 IPC, Police Station LoniBorder, District Ghaziabad, the original writ petitioners/accused have preferred thepresent appeal.xxx xxx xxx6. However, at the same time, if it is found that the subsequent FIR is an abuse ofprocess of law and/or the same has been lodged only to harass the accused, the samecan be quashed in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution or inexercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,1973 In that case, the 65 of 153complaint case will proceed further in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C.6.1 As observed and held by this Court in catena of decisions, inherent jurisdictionunder Section482 Cr.P.C., 1973 and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution isdesigned to achieve salutary purpose that criminal proceedings ought not to bepermitted to degenerate into weapon of harassment. When the Court is satisfied thatcriminal proceedings amount to an abuse of process of law or that it amounts tobringing pressure upon accused, in exercise of inherent powers, such proceedings canbe quashed.6.2 As held by this Court in the case of Parbatbhai Aahir v. State of Gujarat (2017) 9SCC 64,,Section 482 Cr.P.C., 1973 is prefaced with an overriding provision. Thestatute saves the inherent power of the High Court, as a superior court, to make suchorders as are necessary(i) to prevent an abuse of the process of any Court; or (ii) otherwise to secure the endsof justice. Same are the powers with the High Court, when it exercises the powersunder Article 226 of the Constitution.Xxx xxx xxx .....Therefore, when the impugned FIR is nothing but an abuse of processof law and to harass the appellants- accused, we are of the opinion that the HighCourt ought to have exercised the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution ofIndia/482 Cr.P.C. and ought to have quashed the impugned FIR to secure the ends ofjustice.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/379. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal isallowed. The impugned criminal proceedings/FIR registered as Case Crime No. 790of 2017, under Sections 420/406IPC, with the police station Loni Border, DistrictGhaziabad are hereby quashed and set aside on the aforesaid grounds. We 66 of 153make it clear that we have not expressed anything on merits on the allegations madeby respondent no.1 against the appellants as the proceedings in the form of156(3)Cr.P.C application are pending before the learned Magistrate. The learnedMagistrate shall now proceed further with the said application, in accordance withlaw and on its own merits. Respondent No.1 may proceed further with the saidproceedings, if he so chooses and is advised.10. With these observations, the present appeal is allowed."A perusal of the above judgment would show that in the said case initially, an application underSection 156(3) Cr.P.C. was filed by the complainant before the learned Additional Chief JudicialMagistrate, Ghaziabad for registration of an FIR and the said application was treated as a complaintunder Section 200, which fact had been challenged by the complainant therein, by filing a criminalrevision and in the criminal revision, the order of the Magistrate was set aside and the matter wasremanded back and the said complaint was stated to be pending after remand. The complainant gotthe FIR registered, which was sought to be challenged by the accused. The Hon'ble High Courtrefused to quash the said FIR. Against the said order, the accused therein filed appeal before theHon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to quash the FIR by observingthat registration of second FIR is an abuse of the process of the Court. Thus, the said judgment doesnot further the case of the respondent no.2. Learned Counsel for Respondent no. 2 is wanting totake benefit of the observation made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to the effect that an applicationpending under Section 156(3) would not come in the way of registration of an FIR. The saidobservation would not apply in the 67 of 153 present case inasmuch as, in the present case, the firstapplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. is not pending and the orders have already been passed inthe same and the FIR in pursuance of the said order, already stands registered. Moreover, the firstapplication under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. was filed in Delhi and the first FIR has also been registeredin Delhi whereas, the present second application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. has been filed beforethe Panchkula Courts and the FIR has been registered in Panchkula and thus, the observationshighlighted by the learned counsel for respondent no.2 in the above-said judgment would not applyto the present case.41. The second judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for respondent no.2 is the judgment ofthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Central Bureau of Investigation's case (supra). It is arguedthat in the said judgment it has been observed that malafide of informant would be of secondaryimportance. In the said case, the Central Bureau of Investigation had approached the Hon'bleSupreme Court as the petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. by the accused therein had beenallowed and FIR registered against the accused under Sections 120-B, 167, 168, 177A IPC andSection 13(2) and 13(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, had been quashed solely on the groundof jurisdiction. The High Court had found the ground of jurisdiction to be valid on the basis of adocument which was misconstrued to be a notification rescinding an earlier notification. TheMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/38Hon'ble Supreme Court had observed that there was no notification revoking the earlier notificationand the letter on which emphasis had been laid by the High Court, was not relevant and the saidletter was not even a notification and thus, the High Court was not justified to hold that there wasnotification rescinding the earlier notification. The facts of the said case were completely differentfrom the facts of the present case. Moreover, the 68 of 153 legal arguments raised in the presentpetition including the argument of filing of earlier application under section 156(3) and ordersthereon, earlier complaints and the concealment thereof, respondent no.2 being an ex- employee ofaccused no.1-company seeking money through legal notice, the offences as mentioned in the FIR notbeing prima facie made out (as will be discussed hereinafter), forum shopping etc., were not theissues raised in the abovesaid judgment. Moreover, at any rate it has been observed that malafide isof secondary importance, and thus, has not been held to be irrelevant.42. The third judgment on which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for respondentno.2 is judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Nirmal Singh Kahlon's case (supra). Onthe basis of the said judgment, it has been contended that a second FIR can be registered. A perusalof the said judgment would show that in the said case, there was a big scam with respect to therecruitment of Panchayat Secretary. An FIR was lodged by the Vigilance Department against certainpersons including Nirmal Singh Kahlon for commission of offence under the Prevention ofCorruption Act and under certain provisions of IPC. Thereafter, the Secretary of Government ofPunjab had issued a letter opining that the case be investigated by the Crime Branch and when thematter came up before the High Court, it was observed by the High Court that the State Governmenthad an option of suo motu making further investigations by removing all the officers who had beennamed in the report from the respective offices so as to ensure further inquiry is not influenced bythem or in the alternative to let the Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the entire scandalinvolving the appointment of Panchayat Secretary. Subsequent to the passing of the said order, theState Government made a 69 of 153 statement that a decision had been taken to hand over theinvestigation in respect of the scandal to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Although, the CentralBureau of Investigation was not initially inclined to take over the matter but ultimately informed theHigh Court that a special team had been constituted to investigate the matter and the CentralBureau of Investigation thereafter, registered an FIR. When the matter came up before the Hon'bleSupreme Court of India, it was observed in paragraph 32 of the said judgment that two FIRs couldnot be maintainable on the basis of the same cause of action and it was observed in paragraph 36that ordinarily the Supreme Court would have accepted the argument to the effect that High Courtshould not direct Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate into a particular offence buthowever, since the offence was not ordinary in nature and it involved investigation into theallegations of commission of fraud in a systematic manner and it had wide ramifications as a formerMinister of the State was involved. Thus, the said case had been taken to be as an exceptional case. Itwas further observed in paragraphs 44 and 46 that the FIR was registered by the Central Bureau ofInvestigation, i.e., second FIR was lodged after a detailed preliminary inquiry had been conductedand statements of a large number of persons were recorded and there were as many as 15 categoriesof irregularities committed by various persons involved in the said selection process in which severalpersons holding very high posts were also involved. It was observed that the first FIR, which wasregistered in the State of Punjab, contained only the misdeeds of individuals. It was further observedin paras 48, 49 and 50 of the said judgment that the Hon'ble High Court had given two options toMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/39the State Government and the State Government had taken the decision to hand over theinvestigation of the scandal to the Central Bureau of Investigation and offences committed 70 of 153by an individual or two are different from an offence disclosed in a scandal involving a large numberof officials from the lowest category to the highest. It is in the said background that the appeals weredismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In the present case, a second FIR has not been registeredby Central Bureau of Investigation with respect to any scam of a large scale. There are no orders ofthe High Court giving an option to the State as was given in the above-said case nor there is anystatement on behalf of the State to hand over the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Eventhe allegations made in the earlier complaints including the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.before Rohini Courts, Delhi, are substantially the same to the ones made in the present applicationunder Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the Panchkula Courts, Haryana and thus, the above saidjudgment would not further the case of respondent no.2.43. Ground no.2: Offences under Sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC underwhich the impugned FIR has been registered, are not made out in the present case.Before adverting to the facts of the present case, it is relevant to take note of two judgments of theHon'ble Supreme Court of India. The first judgment is Md. Ibrahim's case (supra). The relevantportion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-"2. Second respondent herein filed a complaint against appellants 1 to 3 (accused 1 to3) and two others before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madhubani, alleging that hewas the owner of Katha No. 715 Khasra No. 1971 and 1973 admeasuring 1 bigha, 5Katha and 18 Dhurs; that the first accused who had no connection with the said landand who had no title thereto, had executed two registered sale deeds dated 2.6.2003in favour of the second accused in respect of a portion of the said land measuring - 8Khatas and 13 Dhurs; and that the third, 71 of 153 fourth and fifth accused beingrespectively the witness, scribe and stamp vendor in regard to the sale deeds hadconspired with accused 1 and 2 to forge the said documents; and that when heconfronted accused 1 and 2 about the said forgery, they abused him and hit him withfists and told him that he can do what he wanted, but they will get possession of theland on the basis of the said documents.3. The learned Magistrate by order dated 19.7.2003 took cognizance of the offencesunder sections 323, 341, 420, 467, 471 and 504 of Indian Penal Code (for short, 'theCode') and referred the complaint for investigation under section 156(3) of the Codeof Criminal Procedure (for short, 'Criminal Procedure Code'). On the basis thereof aFirst Information Report was registered on 10.10.2003 with Pandaul Police Station.After investigation, a charge sheet came to be filed on 4.9.2004.xxx xxx xxx7. This Court has time and again drawn attention to the growing tendency ofcomplainants attempting to give the cloak of a criminal offence to matters which areMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/40essentially and purely civil in nature, obviously either to apply pressure on theaccused, or out of enmity towards the accused, or to subject the accused toharassment. Criminal courts should ensure that proceedings before it are not used forsettling scores or to pressurise parties to settle civil disputes. But at the same, itshould be noted that several disputes of a civil nature may also contain theingredients of criminal offences and if so, will have to be tried as criminal offences,even if they also amount to civil disputes. [See : G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P., 2000(1)RCR (Criminal) 707 : [2000(2) SCC 636] and Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC IndiaLtd., 2006(3) RCR (Criminal) 740 : 2006(2) Apex Criminal 637 : [2006(6) 72 of 153SCC 736]. Let us examine the matter keeping the said principles in mind.Sections 467 and 471 of the Penal Code8. Let us first consider whether the complaint averments even assuming to be truemake out the ingredients of the offences punishable either under section 467 orsection 471 of Penal Code. Section 467 (in so far as it is relevant to this case) providesthat whoever forges a document which purports to be a valuable security, shall bepunished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for aterm which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. Section 471,relevant to our purpose, provides that whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses asgenuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forgeddocument, shall be punished in the same manner as if he had forged such document.Section 470 defines a forged document as a false document made by forgery.9. The term "forgery" used in these two sections is defined in section 463. Whoevermakes any false documents with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or toany person, or to support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part withproperty, or to enter into express or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraudor that the fraud may be committed, commits forgery. Section 464 defining "makinga false document" is extracted below :"464. Making a false document. - A person is said to make a false document or falseelectronic record -First. - Who dishonestly or fraudulently -(a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document; (b) makes ortransmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;73 of 153(c) affixes any digital signature on any electronic record;Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/41(d) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of thedigital signature, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document ora part of document, electronic record or digital signature was made, signed, sealed,executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or bywhose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; orSecondly. - Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, bycancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any materialpart thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with digital signature eitherby himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the timeof such alternation; or Thirdly. - Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any personto sign, seal, execute or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his digitalsignature on any electronic record knowing that such person by reason ofunsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practisedupon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or thenature of the alteration.Explanation 1 - A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery.Explanation 2 - The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in thename of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was 74 of153 made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.[Note : The words 'digital signature' wherever it occurs were substituted by the words'electronic signature' by Amendment Act 10 of 2009]."The condition precedent for an offence under sections 467 and 471 is forgery. Thecondition precedent for forgery is making a false document (or false electronic recordor part thereof). This case does not relate to any false electronic record. Therefore,the question is whether the first accused, in executing and registering the two saledeeds purporting to sell a property (even if it is assumed that it did not belong tohim), can be said to have made and executed false documents, in collusion with theother accused.10. An analysis of section 464 of Penal Code shows that it divides false documentsinto three categories : 10.1) The first is where a person dishonestly or fraudulentlymakes or executes a document with the intention of causing it to be believed thatsuch document was made or executed by some other person, or by the authority ofsome other person, by whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made orexecuted. 10.2) The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, bycancellation or otherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawfulauthority, after it has been made or executed by either himself or any other person.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/4210.3) The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person tosign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a)unsoundness of mind; or (b) intoxication; or (c) deception practised upon him, knowthe contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.11. In short, a person is said to have made a 'false document', if (i) he made orexecuted a document 75 of 153 claiming to be someone else or authorised by someoneelse; or (ii) he altered or tampered a document; or (iii) he obtained a document bypracticing deception, or from a person not in control of his senses.12. The sale deeds executed by first appellant, clearly and obviously do not fall underthe second and third categories of 'false documents'. It therefore remains to be seenwhether the claim of the complainant that the execution of sale deeds by the firstaccused, who was in no way connected with the land, amounted to committingforgery of the documents with the intention of taking possession of complainant'sland (and that accused 2 to 5 as the purchaser, witness, scribe and stamp vendorcolluded with first accused in execution and registration of the said sale deeds) wouldbring the case under the first category. There is a fundamental difference between aperson executing a sale deed claiming that the property conveyed is his property, anda person executing a sale deed by impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to beauthorised or empowered by the owner, to execute the deed on owner's behalf. Whena person executes a document conveying a property describing it as his, there are twopossibilities. The first is that he bonafide believes that the property actually belongsto him. The second is that he may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be hiseven though he knows that it is not his property. But to fall under first category of'false documents', it is not sufficient that a document has been made or executeddishonestly or fraudulently. There is a further requirement that it should have beenmade with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made orexecuted by, or by the authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority heknows that it was not made or executed. When a document is executed by a personclaiming a property which is not 76 of 153 his, he is not claiming that he is someoneelse nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone else. Therefore, execution ofsuch document (purporting to convey some property of which he is not the owner) isnot execution of a false document as defined under section 464 of the Code. If what isexecuted is not a false document, there is no forgery. If there is no forgery, thenneither section 467 nor section 471 of the Code are attracted.Section 420 Indian Penal Code13. Let us now examine whether the ingredients of an offence of cheating are madeout. The essential ingredients of the offence of "cheating" are as follows :(i) deception of a person either by making a false or misleading representation or bydishonest concealment or by any other act or omission; (ii) fraudulent or dishonestMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/43inducement of that person to either deliver any property or to consent to theretention thereof by any person or to intentionally induce that person so deceived todo or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived;and (iii) such act or omission causing or is likely to cause damage or harm to thatperson in body, mind, reputation or property. To constitute an offence under section420, there should not only be cheating, but as a consequence of such cheating, theaccused should have dishonestly induced the person deceived (i) to deliver anyproperty to any person, or (ii) to make, alter or destroy wholly or in part a valuablesecurity (or anything signed or sealed and which is capable of being converted into avaluable security).14. When a sale deed is executed conveying a property claiming ownership thereto, itmay be possible for the purchaser under such sale deed, to allege that the vendor hascheated him by making a false representation of ownership and fraudulently inducedhim to part with the sale consideration. But in this case the complaint is not 77 of 153by the purchaser. On the other hand, the purchaser is made a co-accused. It is not thecase of the complainant that any of the accused tried to deceive him either by makinga false or misleading representation or by any other action or omission, nor is it hiscase that they offered him any fraudulent or dishonest inducement to deliver anyproperty or to consent to the retention thereof by any person or to intentionallyinduce him to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were notso deceived. Nor did the complainant allege that the first appellant pretended to bethe complainant while executing the sale deeds. Therefore, it cannot be said that thefirst accused by the act of executing sale deeds in favour of the second accused or thesecond accused by reason of being the purchaser, or the third, fourth and fifthaccused, by reason of being the witness, scribe and stamp vendor in regard to the saledeeds, deceived the complainant in any manner. As the ingredients of cheating asstated in section 415 are not found, it cannot be said that there was an offencepunishable under sections 417, 418, 419 or 420 of the Code.xxx xxx xxx It follows therefore that by merely alleging or showing that a person actedfraudulently, it cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable underthe Code or any other law, unless that fraudulent act is specified to be an offenceunder the Code or other law.xxx xxx xxx18. The averments in the complaint if assumed to be true, do not make out anyoffence under sections 420, 467, 471 and 504 of the Code, but may technically showthe ingredients of offences of wrongful restraint under section 341 and causing hurtunder section 323 of Indian Penal Code. 19. For the reasons stated above, the appealis allowed in part. The order of the High Court is set 78 of 153 aside. The order dated14.12.2005 of the learned Sub- Divisional Magistrate is quashed insofar as offencesunder sections 420, 467, 471 and 504 Indian Penal Code. Consequently, the chargesMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/44framed under those sections are also quashed. The order dated 14.12.2005 and thecharges in so far as the offence under sections 323 and 341 Indian Penal Code are leftundisturbed. The appeal is allowed in part accordingly."A perusal of the above judgment would show that the same was a case where an FIR had beenregistered on an application moved under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. on the allegations that the firstaccused who had no connection with the land nor entitled thereto, had executed two registered saledeeds in favour of the second accused. It was held that neither the offence of forgery was made outnor the complainant, who was the owner of the property, was entitled to get an FIR registered underSection 420 IPC. It has been held that in a case where a person has merely acted fraudulently, itcannot be assumed that he has committed an offence punishable under the Code unless thatfraudulent act is specified to be an offence under the Code or punishable under any other law. Afterexamining the provisions of Sections 463, 464, 467, 471 IPC and related provisions, it has beenobserved by the Hon'ble Apex Court that even in case a person dishonestly or fraudulently claims aproperty to be owned by him and knows that it is not his property and yet executes a sale deed, hecannot be stated to have made a false document so as to constitute the offence of forgery as it is notsufficient that the document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently and that inorder to constitute the offence of forgery, there is a further requirement that it should have beenmade with the intention of causing it to be believed that such a document was made or executed byor by the 79 of 153 authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was notmade or executed. It was further observed that when a document executed by a person claiming aproperty to be his, is not his, he is not claiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he isauthorized by someone else and thus, the execution of a document purported to convey someproperty of which he is not the owner, is not execution of false document as defined under Section464 of the Code and if, what is executed is not a false document then it cannot be said that forgeryhas been committed and thus, neither the offence under section 467 nor section 471 would getattracted. The above judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been followed by the Hon'bleSupreme Court in Sheila Sebastian's case (supra). The relevant parts of which are reproducedhereinbelow:-"The complainant alleges that, accused no. 1, (R. Jawaharaj), with the aid of animposter who by impersonating as Mrs. Doris Victor created a Power of Attorney(hereinafter 'PoA') in his name as if he was her agent. It was further alleged that,using the aforesaid PoA the accused no. 1, attempted to transfer the property ofcomplainant by executing a mortgage deed in favour of accused no. 2, (Rajapandi) fora sum of Rs.50,000/-. After getting the information about the aforesaid transaction,the owner of the property Mrs. Doris Victor gave a complaint to the police which wassubsequently registered as FIR dated 14.03.1998.xxx xxx xxx3. The learned Judicial Magistrate framed charges against accused no. 1 for thealleged offences punishable under Sections 420,423 and 465, IPC and against theaccused no. 2 for the offences under Sections 424 and 465 read with 109, IPC. BothMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/45the accused were tried by the learned Judicial Magistrate at Valliyoor in C.C. No:62/1999, wherein accused no. 1 was convicted under 80 of 153 Section 465, IPC andwas sentenced to undergo 2 years of simple imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and accused no. 2 was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for aperiod of 1 year and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/- for the offences under Section 465read with Section 109, IPC vide order dated 12.03.2003. 4. Aggrieved by the same,the Respondents-- Accused appealed before the Ld. Sessions Judge at Tirunelveli byway of Criminal Appeal Nos. 72 & 78 of 2003, which ended up in dismissal byupholding the order of conviction.xxx xxx xxx7. The counsel for the appellant submits that, the High Court failed to appreciate thematerial placed on record and acquitted the respondent solely on the basis that theirsignatures are not found on the forged document. According to the appellant, this isan erroneous interpretation of Section 464 of IPC which mandates that anyone whomakes a false document is guilty of forgery. The respondents allegedly created theforged power of attorney with the sole intention of grabbing the property belongingto Mrs. Doris Victor.xxx xxx xxx13. PW 4 (Ms. Latha) was the Sub Registrar when the accused persons came with theimposter for the registration of the Power of Attorney. During the registration, alongwith the imposter, accused no. 2 Rajapandi put his signature as a witness. The lefthand thumb impression of the imposter was maintained in the office of SubRegistrar. The original Power of Attorney was received by the accused no. 1Jawaharaj who put his signature on the same.xxx xxx xxx16. PW 8 (Mr. Albonse Xavier), a finger print recording inspector, has testified thatthe fingerprints present on 81 of 153 the alleged forged Power of Attorney do notmatch with that of Doris Victor.xxx xxx xxx19. A close scrutiny of the aforesaid provisions makes it clear that, Section 463defines the offence of forgery, while Section 464 substantiates the same by providingan answer as to when a false document could be said to have been made for thepurpose of committing an offence of forgery under Section 463, IPC. Therefore, wecan safely deduce that Section 464 defines one of the ingredients of forgery i.e.,making of a false document. Further, Section 465 provides punishment for thecommission of the offence of forgery. In order to sustain a conviction under SectionMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/46465, first it has to be proved that forgery was committed under Section 463, implyingthat ingredients under Section 464 should also be satisfied. Therefore unless anduntill ingredients under Section 463 are satisfied a person cannot be convicted underSection 465 by solely relying on the ingredients of Section 464, as the offence offorgery would remain incomplete 20. The key to unfold the present dispute lies inunderstanding Explanation 2 as given in Section 464 of IPC. As Collin J., puts itprecisely in Dickins v. Gill, (1896) 2 QB 310, a case dealing with the possession andmaking of fictitious stamp wherein he stated that "to make", in itself involvesconscious act on the part of the maker. Therefore, an offence of forgery cannot lieagainst a person who has not created it or signed it.xxx xxx xxx22. In Md. Ibrahim (supra), this Court had the occasion to examine forgery of adocument purporting to be a valuable security (Section 467, IPC) and using of forgeddocument as genuine (Section 471, IPC). While considering the basic ingredients ofboth the offences, this Court observed that to attract the offence of forgery as definedunder Section 463, IPC depends upon creation 82 of 153 of a document as definedunder Section 464, IPC. It is further observed that mere execution of a sale deed byclaiming that property being sold was executant's property, did not amount tocommission of offences punishable under Sections 467 and 471, IPC even if title ofproperty did not vest in the executant.xxx xxx xxx25. Keeping in view the strict interpretation of penal statute i.e., referring to rule ofinterpretation wherein natural inferences are preferred, we observe that a charge offorgery cannot be imposed on a person who is not the maker of the same. As held inplethora of cases, making of a document is different than causing it to be made. AsExplanation 2 to Section 464 further clarifies that, for constituting an offence underSection 464 it is imperative that a false document is made and the accused person isthe maker of the same, otherwise the accused person is not liable for the offence offorgery.26. The definition of "false document" is a part of the definition of "forgery". Bothmust be read together.xxx xxx xxx29. Although we acknowledge the appellant's plight who has suffered due to allegedacts of forgery, but we are not able to appreciate the appellant's contentions as apenal statute cannot be expanded by using implications. Section 464 of the IPCmakes it clear that only the one who makes a false document can be held liable underthe aforesaid provision. It must be borne in mind that, where there exists noMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/47ambiguity, there lies no scope for interpretation. The contentions of the appellant arecontrary to the provision and contrary to the settled law."A perusal of the above judgment would show that the same was a case where an imposter wasproduced for creating a power of attorney and 83 of 153 it was alleged that forged power of attorneyhad been prepared with the sole intention of grabbing the property of Doris Victor and even thefinger prints present on the alleged power of attorney did not match with that of Doris Victor(complainant therein) even so, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India upheld the acquittal of theaccused persons and after considering the ratio of law laid down in Md. Ibrahim's case (supra), heldthat the offence of forgery cannot lie against the person who has not created or signed the documentand for constituting offence under Section 464 IPC, it is imperative that a false document is madeand that the accused person is the maker of the said false document. Even the plight of the personwho had suffered due to the alleged act of forgery was noticed, but it was observed that a penalstatute cannot be expanded by use of implications.44. When applying the ratio of law laid down in the above said judgments to the facts of the presentcase, it would be apparent that even in case the allegations leveled in the complaint are taken on itsface value then also, offences under Sections 465, 467, 468 and 471 IPC are not made out. The caseof the petitioners is on the same footing as the case of the accused India in Md.Ibrahim's case(supra) and is on a higher footing than the case of the accused in Sheila Sebastien's case (supra). Thejudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court had considered Sections 467, 471 as well as Sections 464and 470. The present FIR has been registered under Section 465 and 468, in addition to the sectionswhich were under consideration in Md. Ibrahim's case (supra). Section 465 and Section 468 arereproduced hereinbelow:-"465. Punishment for forgery.--Whoever commits forgery shall be punished withimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or withfine, or with both.                              84 of 153                            Xxx     xxx     xxx468. Forgery for purpose of cheating.--Whoever commits forgery, intending that the[document or electronic record forged] shall be used for the purpose of cheating,shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which mayextend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine."A perusal of the above would show that in both the sections, i.e., Sections 465 and 468 IPC, the termforgery has been used. The definition of forgery is provided in Section 463. Section 463 starts withthe clause "whoever makes any false document". The definition of false document has been providedMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/48under Section 464. Thus, the principles of law laid down in Md.Ibrahim's case (supra) with respectto the offence under Sections 467, 471 IPC would also apply with respect to offences under Sections465 and 468 IPC.45. (I). Applying the above-stated principles to the allegations with respect to the documents allegedto be forged:i) C-9, C-10 and C-12 Learned counsel for respondent no.2 in order to make out a case for forgery,has relied upon C-9, C-10 and C-12 (annexed with the application/complaint under Section 156 (3)Cr.P.C. which has been placed on record as Annexure R-2/8 by respondent no.2). A perusal of thesaid documents would show that the same cannot be stated to be false documents so as to constitutethe offence of forgery. It is the case of respondent no.2 that Optum Inc., which is a US basedcompany, had issued certificates certifying that United Health Group Information Services PrivateLimited (UHGIS) had executed a turnkey project in the year 2009, which was stated to be on goingand it contained the name of 85 of 153 John Santelli, whose designation had been given as ChiefInformation Office, Optum and the date of issuance of the said document (C-9) has been mentionedas 14.02.2014. Further from the document C-9, reference has been made to the date ofcommencement of the project which is stated to be "since 2009". Even in the document C-10, whichis also a certificate issued by Optum Inc., American entity in favour of UHGIS, similar facts havebeen highlighted with the only difference being that in the said case, turnkey project is stated tohave started from the year 2008. Reference has also been made to C-12 to show that the documentstates that Optum Inc. was founded on 17.09.2009 and on the basis of the said document, it hasbeen argued that the said certificates are forged and fabricated. It has also been submitted that JohnSantelli is not the Chief Information Officer of Optum. With respect to the above aspect of forgery,reference has been made to paragraph 9 of the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. (page 542).This Court has considered the said argument raised by the learned counsel for respondent no.2 andis of the opinion that the offences under Sections 465, 467, 468 and 471 IPC will not be made out forthe following reasons:-1.1) Annexure C-12 annexed with the present application under Section 156 (3),cannot be stated tobe a document certifying the date of incorporation of Optum Inc. and does not inspire muchconfidence. 1.2) Even if the document C-12 is taken to be genuine and the argument of learnedcounsel for respondent no.2 to the effect that the said company i.e., Optum Inc was incorporated on17.09.2009, is taken on face value then also, a perusal of the documents C-9 and C-10 would showthat it has not even been alleged that the document was made or executed by some other person orby the authority of some other person by whom or 86 of 153 by whose authority it was not made orexecuted. In fact, as per the allegations made in paragraph 9 of the complaint (Page 452) it is thecase of the complainant himself that the said document has been prepared by John Santelli. JohnSantelli or any other person has not stated that the said document does not bear his signature. It isnot the case of the complainant that the said document shows that it has been made or signed by aperson who actually has not made or signed the same. 1.3) Respondent no.2 could not point outeven a single statement in the said documents which could be stated to be false. A perusal of thedocument would show that it has nowhere been stated that the project in the year 2009/2008,which was being executed by UHGIS, was being executed under Optum Inc. Learned counsel forMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/49respondent no.2 has not referred to any document to show that John Santelli was an employee ofUHGIS. At any rate, whether John Santelli is or is not the Chief Information Officer would not be arelevant factor to assess if offences under Sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 IPC have beenmade out or not.1.4) Even if all the allegations levelled by respondent no.2 are taken on face value, then also, since ithas not been alleged by respondent no.2 that any signatures on the documents / experiencecertificate have been forged or that the said document was made or executed by some other personor by the authority of some other person, by whom or by whose authority it has not been executed,the offence of forgery would not be made out. It is not even the allegation of respondent no.2 thatthere is any alteration much less, of any material part, without lawful authority or that the documenthas been executed dishonestly or fraudulently from a person of unsound mind or an intoxicatedperson or by using means of deception.87 of 153 As per the law laid down in Md. Ibrahim's case (supra), offence of forgery would becommitted in case a document is shown to be signed by "A" or by his authority and it isalleged/prima facie shown that it does not bear his signature or it is not by his authority. The sameis not the case of Respondent no. 2 and thus, offence of forgery is not made out. It would be furtherrelevant to mention that in the documents C-9 and C-10, the learned counsel for respondent no.2could not highlight any false averment. In the documents C-9 and C-10, it has nowhere been statedthat the projects had started in 2009 /2008 under the aegis of Optum Inc or that the Optum Inc wasconnected with the said project right from its inception. Thus, even if the Optum Inc wasincorporated on 17.09.2009 and there was a mention that UHGIS was carrying out a project sincethe year 2008/2009, then also, it cannot be stated that the said certificates bear false statements.The same can be best explained by the following example:- in a case where, a person "A" certifiesthat a person "B" has been working as a lawyer for the last 10 years in the office of "A" who, himselfhas been practicing as lawyer and that "B" had started practice with "A" and had been assisting himfrom the very first day of his practice, would be different from "A" certifying that "B" had beenworking as a lawyer for the last 10 years. In the former situation, if it is found that "A" himself hasbeen a lawyer only for the last 8 years, then it could be alleged that a false statement has been madeby "A" but however, the same cannot be stated to be a false statement in the latter situation as "A"had merely stated that "B" has been working as a lawyer for the last 10 years. The facts of thepresent case depict the latter position as has been stated above. Furthermore, even if there is a falsestatement in the said certificates C-9 and C-10, then also by applying the 88 of 153 law laid down bythe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Md.Ibrahim's case (supra), it cannot be stated that the saiddocuments are "false documents" as none of the ingredients as mentioned in paragraph 10 of thesaid judgment are even remotely made out.1.5) Further as per the judgment in Sheila Sebastian's case (supra), for constituting an offence underSection 464 IPC, it is imperative that there should be a false document and that the accused personshould be the maker of the false document and in case the said twin conditions are not met, then, aperson could not be stated to be liable for the offence of forgery. In the present case, apart from thefact that the documents in question cannot be said to be false document, none of the petitioners,other than John Santelli, as per the case of respondent no. 2, are the persons who had prepared theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/50said documents. It has not even been remotely alleged by respondent no.2 that John Santelli has notsigned the same or that his signatures are forged. Thus, no false document has been prepared withinthe meaning of Section 464 IPC and thus no offence under Sections 465, 467, 468 and 471 IPC ismade out. No other document has been alleged to be forged / fabricated by respondent no.2. 1.6) Inthe complaint/ application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in paragraph 2, reference has been made tothe order dated 20.03.2017, passed by the National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench atHyderabad and the same is annexed as Annexure C-2 along with the complaint/ application underSection 156 (3) Cr.P.C. The relevant portion of the said order is reproduced hereinbelow:-"BEFORE THE NATIONAL COMPANY LAWTRIBUNAL HYDERABAD BENCH AT HYDERABADCOMPANY PETITION Nos. 361 of 2016 CP (TCAA) Nos.34/HDB/2017 89 of 153 DATE OF ORDER:20.03.2017 In the Matter of Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) AND In the Matter of Scheme ofAmalgamation AND In the Matter of United Health Group Information Services Private Limited(Transferor Company) WITH In the Matter of Optum Global Solutions (India) Private Limited(Transferee Company) AND Their Respective Shareholders and Creditors xxx xxx xxx2.

Ltd. (UHGIS) was incorporated on 22.07.2002.The experience certificate in question states that the said company had commenced the projects inthe year 2008-09. Thus, the starting point of the said projects are subsequent to the date ofincorporation of the above said company, which is 22.07.2002. The transferee company in the abovesaid case in any case was Optum Global Solution India Limited (Optum India) and not Optum Inc(Optum US).46. (II). With respect to the allegations in the FIR to the effect that the bidder / petitioner-companydid not fulfill the requirement of clause 4.3 of volume II of the RFP, inasmuch as, it had not beenshown that they had a turnover of Rs.100 crore for the period of each relevant year i.e., 2008-09,2009-10 and 2010-11, the following points are required to be taken note of:-Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/512.1) The said allegation would not constitute any offence much less, the offence of forgery as there isno allegation to the effect that the balance sheet/ profit and loss accounts or any document withrespect to the same, have been forged and/or fabricated.2.2) The clause which contains the said condition, i.e., condition mentioned in para 4.3, has beenreproduced in paragraph 6 of the present complaint and the relevant portion of paragraph6 of thesaid complaint/application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. is reproduced hereinbelow:-"The Sr. No. 7 & 8 of para 4.3 (supra)(copy of the extract of tender documentcontaining the above relevant conditions embodies in their RFP Request for Proposalis annexed herewith as Annexure C-4:91 of 153a) The Bidder should have an annual turnover of at least Rs.100.

Instead the accused no.1, asalready stated, has produced 3 spurious' experience certificates', which, as assertedby the complainant are in any case fabricated."A perusal of the above would show that although, the said 100 crore turnover is required for thefinancial year 2010-13 but the allegations have been made with respect to years 2008-09, 2009-10and 2010-11. No allegation has been made with respect to the years 2011-12 and 2012-13. Theallegations made regarding 2008-09 and 2009-10 are thus, irrelevant. Respondent no.2 has placedon record Annexure R-2/8, which is stated to be copy of application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.along with the annexures and a perusal of the same would show that with respect to the statementsof profit and loss account for the year ending 31.03.2012, although pages containing up to note no.13have been annexed but the subsequent page, which contains the relevant note no.15, has not beenannexed. The petitioners have placed on record a complete copy of the said balance sheet, profit andloss accounts along with the auditor's report and the same is 92 of 153 Annexure P-32.

(III) Memorandum of Association With respect to the amendment in thememorandum of association, it is not the allegation of respondent no.2 that the saiddocuments have been forged or fabricated or that the resolution dated 29.04.2014 onthe basis of which, the said amendment has been made is a forged or a fabricateddocument. Thus, even with respect to the Memorandum of Association, no criminaloffence is made out.48. This Court has to now consider whether Sections 406, 409 and 420 IPC are attracted in thepresent case or not. Sections 405, 406, 409, 415 and 420 IPC are reproduced hereinbelow:-"Section 405 in The Indian Penal Code405. Criminal breach of trust.--Whoever, being in any manner entrusted withproperty, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates orconverts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that propertyin violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to bedischarged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touchingthe discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits"criminal breach of trust".94 of 153 Section 406 in The Indian Penal Code406. Punishment for criminal breach of trust.--Whoever commits criminal breach oftrust shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which mayextend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Section 409 in The Indian PenalCode409. Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant oragent.--Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with anydominion over property in his capacity of a public servant or in the way of hisbusiness as a banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent, commits criminalbreach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with 1[imprisonment forlife], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to tenyears, and shall also be liable to fine.Section 415 in The Indian Penal CodeMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/54415. Cheating.--Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestlyinduces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consentthat any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person sodeceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not sodeceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm tothat person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to "cheat". Explanation.--Adishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.Section 420 in The Indian Penal Code420. Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.--Whoever cheats andthereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to anyperson, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, oranything which is signed 95 of 153 or sealed, and which is capable of being convertedinto a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of either descriptionfor a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine."Criminal breach of trust, which is the necessary ingredient of Section 406 and 409 IPC, has beendefined in Section 405 IPC. The necessary ingredients of Section 405 IPC are detailed hereinbelow:-i) A person must be entrusted with a property or with dominion over any property.ii) The said person has to dishonestly misappropriate or convert to his own use that property ordishonestly use or dispose of that property in violation of any direction of law etc. In the presentcase, there is no allegation levelled in the complaint to the effect that the petitioners have beenentrusted with any property or dominion over any property and in pursuance of the entrustmenthave dishonestly misappropriated or converted the same to their own use or have dishonestly usedand disposed of the same in violation of any direction of law etc. Thus, the ingredients of Section405 IPC are not made out.Section 406 IPC only provides for punishment of offence under Section 405 and will come into playonly once the offence of criminal breach of trust is made out.Section 409 IPC stipulates the offence of criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker,merchant or agent. It has not been alleged by the complainant that any of the petitioners wereentrusted with property in their capacity as public servant or as banker, merchant, factor, broker,attorney or agent, thus, the said offence is not attracted to the facts of the present case. Argument oflearned counsel for respondent no.2 / complainant that the complainant was an employee of OptumIndia and 96 of 153 therefore, the said section is attracted is completely misconceived as firstly, theallegations in the application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. on the basis of which prayer has beenmade for the registration of an FIR, are with respect to the tender floated by HSHRC and not withrespect to the dispute between the company and respondent no.2, i.e., employer and ex-employee.Secondly, it is not even the case of respondent no.2 that he had entrusted any property etc. to thepetitioners which has been misappropriated.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/5549. With respect to the offence under Section 420 IPC, it is relevant to note that for the commissionof the said offence, there has to be cheating. The offence of cheating has been defined in Section 415.Necessary ingredients for the said offence of cheating have been detailed hereinbelow:-i) A person must deceive another person fraudulently or dishonestly.ii) A person so deceived must deliver any property to any person or to consent thatany person shall retain any property or intentionally induce the person so deceived todo or omit to do anything, which he would not do or omit if he was not so deceived.iii) Such act or omission would cause or is likely to cause damage or harm to thatperson in body, mind, reputation or property.It is not the case of respondent no.2 that the petitioners had deceived the complainant eitherfraudulently or dishonestly and had induced him to deliver any property to any person and such actor omission has caused any damage or harm to respondent no.2. The Hon'ble Supreme Court inMd.Ibrahim's case (supra) had observed that with respect to the offence of cheating, i.e., Section420, the person who has been cheated has to get the FIR registered and even in a case, where theowner of property had come to 97 of 153 the Court and had complained that his house had been soldby accused no.1 to accused no.2 therein, it had been observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court thatoffence under Section 420 IPC would not be made out as it was not the case of the complainanttherein that any of the accused tried to deceive him by making false or misleading representation orby any other action or omission, nor it was the case of the complainant therein that the accusedpersons made any fraudulent or dishonest inducement to deliver any property. Thus, the judgmentin Md.Ibrahim's case (supra) applies with full force to the facts of the present case. Even the offenceof cheating under Section 420 IPC is not made out on the allegation made in the complaint as perthe ratio of law in the said judgment. Moreover, it has been repeatedly held that Sections 406 and420 IPC are mutually destructive being anti-thesis of each other and thus, the registration of FIRunder both the provisions displays the non-application of mind during passing of the impugnedOrder.50. Ground no.3:Non-Compliance of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inPriyankaSrivastava's case (supra) and in Babu Venkatesh's case (supra) The law laid down by the Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) has not been followed inasmuch as,admittedly no complaint/application has been filed under Section 154(1) Cr.P.C. to the OfficerIncharge of the Police Station Sector 5, Panchkula in the present case nor the provisions of Section154(3) Cr.P.C. have been complied with as admittedly no complaint has been given to theSuperintendent of Police of the area concerned.Before coming to the facts of the present case, it is relevant to take a note of Section 154(1) and154(3) Cr.P.C. The relevant part of which is reproduced hereinbelow:-98 of 153 "Section 154(1) in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, (1) Every informationrelating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer inMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/56charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction,and be read Over to the informant; and every such information, whether given inwriting or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, andthe substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in suchform as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf.Section 154(3) in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, (3) Any person aggrieved by arefusal on the part of an officer in charge of a police station to record the informationreferred to in subsection (1) may send the substance of such information, in writingand by post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who, if satisfied that suchinformation discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, shall either investigatethe case himself or direct an investigation to be made by any police officersubordinate to him, in the manner provided by this Code, and such officer shall haveall the powers of an officer in charge of the police station in relation to that offence."51. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra), after considering allthe relevant provisions and other aspects, has held as under:-"1. The present appeal projects and frescoes a scenario which is not only disturbingbut also has the potentiality to create a stir compelling one to ponder in a perturbedstate how some unscrupulous, unprincipled and deviant litigants can ingeniously andinnovatively 99 of 153 design in a nonchalant manner to knock at the doors of theCourt, as if, it is a laboratory where multifarious experiments can take place and suchskillful persons can adroitly abuse the process of the Court at their own wild anddesire by painting a canvas of agony by assiduous assertions made in the applicationthough the real intention is to harass the statutory authorities, without any remoteremorse, with the inventive design primarily to create a mental pressure on the saidofficials as individuals, for they would not like to be dragged to a court of law to facein criminal cases, and further pressurise in such a fashion so that financial institutionwhich they represent would ultimately be constrained to accept the request for"one-time settlement" with the fond hope that the obstinate defaulters who hadborrowed money from it would withdraw the cases instituted against them. The facts,as we proceed to adumbrate, would graphically reveal how such persons,pretentiously aggrieved but potentially dangerous, adopt the self- convincing masterymethods to achieve so. That is the sad and unfortunate factual score forming thefulcrum of the case at hand, and, we painfully recount.xxx xxx xxx29. At this stage it is seemly to state that power under Section 156(3) warrantsapplication of judicial mind. A court of law is involved. It is not the police taking stepsat the stage of Section 154 of the code. A litigant at his own whim cannot invoke theauthority of the Magistrate. A principled and really grieved citizen with clean handsmust have free access to invoke the said power. It protects the citizens but whenMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/57pervert litigations takes this route to harass their fellows citizens, efforts are to bemade to scuttle and curb the same.100 of 15330. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country where Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicantwho seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in anappropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth andalso can verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicantmore responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are beingfiled in a routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to harasscertain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one triesto pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision which can bechallenged under the framework of said Act or under Article 226 of the Constitutionof India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal court as ifsomebody is determined to settle the scores.31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications under Section154(1) and 154(3) while filing a petition under Section 156(3). Both the aspects shouldbe clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to that effect shall befiled. The warrant forgiving a direction that an the application under Section 156(3)be supported by an affidavit so that the person making the application should beconscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is because oncean affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance withlaw. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate underSection 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same canalso be verified by the learned Magistrate, regard being had to the nature ofallegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining tofiscal sphere, 101 of 153 matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences,medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormaldelay/ laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari arebeing filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would also be aware of the delay inlodging of the FIR.xxx xxx xxx35. A copy of the order passed by us be sent to the learned Chief Justices of all theHigh Courts by the Registry of this Court so that the High Courts would circulate thesame amongst the learned Sessions Judges who, in turn, shall circulate it among thelearned Magistrates so that they can remain more vigilant and diligent whileexercising the power under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C."Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/58A perusal of the above-reproduced provisions as well as the above-said judgment would show that ithas been mandated under Section 154(1) of the Code that every information relating to thecommission of a cognizable offence is to be given to the officer Incharge of the police station havingjurisdiction. In the present case, the said officer Incharge would be Incharge of Police Station Sector5, Panchkula as has been admitted by the all the contesting parties. It has further been provided inSection 154(3) Cr.P.C. that any person who is aggrieved by refusal on the part of the police in chargeof a Police Station to record the information referred to in sub section (1) may send the substance ofsuch information, in writing and by post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who, in case issatisfied that such information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, has the power toinvestigate the case himself or to direct an investigation. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in theabove said judgment, after noticing a 102 of 153 trend of frivolous applications being filed underSection 156(3) Cr.P.C. as a matter of routine and without even first complying with the mandatoryprovisions of Section 154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C., has observed that the power under Section 156(3)C.r.P.C. warrants application of judicial mind since a court of law is involved in the same and alitigant, at his own whim, cannot invoke the authority of the Magistrate and when litigators take thisroute to harass their fellows citizens, efforts are to be made to scuttle and curb the same. It wasfurther directed that it would be mandatory to first comply with the stipulations under Sections154(1) and 154(3) before filing an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and both the said aspectsshould be clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents in support of this aspect arealso to be filed. It was further directed that application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. should besupported by an affidavit so that in case, the averments made in the complaint are found to be falsethen the complainant could be prosecuted in accordance with law. The same would also help andassist the Magistrate in becoming aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR. The copy of the saidjudgment was ordered to be circulated amongst learned Magistrates all over the country so that theycould remain more vigilant and diligent while exercising their powers under Section 156(3). The saidjudgment had been passed prior to the passing of the said impugned order.52. The judgment in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) has been followed by the Hon'ble SupremeCourt of India in judgment dated 18.02.2022 passed in Criminal Appeal no.252 of 2022 titled asBabu Venkatesh's case and connected matters in which case the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India hasheld as under:-103 of 153 "25. This court has clearly held that, a stage has come where applicationsunder section 156 (3) of Cr.P.C., 1973 are to be supported by an affidavit duly swornby the complainant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.26. This court further held that, in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate wouldbe well advised to verify the truth and also verify the veracity of the allegations. Thecourt has noted that, applications under section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 are filedin a routine manner without taking any responsibility only to harass certain persons.27. This court has further held that, prior to the filing of a petition under section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 there have to be applications under section 154 (1) and 154 (3)of the Cr.P.C., 1973 This court emphasizes the necessity to file an affidavit so that theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/59persons making the application should be conscious and not make false affidavit.With such a requirement, the persons would be deterred from causally invokingauthority of the Magistrate, under section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C. In as much as if theaffidavit is found to be false, the person would be liable for prosecution in accordancewith law.28. In the present case, we find that the learned Magistrate while passing the orderunder section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 has totally failed to consider the law laiddown by this court.29. From the perusal of the complaint it can be seen that, thecomplainant/respondent No. 2 himself has made averments with regard to the filingof the Original Suit. In any case, when the complaint was not supported by anaffidavit, the Magistrate ought not to have entertained the application under section156 (3) of the Cr.P.C., 1973 The High Court has also failed to take into considerationthe legal position as has been enunciated by this court in the case of PriyankaSrivastava v. State 104 of 153 of U.P. (supra), and has dismissed the petitions bymerely observing that serious allegations are made in the complaint.30. We are, therefore, of the considered view that, continuation of the presentproceedings would amount to nothing but an abuse of process of law.31. We therefore, allow these appeals and set-aside the judgments and orders of theHigh Court dated 22nd January 2021, passed in Criminal Petition Nos. 6719/2020,6729/2020, 6733/2020 and 6737/2020. Consequently, the FIR Nos. 255/2019,256/2019 filed on 16th December, 2019, FIR No. 257/2019 filed on 17th December,2019 and FIR No. 258/2019 filed on 18th December, 2019 registered with JayanagarPolice Station, Bengaluru City are quashed and set aside. Pending application(s), ifany, shall stand disposed of."A perusal of the above-reproduced judgment would show that it has been reiterated that theprovisions of Section 154(1) and 154(3)C.r.P.C. are necessarily required to be complied with, prior tothe filing of the application/complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and even the affidavit isnecessarily required to be filed and since the Magistrate while passing the order under Section156(3) Cr.P.C. had failed to consider the law laid down in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) andeven the High Court had failed to take into consideration the legal position, thus, the appeals wereallowed and the criminal proceedings were quashed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.53. With respect to the above-said aspect, learned counsel for respondent no.2 has very fairlysubmitted that no complaint/application has been filed in the present case to the Officer Incharge ofthe Police Station or even to the Superintendent of Police as has been envisaged under Sections154(1) or 154(3) Cr.P.C.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/60105 of 153 The fact that even the Chief Judicial Magistrate had not considered the non-complianceof the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme court in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) case is apparentfrom the various zimni orders which were passed by the Court prior to the passing of impugnedorder and which have been placed on record by Respondent no. 2 in his reply.

Now, to come upon 15.12.2021 for consideration.109 of 153 (Nitin Raj) CJM/PKL HRO287 Date of Order: 23.11.2021"A perusal of the above zimni orders would show that although at the time of passing order dated31.08.2021, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula, had specifically noticed the judgment of DelhiHigh Court which required the Magistrate to ensure that before coming to the Court, thecomplainant approached the police officer Incharge of the Police Station having jurisdiction over thearea for recording the information available with him disclosing the cognizable offence and alsoshould examine as to what action has been taken by the SHO or even by the officer under Section154(3) Cr.P.C. but however, the subsequent zimni orders as well as the impugned order would showthat no observation had been made with respect to any complaint having been filed by respondentno.2 to the officer Incharge of concerned police station, i.e. Sector 5 Panchkula or to theSuperintendent of Police, nor any reference has been made as to what action has been taken in caseany such complaint had been filed. Even a perusal of the application under Section 156(3) of theCr.P.C. would show that there is no reference to any complaint/application filed under Section154(1) or under Section 154(3) and thus, the impugned order as well as subsequent proceedingsincluding registration of the FIR, deserve to be set aside /quashed on the said ground alone, being inblatant violation of the ratio of law laid down in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) followed in BabuVenkatesh's case (supra).54. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has attempted to overcome the said legal objection raisedagainst him by stating that he had made a complaint to the Director General of Police dated11.02.2020 (P-24) (page 110 of 153508) and further submitted that the said report percolated down to the Economic Offences Wing,which had submitted its interim report dated 01.09.2020 and the same has been taken note of in theimpugned order. The said aspect even if taken to be true, cannot be considered to be strictcompliance of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava's case(supra). Admittedly, no complaint/application has been filed under Section 154(1) or 154(3) of theCode, to the concerned Officer Incharge / Police Station although, several complaints have beenmade to several forums/authorities both in Delhi and Haryana. Even the complaint which has beenfiled before the Director General of Police, Haryana, (P-24) (Page 508) is a complaint in whichoffence under Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was also alleged to have beencommitted and in the said complaint prayer has been made that action be taken against theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/64delinquent / erring officials of the Haryana State Health Resource Centre, Government of Haryana.In the present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., allegations under Section 13 of thePrevention of Corruption Act have not been mentioned and thus, there are material differences inthe said two complaints and the complaint to the DGP cannot be considered to be compliance of theprovisions under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C. In paragraph 3 of the impugned order, it hasbeen noticed that the report dated 01.09.2020 was submitted by the Economic Offence Wing andnot the Officer Incharge of Police Station Sector 5, Panchkula under Section 154(3) Cr.P.C.Moreover, the said report was an interim report which was superseded by the final report dated09.10.2020 which was not taken into consideration in the impugned order.111 of 15355. Before parting with this part of the order, it would be appropriate to deal with the judgmentscited by learned counsel for respondent no.2 on the said aspect.The first judgment upon which reliance has been placed by respondent no. 2 is the judgment of aSingle Bench of Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Gulam Mohi-ud-Din's case (supra) on the basisof the said judgment it has been contended by learned counsel for respondent no.2 that even in casecompliance of law laid down Priyanka Srivastava' case (supra) has not been made then also, theproceeding arising therefrom ought not be quashed. The said judgment is in the teeth of law laiddown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) which wassubsequently followed in Babu Venkatesh's case (supra). This Court is bound by the law laid downby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Further, even a perusal of the said judgment of the SingleBench of Jammu and Kashmir High Court would show that in the said case it was observed that theoffences stood established against the accused persons therein and there was no material to showthat the complaint / FIR which was registered was malafide, frivolous or vexatious and nor it wasthe case of the accused therein that the complainant had concealed material facts.Further, reliance has been placed by respondent no.2 on the judgment of the Full Bench of BombayHigh Court in Mr. Panchabhai Popotbhai Butani's case (supra). At the outset, it is noted that thesaid judgment was delivered on 10.12.2009 and the same was prior to the judgment of the Hon'bleSupreme Court of India in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra). The law laid down in the saidjudgment would also not support the argument of learned counsel for respondent no.2. It was heldin the said judgment that normally a person should invoke the provisions of Section 154 112 of 153 of the Code before recourse is taken to the power of the Magistrate competent to take cognizanceunder Section 190 of the Code by filing an application under Section 156(3) of the Code and at leastintimation was required to be given to the police under Section 154(1) of the Code, which would be acondition precedent for invocation of powers of the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code. Inthe said case, although it was observed that the said dictum of law is not free from exception andthere could be cases where non-compliance of the above-said provisions would not divest themagistrate of his jurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3) Cr.P.C and there could be cases where thepolice fails to act instantly and the facts of the case show that there is a possibility of the evidence ofcommission of the offence being destroyed or an applicant could approach the magistrate directly byway of an exception. Even as per the said judgment, the mandate is to comply with the provisionsMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/65Sections 154(1) and 154(3). Nothing has been shown by the respondent no.2 so as to bring his casewithin the exceptions as mentioned in the judgment, rather the applicant-respondent no.2 has filedone complaint after another including an earlier application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. beforeRohini Courts, New Delhi. At any rate, it is the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court which isthe law of the land and has to be followed and adhered to by all the High Courts.56. The third judgment relied upon by learned counsel for respondent no.2 on the above aspect isthe judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sakiri Vasu's case (supra). The relevant paras 9, 10 and11 of the said judgment are reproduced hereinbelow:-"9. The petitioner (appellant herein) prayed in the writ petition that the matter beordered to be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in short'CBI').Since 113 of 153 his prayer was rejected by the High Court, hence this appeal byway of special leave.10. It has been held by this Court in CBI & another v. Rajesh Gandhi and another,1997 Cr.L.J63 (vide para 8) that no one can insist that an offence be investigated by aparticular agency. We fully agree with the view in the aforesaid decision. Anaggrieved person can only claim that the offence he alleges be investigated properly,but he has no right to claim that it be investigated by any particular agency of hischoice.11. In this connection we would like to state that if a person has a grievance that thepolice station is not registering his FIR under Section 154 Criminal Procedure Code,then he can approach the Superintendent of Police under Section 154(3) CriminalProcedure Code by an application in writing. Even if that does not yield anysatisfactory result in the sense that either the FIR is still not registered, or that evenafter registering it no proper investigation is held, it is open to the aggrieved personto file an application under Section 156(3) Criminal Procedure Code before thelearned Magistrate concerned. If such an application under Section 156(3) is filedbefore the Magistrate, the Magistrate can direct the FIR to be registered and also candirect a proper investigation to be made, in a case where, according to the aggrievedperson, no proper investigation was made. The Magistrate can also under the sameprovision monitor the investigation to ensure a proper investigation."A perusal of the above judgment would show that even as per the same, it had been stated that anapplication is to be made before the Police Station under Section 154(1) and in case, FIR has notbeen registered, the complainant should approach the Superintendent of Police under Section 114 of153 154(3) and only thereafter, an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. could be filed. The saidobservations made are in consonance with the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in PriyankaSrivastava's case (supra) and Babu Venkatesh's case (supra) which are sought to be relied upon bylearned senior counsel for the petitioner and do not in any way further the case of respondent no.2Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/6657. Ground no. 4: Infirmities/illegalities in the Impugned Order The impugned order dated15.12.2021 has been passed on the basis of interim reports without considering the final reportthereon and without considering the earlier application filed under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in RohiniCourts, Delhi and also other important aspects. The impugned order, apart from the grounds whichhave been stated hereinabove, also deserves to be set aside on account of the following factors:-(i) In paragraph 4 of the impugned order, reliance has been sought to be placed onthe interim report dated 22.07.2020,prepared by respondents no.3 and 4. Theimpugned order does not take into consideration the fact that ultimately as per thereport dated 22.07.2020, the recommendations which were made (Page 501) are asfollows:-"Recommendation1.

It was also observed that respondentno.2/complainant himself was very much involved in the bidding process as he wasvisible in the video of the proceedings and there was no sufficient evidence to proveany corrupt act or criminal breach of trust or that the said certificates were forgedand fabricated or there was any issue regarding balance sheet or profit and lossaccount which was examined by the finance and legal experts and ultimately, thecomplaint was filed. The relevant portion of the report/letter dated 12.01.2021 isreproduced hereinbelow:-"3. Accordingly, a Committee of two officers from the O/o HARTRON examined thetender document and other relevant documents to conclude in the matter ofcorruption and irregularities committed in grant of tender floated by HSHRC forimplementation of HIS.

Sh. Rahul Mathur, Sr. General Manager, NISG The said Joint Committeedeliberated upon the issues mentioned in the complaint while conducting fourmeetings. All the members were provided all the relevant documents pertaining tothe matter via e-mail/ hard copies/ pen drives etc. The video recordings of the tenderprocess/ representations were also made available to the members. In the 4thmeeting of the Joint Committee, all the members submitted their individual reportsafter perusal of which the Chairman also submitted his own report.After going through all the documents available on file and the reports of all themembers (12 in number) of the Joint Committee, it is drawn that the committeecouldn't find any act of omission or commission on the part of bid evaluationcommittee. Following are some of the worth mentioning points which form the basisof conclusion:xxx xxx xxx6. The complainant was very much involved the bidding process as he is visible invideo and his signatures are there as witnessed while signing the MoU, He waspresent when the matter was taken up in High Powered Purchase Committee meetingheld on 2.7.14.119 of 153 The meeting was presided over by the then Finance Minister and had thethen Education Minister, ACS Industries, ACS Health, DG MER, Director Supplies &Disposal, ED HSHRC and many other senior officers of the Govt.7. The complainant has not given sufficient evidences that why and how he isjustifying his claims of the 16- member committee being corrupt or has committedcriminal breach of trust or causing wrongful and huge financial loss to theex-chequer. His allegations w.r.t. UHG experience certificates being false andfabricated ones or w.r.t UHG balance sheets or profit& loss statements etc. areexamined in detail by financial experts and legal experts of the Joint Committee,namely, Sh. Harkesh Anand CA, Smt Asha Hooda CS, Smt.Renu Pathania LO. whosereports were also considered while finalizing the report.8. Besides financial and law experts, other members of this inquiry committee havealso given their reports which were also considered while finalizing the report.Thus, based on the reports of all the members and based on above conclusive points,it is prayed that a client (Haryana Govt.) should not be made a party of the disputebetween employer and ex employee and hence, the complaint may be filed.Director General Health Services-cum-CVO Health Department, Haryana"Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/70As is apparent from the zimni orders, which have been reproduced in the earlier partof the judgment, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula had called for the entirerecord and thus, to selectively reproduce portions of the interim report dated22.07.2020, without taking into consideration the final recommendation by the saidcommittee, and also non-120 of 153 consideration of the observations made in the letter dated 12.01.2021 hasresulted in a serious illegality in the impugned order.ii) A perusal of the impugned order would show that it has not even been remotely observed that inthe present case there is compliance of the statutory provisions of Section 154(1) and 154(3) Cr.P.C.and the judgment of Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court ofIndia.iii) In paragraph 8 of the impugned order, it has been observed that respondent no.2 was alsoinvolved in the bidding process on behalf of accused no.1-company and the Court had thus, takencognizance of the report dated 22.07.2020 of respondents no.3 and 4. Apart from the above fact thatrecommendations made in the said report had not been seen and the letter dated 12.01.2021 asstated hereinabove had also not been taken note of, it is also relevant to note that even respondentno.2 had challenged the impugned order dated 15.12.2021 before the Sessions Judge, Panchkula byfiling a criminal revision and the same has been annexed with the reply as Annexure R-2/7. Theprayer clause in the said revision petition is reproduced hereinbelow:-"It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to call forthe records of the Ld.

The same clearly shows that the plea of respondent no.2 to the effect thathe is a whistleblower, is completely farcical and respondent no.2 only intended to extract money outof the petitioners and wanted to harass the petitioners on account of the fact that he was made toresign from the petitioner-company after the illegalities committed by him were brought to surface.122 of 153iv) A perusal of the paragraph 2 of the impugned order would show that the Chief JudicialMagistrate, Panchkula had been impressed by the observation of the Hon'ble High Court in theorder dated 26.07.2021, which have been highlighted in the impugned order. The Chief JudicialMagistrate, Panchkula, has failed to take note of the fact that the said petition had been withdrawnand even an earlier petition filed before this Hon'ble Court had also been dismissed as withdrawn.Thus, the prayer of respondent no.2 to the effect that an FIR be registered / SIT be constituted, hadnot been granted by the Coordinate Benches of this Court. The portion of the order which had beenhighlighted by the CJM, Panchkula in the impugned order were submissions made by learned seniorcounsel appearing for the respondent no.2 herein before the Coordinate Bench of this Court and thesame was not the finding / observation of the Hon'ble Court. A perusal of the said order dated26.07.2021 (Annexure P-26) (Page 537) would show that neither the counsel for the State nor anycounsel for the present petitioners had appeared in the said matter. Although, the said order waspassed on 26.07.2021 but respondent no.2 had not brought it to the notice of the High Court thatthe interim report dated 01.09.2020 of the Economic Offence Wing had merged into the final reportdated 19.10.2020 and even the factum of letter dated 12.01.2021 (P-23) (Page 503) was not broughtto the notice of the Hon'ble High Court.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/72(v) Reliance sought to be placed in the impugned order upon Paragraph 3 of the report dated01.09.2020, is also misconceived inasmuch as, firstly the same is by the Economic Offences Wingand not by the officer Incharge of the Police Station concerned. Secondly, even as per the saidreport, Inspector Rajeev of the Economic Offence Wing had submitted the 123 of 153 same to thesenior officers for further orders.

The relevantpart of para 5 of the reply / brief submission by respondent no.2 is reproduced hereinbelow:-"It shall be pertinent to place on record the orders of the Ld. CJM, Panchkula,whereby the complaint case of the 125 of 153 respondent no.2 here was listed on 7occasions. Over a span of 3months as the Ld.

Court of the CJM, Panchkula) from the concernedgovernment departments and after his own satisfaction has passed perfectly legalorder of directing the Police to register the FIR. A copy of zimni orders is collectivelyannexed herewith as Annexure R2/2.)"It was only respondent no.2 or his counsel who were aware as to what transpired during the aboveproceedings as neither the petitioners nor their counsel was present in the said proceeding. Theaverments made in the said paragraphs raise another issue, which has been highlighted by learnedsenior counsel for the petitioners, to the effect that under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., the Court was onlyrequired to see whether cognizable offence is made out or not and in order to see compliance of theprovisions of Sections 154(1) and 154(3), the CJM, Panchkula was required to only call for thereports from the concerned police station, i.e. Sector 5, Panchkula and in case, the averments madeby respondent no.2 in the reply hereinabove are taken on face value, then, it is apparent that theCJM, Panchkula had made an inquiry in the matter himself and even the record was not madeavailable to counsel for the complainant and thus, the CJM, Panchkula had moved from Chapter XIIof Cr.P.C. to Chapter XV of Cr.P.C. and once, the Court had decided to conduct the inquiry itself,then the Court could not have resorted to the provisions under Chapter XII and order theregistration of the FIR. Once the inquiry had been made then the Court should have proceeded inaccordance with the subsequent provisions as contained in 126 of 153 Chapter XV. Although, in viewof the facts of the present case, it cannot be affirmatively stated that the Magistrate had moved toChapter XV of Cr.P.C., but keeping in view the averments made in paragraph 5 of the reply filed byrespondent no.2, it is apparent that the procedure adopted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,Panchkula was not in consonance with law.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/7458. It would now be relevant to note the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel forrespondent no.2 with respect to the above aspects. The first judgment relied upon by the learnedcounsel for respondent no.2 is the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Punjab vs.Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar's case (supra). The said judgment would in fact support the propositionthat if initial action is not in consonance with law then all consequential proceedings including FIRetc., must fail. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-"105. The FIR unquestionably is an inseparable corollary to the impugned orderswhich are a nullity. Therefore, the very birth of the FIR, which is a direct consequenceof the impugned orders cannot have any lawful existence. The FIR itself is based on apreliminary enquiry which in turn is based on the affidavits submitted by theapplicants who had filed the petitions under Section 482 CrPC.106. The order impugned has rightly been challenged to be a nullity at least on threegrounds, namely, judicial bias; want of jurisdiction by virtue of application of theprovisions of Section 362Criminal Procedure Code coupled with the principles ofconstructive res judicata; and the Bench had not been assigned the roster to entertainpetitions under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code. The entire judicial processappears to have been drowned to achieve a motivated result which we are unable toapprove of.127 of 153107. It is a settled legal proposition that if initial action is not in consonance with law,all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall through for the reason thatillegality strikes at the root of the order. In such a fact-situation, the legal maxim"sublato fundamento cadit opus" meaning thereby that foundation being removed,structure/work falls, comes into play and applies on all scores in the present case.108. In Badrinath v. State of Tamil Nadu &Ors., 2000(4) S.C.T. 832 ; and State ofKerala v. Puthenkavu N.S.S. Karayogam & Anr., (2001) 10 SCC 191 , this Courtobserved that once the basis of a proceeding is gone, all consequential acts, actions,orders would fall to the ground automatically and this principle is applicable tojudicial, quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings equally.109. Similarly in Mangal Prasad Tamoli (dead) by Lrs. v. Narvadeshwar Mishra(dead) by Lrs. &Ors., (2005) 3 SCC 422 , this Court held that if an order at the initialstage is bad in law, then all further proceedings, consequent thereto, will be non estand have to be necessarily set aside.110. In C. Albert Morris v. K. Chandrasekaran &Ors., 2005(4) RCR (Civil) 603 :2005(2) RCR(Rent) 498 : (2006) 1 SCC 228 , this Court held that a right in law existsonly and only when it has a lawful origin.(See also: Upen Chandra Gogoi v. State ofAssam &Ors., 1998(2) S.C.T. 235 : (1998) 3SCC 381 ; Satchidananda Misra v. State ofMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/75Orissa &Ors., 2004(4) S.C.T. 221 : (2004) 8SCC 599 ; Regional Manager, SBI v.Rakesh Kumar Tewari, 2006(1) S.C.T. 451 : (2006) 1SCC 530 ; and Ritesh Tewari&Anr. v. State of U.P. &Ors., AIR 2010 Supreme Court3823).76. Thus, in view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the ordersimpugned being a nullity, cannot be sustained. As a consequence, subsequentproceedings/ 128 of 153 orders/ FIR / investigations and automatically vitiated andare liable to be declared non est."A perusal of the above judgment would show that if initial action is not in consonance with law, thenall such consequential proceedings would fail since, illegality strikes at the root of the order. It wasfurther observed that since the impugned order could not be sustained, the subsequent orders / FIR/ investigation would stand automatically vitiated and liable to be declared non est. The saidprinciple would in fact support the case of the petitioners inasmuch as, on several legal counts, theimpugned order and the FIR deserve to be set aside / quashed and necessarily all proceedings inrelation to the same would also stand set aside / quashed.On the basis of the above said judgment, learned counsel for respondent no.2 has argued that thisCourt has power to refer the matter to CBI, with respect to the said aspect it would be relevant tonote that the matter is already pending before the Lokayukta, Haryana. Even the proceedings foracceptance/non-acceptance of the cancellation report in the FIR registered by Respondent no.2 inDelhi is pending in which, no objection/protest petition has been filed by respondent no.2. Thepresent case is not even remotely a case which ought to be referred to the CBI and in fact, a perusalof the complaint would show that no cognizable offence is made out even if the allegations in theFIR are taken to be true. This Court has further found that entire proceedings are malafide,malicious and have been instituted with an ulterior motive. It is also being observed that respondentno.2 has been found to be indulging in forum shopping. Moreover, as per the observations made bythe Hon'ble Supreme Court, the matter is only to be referred to the CBI in case, the investigation hasbeen 129 of 153 conducted in a biased manner and only in exceptional circumstances. Although,respondent no.2 has challenged the impugned order by filing his own criminal revision but the sameis a limited challenge as it has been prayed in the same that respondent no. 2 be continued as thecomplainant. Thus, the observations made on the said aspect by the Hon'ble Supreme Court wouldnot apply in the present case. In view of the law laid down in the said judgment, the same wouldfurther the case of the present petitioners rather than the case of respondent no. 2.59. Reliance has also been placed upon by respondent no.2 on the judgment of Hon'ble SupremeCourt of India in Kaptan Singh's case (supra). The said case also does not further the case ofrespondent no.2 inasmuch as, in the said case, apart from the other factors, the complainant in thesaid case was beaten up with fist blows and one of the accused therein who was carrying a knife likeweapon, kept the "edged" part of it on the chest of the complainant and threatened him to sign thedocument failing which, he threatened to kill him and in the said case, the complainant alsoproduced a medical report in support of his allegations. In the said case, apart from Section 406IPC, FIR was under Sections 329, 386, 147, 148, 149, IPC. Further, allegations were made that adocument which was alleged to have been executed by Munni Devi in favour of Mamta Gupta wasMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/76forged and fabricated. The High Court had observed that Section 406 IPC could not be made outand the rest of the allegations being tangent to the main allegation were also quashed. It wasobserved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that there was serious triable issue including the issue offorgery of document which was executed between the parties and the question whether thedocument had been duly executed or not was even observed to be seriously disputed before the HighCourt and thus, in view of the above, the 130 of 153 order passed by the High Court quashing theproceedings were set aside. No legal arguments, as have been raised in the present petition, wereraised by the accused in the above-said case.60. Further, reliance has been placed by learned counsel for respondent no. 2 upon the judgment ofHon'ble Supreme Court of India in M/s Neeharika Infrastructure's case (supra). In the said case, aninterim order to the effect that "no coercive measures shall be adopted" was passed by the HighCourt without giving any reason, while the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was kept pending. Itwas the said interim order which had been challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and it washighlighted that apart from there being no reasons given in the said order, the same would result ina blanket direction to the investigating officer restraining him from taking coercive measures. In thesaid case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deprecated the practice of passing of order of "nocoercive steps" and that too without giving any reason. Even while setting aside the said order, it hadbeen observed that in a case where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed in theFIR, the Court may not permit the investigation to go on and further observed that the Court in casethinks it fit having regard to the parameters of quashing as laid down in various judgmentsincluding State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others, reported as 1992 Supp(1) SupremeCourt Cases 335, the Courts were vested with the jurisdiction to quash the FIR/complaint. It wasstated that the said parameters would also be considered in case interim order is to be passed buthowever, the interim order is to be passed only in exceptional circumstances and that too, by givingreasons for the same and by clearly stating as to why the interim order has been passed. In thepresent case, there is no challenge to any such order granting "no coercive action" and thus, the 131of 153 said judgment would not apply to the present case. In fact, it would be relevant to state that atthe time when the present petition first came up for hearing, learned senior counsel for thepetitioners had strongly prayed for grant of such an interim relief but this Court thought itappropriate to decide the entire matter, with the consent of all the parties and while doing so, thisCourt was conscious of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s NeeharikaInfrastructure's case (supra).61. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has also placed reliance upon the judgment of Hon'bleSupreme Court in HDFC Securities Ltd.'s case (supra) and the same also does not further the case ofrespondent no.2 in any manner. The arguments raised in the said case to challenge the proceedingsunder Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. were completely different from the argument raised by learned counselfor respondent no.2 in the present case. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had observedthat after considering all the facts, it had been found that the complaint disclosed the commission ofcognizable offence. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-"11. The scope of Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. came up for consideration before this Courtin several cases. This Court in Maksud Saiyed case examined the requirement of theMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/77application of mind by the Magistrate before exercising jurisdiction under Section156(3) and held that where jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint filed in terms ofSection 156(3) or Section 200 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate is required to apply his mind, insuch a case, the Special Judge/Magistrate cannot refer the matter under Section156(3) against a public servant without a valid sanction order. The application ofmind by the Magistrate should be reflected in the order."132 of 153 The above said observation would not further the case of respondent no.2in any manner.Reliance has also been placed upon by respondent no.2 on the judgment of Mosiruddin Munshi'scase (supra) and the same also would not further the case of respondent no.2. In the said case, thesole argument which was raised by the accused therein was that the dispute was a civil dispute andthus, the FIR should not have been registered. None of the arguments as have been raised by thepresent petitioners in the present case were raised in the cited judgment. It was further observed bythe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that keeping in view the averments made in the complainttherein, it could very well be made out that there was a fraudulent/ dishonest inducement made byaccused no.1 and 2 therein in pursuance of which, the complainant therein had parted with money.It was further observed that the accused no.2 therein did not even have title over the property as hehad no registered document in his favour and there were allegations that both the accused haveentered into a criminal conspiracy and had cheated the complainant who had parted with moneyand thus, the complaint prima facie made out a case which required further investigation. The factsof the said case are thus, clearly different from the facts of the present case.62. The above-noted factors in addition to the fact that earlier complaints had already been filed inDelhi and the reports in pursuance of the same as well as earlier proceedings under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. filed in Delhi Courts as well as the orders passed thereto, having been concealed from theChief Judicial Magistrate, Panchkula, thus, calls for setting aside of the impugned order.133 of 15363. Ground no. 5: Delay in filing the present application u/s 156(3) Cr.P.C.The present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. has been filed on 27.08.2021. A perusal of theParagraph 26 (page 547) as well as Paragraph 39 (page 550) of the present application filed underSection 156 (3) Cr.P.C. would show that even as per the case of respondent no.2, he acquiredknowledge with respect to the alleged illegalities and commission of offences during the biddingprocess, on 01.10.2015, from accused no.2- Sandeep Khurana who, in a drunken state had disclosedall the facts to respondent no.2. However, application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. has been filedafter a delay of more than 5 years and 9 months from the date respondent no.2 gained knowledgequa the alleged incident.64. Ground no.6: Non-challenge to the tender proceedings and the Award in favour of thepetitioner-company, by the four companies which had participated in the tender process along withMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/78the petitioner-company.In the present case, the allegations levelled stem from the alleged illegalities committed in thetender process. It is pertinent to note that none of the competitors who had participated in thebidding process have challenged the tender process or the award of tender to the petitionerno.1-company. A perusal of paragraph 12 of the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. wouldshow that as per respondent no.2 apart from the petitioner company, there were four othercompetitors which were as follows:-"S.No. Company Name1. IL& FS Technologies Limited2. Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Limited3. Accenture Services Pvt. Ltd.4. EY/NDSL"134 of 153 It is the admitted case of the parties concerned that none of the said four companies,which are well established companies, have challenged the bidding process and in case, there wereany illegalities committed in the bidding process, then, the other bidders would have been the firstones to have challenged the same. At any rate, this Court has to primarily consider whether thecommission of criminal offences, as alleged in the complaint, are made out or not and on the saidaspect, it has been found that no criminal offence is made out.65. Ground no.7: Complaint filed by respondent no.2 on the same set of the allegations before theLokayukta, Haryana, in which prayer has also been made for registration of FIR, the proceedingswhereof are pending.Complaint filed by respondent no.2 before the Lokayukta, Haryana (P-21) (Page 478) is stillpending.

The clause stated that the Bidder should have anannual turnover of at least INR100 Crores from the IT Business and operationsMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/80(System Integration Services, Software Development Services, Hardware supply,installation, commissioning, and facilities management services) during each of thelast three financial years (i.e. 2010- 2011, 2011-12, 2012-13), with positive net worthand profitability in last 2 years. Also, the participant/bidder was required to furnish'extracts from the audited Balance sheet and profit & loss; or certificate from theStatutory auditor' in evidence of the qualification.Whereas, UHGIS while submitting the bid, neither filed the extracts of the auditedbalance sheet and profit and loss as required nor it furnished a certificate from itsstatutory auditor certifying that the company had turnover of INR 100 crores fromthe services.Further, UHGIS ought to have had worked in all the above fields/services. It ispertinent to mention here 137 of 153 that UHGIS could not have worked in the saidfield which is clear from the perusal of their MOA and AOA. The MOA and AOA donot permit the company undertake such activities.The directors and other officials of UHGIS for procuring the said tender amended theMemorandum Of Association of UHGIS vide special resolution dated 29.04.2014 andincorporated clauses IB and 1C in the Objection Clause of the memorandum ofassociation of UHGIS thereby including the above activities /services(supra) in theobjectives of the company. It is relevant to mention here that the bids were submittedby UHGIS in the month of March 2014 whereas the amendment of memorandum ofassociation was carried out in the end month of April 2014 and the same wasapproved by the Registrar of Company on 3.6.2014. Copy of the AmendedMemorandum of Association is ANNEXURE-C-2.(7) That with regards to Sr. No. 8 of Chapter 4.3 Volume-II of RFP ,theparticipant/bidder should have experience of successfully completed / be in theprocess of executing large three Turnkey IT projects over multiple locations.

Also, the bidder was required to submitcopy of work order completion certificate(s).As per the information received under RTI, UHGIS in order to comply with theconditions/qualifications as mentioned at Sr.No.8 of 138 of 153 Para 4.3, submittedtwo experience certificates, one from M/s Optum Inc (USA) and another from M/sAdvance Care (Portugal).

In para 4 of the saidorder, there is a categorical finding that OPTUM is in fact holding company ofUHGIS. Copy of the order passed by Learned NCLT is annexed as ANNEXURE C-6.It is further learnt that Mr. John Santelli who has issued the experience certificate forOPTUM was in fact the reporting Manager of Mr. Partha Mishra at the relevant timewho at that time was heading UHGIS and was also leading the bid review committeeof UHGIS which was involved in the bid process.               xxx    xxx      xxx                      PRAYERIt is therefore. prayed that an inquiry be made against the public servant mentionedabove and FIR may be registered under all the enabling provisions of law, forcommitting the serious cognizable offences of corruption, criminal breach of trustetc. and causing wrongful and huge financial loss to the ex-chequer, in the interest ofjustice.It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court, if, may deem fit entrust the investigationof the present case to an independent investigation agency like Central Bureau ofInvestigation (hereinafter referred to as 'CBI') in view of the peculiar facts andcircumstances of the case.139 of 153 It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court may direct the public servantsinvolved to produce the entire record with regards to the issuance of tender andallotment of tender against the Request for Proposal dated 14.12.2013forimplementation of Hospital Information System (HIS) in the State of Haryana.SD/-Signature of the complainant (SHARAD KOTHARI)"A perusal of the above would show that the complaint filed before the Lokayukta, Haryana containssimilar allegations to the allegations as have been levelled in the present application under Section156(3) Cr.P.C. wherein, a prayer has also been made for registration of an FIR and the same wasfiled prior to the present application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and is currently pending beforethe Lokayukta Haryana. The complainant / respondent no.2 has been filing one complaint afteranother, in every forum available with an ulterior motive to wreak vengeance upon the petitioners.In spite of the inquiry pending in the above-stated matter, respondent no.2 has chosen to file thepresent application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., on the basis of which, the present FIR has beenregistered, so as to somehow extract money from the petitioners, regarding which, a legal notice hadbeen issued by him on 01.06.2016. The conduct of respondent no.2 as has been observedMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/82hereinabove, is an abuse of the process of the Court and thus, cannot be permitted.66. Ground no.8: Lack of locus standi of the complainant to file present application under Section156(3) Cr.P.C.Learned counsel for respondent no.2 had submitted that respondent no.2 had every locus toinstitute the complaint under Section 140 of 153 156(3) Cr.P.C. and for the said purpose, he hasreferred to provision of Section 39 Cr.P.C. Section 39 Cr.P.C. is reproduced hereinbelow:-"39. Public to give information of certain offences.(1) Every person, aware of the commission of, or of the intention of any other personto commit, any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the IndianPenal Code, (45 of 1860 ), namely:-(i) sections 121 to 126, both inclusive, and section 130 (that is to say, offences againstthe State specified in Chapter VI of the said Code);(ii) sections 143, 144, 145, 147 and 148 (that is to say, offences against the publictranquillity specified in Chapter VIII of the said Code);(iii) sections 161 to 165A, both inclusive (that is to say, offences relating to illegalgratification);(iv) sections 272 to 278, both inclusive (that is to say, offences relating to adulterationof food and drugs, etc.);(v) sections 302, 303 and 304 (that is to say, offences affecting life);(va) 1 section 364A (that is to say, offence relating to kidnapping for ransom, etc.);(vi) section 382 (that is to say, offence of theft after preparation made for causingdeath, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft);(vii) sections 392 to 399, both inclusive, and section 402 (that is to say, offences ofrobbery and dacoity);(viii) section 409 (that is to say, offence relating to criminal breach of trust by publicservant, etc.);(ix) sections 431 to 439, both inclusive (that is to say, offences of mischief againstproperty);141 of 153Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/83(x) sections 449 and 450 (that is to say, office of house- trespass);(xi) sections 456 to 460, both inclusive (that is to say, offences of lurking house-trespass); and(xii) sections 489A to 489E, both inclusive (that is to say, offences relating tocurrency notes and bank notes) shall, in the absence of any reasonable excuse, theburden of proving which excuse shall lie upon the person so aware, forthwith giveinformation to the nearest Magistrate or police officer of such commission orintention.(2) For the purposes of this section, the term" offence" includes any act committed atany place out of India which would constitute an offence if committed in India."It has been argued that every person who is aware of the commission of or of the intention of anyperson to commit any offence which have been detailed in Section 39, can institute a complaint.Sub-clause(viii) has been highlighted by respondent no.2 to state that for the offence committed under Section409 IPC, he has locus standi to file a complaint. The said argument has been considered by thisCourt and is found to be sans merit. A perusal of Section 39 Cr.P.C. would show that none of theother offences, i.e., Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC in the FIR find mention inSection 39 Cr.P.C.. Thus, as per the said provision respondent no.2 would not have locus standi toget an FIR registered as the third person, as per provision of Section 39 Cr.P.C., can only get FIRregistered under the sections mentioned in Section 39 Cr.P.C. With respect to Section 409, it wouldbe relevant to note that the said section is not even remotely attracted in the present case as hasbeen detailed hereinabove and as it has not even been alleged by respondent no.2 that any of thepetitioners were entrusted with property much less, by the respondent no.2 in their 142 of 153capacity as public servants or as banker, merchant, factor, broker or agent. Even the judgment of theHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Dr.Subramanian Swamy's case (supra) on which reliance hasbeen placed by respondent no.2, in order to make out a case for locus standi would show that in thesaid case the Hon'ble Supreme Court had observed that complaint can be filed for prosecuting apublic servant for offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The said proposition of law wouldnot apply to the facts of the present case inasmuch as, in the complaint under Section 156(3), nopublic servant has been made a party nor the provisions of Prevention of Corruption have beensought to be invoked in the application / complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.67. Conclusion:That on the basis of above-said factors, this Court is of the opinion that the impugned order as wellas the subsequent FIR arising therefrom, deserve to be quashed. Apart from the judgments whichhave been noticed hereinabove, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as various High Courtshave repeatedly held that where the grounds, as are there in the present case, are made out then, theHigh Court can exercise its powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the proceedings as well as toMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/84set aside the impugned order. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in State of Haryana and othersvs. Bhajan Lal and others (supra) has held as under:-"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of theCode under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in aseries of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article226 or the inherent powers under section 482of the Code which we have extractedand reproduced above, we give the following 143 of 153 categories of cases by way ofillustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of theprocess of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not bepossible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised andinflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kindsof cases wherein such power should be exercised.1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, evenif they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facieconstitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any,accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying aninvestigation by police officers under Section 156 (1) of the Code except under anorder of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and theevidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of anyoffence and make out a case against the accused.4. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not constitute a cognizable offence butconstitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a policeofficer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of theCode.5. Where the allegations made in the F.I.R. or complaint are so absurd and inherentlyimprobable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusionthat there 144 of 153 is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Codeor the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to theinstitution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specificprovision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for thegrievance of the aggrieved party.7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or wherethe proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreakingMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/85vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personalgrudge."In the above said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had enumerated categories of variouscases, by way of illustrations, wherein power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. could be exercised either toprevent abuse of the process of any Court or to otherwise secure the ends of justice. It is held thatthe present case would fall within the said parameters moreso, category 1, 2, 3 and 7.68. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in "T.T. Antony's case (supra) has observed as under: -"However, the sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizeneach time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident, givingrise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive FIRswhether before or after filing the final report under Section 173(2) CriminalProcedure Code, 1973 It would clearly be beyond the purview of sections 154 and 156Criminal 145 of 153  Procedure Code, 1973 nay, a case of abuse of the statutory powerof investigation in a given case. In our view a case of a fresh investigation based onthe second or successive FIRs, not being a counter case, filed in connection with thesame or connected cognizable offence alleged to have been committed in the courseof the same transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the first FIR eitherinvestigation is underway or final report under Section 173(2) has been forwarded tothe Magistrate, may be a fit case for exercise of power under Section 482 CriminalProcedure Code, 1973 or under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution.xxx xxx xxx The course adopted in this case, namely, the registration of theinformation as the second FIR in regard to the same incident and making a freshinvestigation is not permissible under the scheme of the provisions of the CriminalProcedure Code as pointed out above, therefore, the investigation undertaken and thereport thereof cannot but be invalid. We have, therefore, no option except to quashthe same leaving it open of the investigating agency to seek permission in Crime No.353/94 or 354/94 of the Magistrate to make further investigation, forward furtherreport or reports and thus proceed in accordance with law."A perusal of the above-reproduced judgment would show that it had been observed by the Hon'bleSupreme Court of India that in case, with respect to one incident an FIR already stands registered,then a second FIR with respect to the same incident cannot be registered and in case the same isregistered then, the High Court while exercising its powers under Section 482 Cr.P,C, would be wellwithin its rights to quash the second FIR. The same principle has been followed by the Hon'bleSupreme Court in the case of "Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah's case (supra). Thus, in a situationwhere 146 of 153 a second FIR is registered with respect to the same incident on which an FIR hasalready been registered as in the present case, the petition for quashing of the second FIR should notbe thrown out on the ground that the report under Section 173 CrPC has not been submitted.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/8669. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ajay Mitra vs. State of M.P. & Ors. reported as 2003(3) SCC 11has held as has observed as under: -"Leave granted.These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment and order datedJanuary 16, 2002 of High Court of Madhya Pradesh, by which three Petitions filed bythe appellants under Section 482Cr.P.C. were dismissed.xxx xxx xxx Thereafter, the appellants filed three Criminal Miscellaneous Petitionsunder Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court for quashing of the FIR and theproceedings of the case before the learned Magistrate. After hearing the parties, theHigh Court held that the investigation had not yet commenced in connection with theFIRs which had been registered at the Police Station and, therefore, the Petitionswere pre-mature and accordingly all the three Petitions were rejected.xxx xxx xxx The High Court has held that the Petitions filed by the appellants forquashing the complaint and the FIRs registered against them are pre-mature. Thequestion which arises is that where the complaint or the FIR does not disclosecommission of a cognizable offence, whether the same can be quashed at the initialstage? This question was examined by this Court in State of West Bengal &Ors. V.Swapan Kumar Guha &Ors., AIR 1982 Supreme Court 949 and it was held that theFirst Information Report which does not allege or disclose that the essentialrequirements of the penal provision are 147 of 153 prima facie satisfied, cannot formthe foundation or constitute the starting point of a lawful investigation. It is surelynot within the province of the police to investigate into a Report (FIR) which does notdisclose the commission of a cognizable offence and the code does not impose uponthem the duty of inquiry in such cases. It was further held that an investigation canbe quashed if no cognizable offence is disclosed by the FIR. The same question hasbeen considered in State of Haryana &Ors. V. Ch. Bhajan Lal &Ors. 1991(3) RCR(Criminal) 383 (SC) and after considering all the earlier decisions, the category ofcases, in which the Court can exercise its extra-ordinary power under Article 226 ofthe Constitution or the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. either to preventabuse of the process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice, were sumarised inpara 108 of the Report and sub- paras 1 to 3 thereof are being reproducedhereinbelow :"1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint,even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not primafacie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any,accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying aninvestigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under anMonishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/87order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and theevidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of anyoffence and make out a case against the accused."148 of 153 The said judgment by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Courthad affirmatively held that where an FIR does not disclose the essential requirementsof the penal provision or does not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence,the same can be quashed at the initial stage. Reference has also been made to thejudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case Bhajan Lal's case (supra), in which, itwas observed that the High Court can exercise its extra-ordinary power under Article226 of the Constitution or the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 1973 eitherto prevent abuse of the process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice.70. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in "R Kalyani vs. Janak C. Mehta" reported as 2009 (1) SCC516 has held as under:"Leave granted.2. Appellant lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the respondents on orabout 4.1.2003 under Sections 409, 420 and 468 read with Section 34 of the IndianPenal Code.3. First and second respondent approached the High Court for an order for quashingof the said FIR as also the investigation initiated pursuant thereto or in furtherancethereof. The High Court allowed the said proceedings by reason of the impugnedorder dated 29.4.2004.Mr. K.K. Mani, learned counsel appearing on behalf of theappellant, would, in support of the appeal, contend :(1) The High Court exercised its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Codeof Criminal Procedure wholly illegally and without jurisdiction insofar as it enteredinto the disputed questions of fact in regard to the involvement of the respondents asthe contents of the first information report disclose an offence of cheating, criminalbreach of trust and forgery.149 of 153 (2) While admittedly the investigation was not even complete, the HighCourt could not have relied upon the documents furnished by the defendants eitherfor the purpose of finding out absence of mens rea on the part of the applicants ortheir involvement in the case.(3) Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein being high ranking officers of M/s. Shares andSecurities Ltd., a company dealing in shares, were vicariously liable for commissionof the offence being in day to day charge of the affairs thereof.Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/88(4) An offence of forgery being a serious one and in view of the fact that therespondent No.2 forwarded a letter purporting to authorize the accused No.3 totransfer shares to the National Stock Exchange, he must be held to have the requisiteintention to commit the said offence along with the respondent No.3.(5) In any view of the matter, the respondent No. 3 being not an applicant before theHigh Court, the entire criminal prosecution could not have quashed by the HighCourt.xxx xxx xxx In Hamid v. Rashid alias Rasheed & Ors. [(2008) 1 SCC 474], this Courtopined :"6. We are in agreement with the contention advanced on behalf of the complainantappellant. Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code saves the inherent powers of theHigh Court and its language is quite explicit when it says that nothing in the Codeshall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make suchorders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to preventabuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Aprocedural Code, however exhaustive, cannot expressly provide for all time to comeagainst all the cases or points that may possibly 150 of 153 arise, and in order thatjustice may not suffer, it is necessary that every court must in proper cases exerciseits inherent power for the ends of justice or for the purpose of carrying out the otherprovisions of the Code. It is well established principle that every Court has inherentpower to act ex debito justitiae to do that real and substantial justice for theadministration of which alone it exists or to prevent abuse of the process of theCourt."xxx xxx xxx One of the paramount duties of the Superior Courts is to see that aperson who is apparently innocent is not subjected to persecution and humiliation onthe basis of a false and wholly untenable complaint.xxx xxx xxx A vicarious liability can be fastened only by reason of a provision of astatute and not otherwise. For the said purpose, a legal fiction has to be created. Evenunder a special statute when the vicarious criminal liability is fastened on a person onthe premise that he was in- charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it,all the Ingredients laid down under the statute must be fulfilled. A legal fiction mustbe confined to the object and purport for which it has been created. In Sham Sunder& Ors. V. State of Haryana [(1989) 4 SCC 630], this Court held :"9. But we are concerned with a criminal liability under penal provision and not acivil" liability. The penal provision must be strictly construed in the first place.Secondly, there is no vicarious liability in criminal law unless the statute takes thatalso within its fold. Section 10 does not provide for such liability. It does not make allthe partners liable for the offence whether they do business or not."Monishankar Hazra And Anr vs State Of Haryana And Another on 16 March, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5286035/89               xxx     xxx     xxx                          151 of 15327. If a person, thus, has to be proceeded with as being vicariously liable for the actsof the company, the company must be made an accused. In any event, it would be afair thing to do so, as legal fiction is raised both against the Company as well as theperson responsible for the acts of the Company.                   xxx     xxx     xxx                   30.     The     appeal   is   dismissed   with    the            aforementioned observations."A perusal of the said judgment would show that the High Court had, in a petitionunder section 482 Cr.P.C., quashed the FIR without the investigation having beencompleted and the said order was upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court qua the personswho had filed the petition under Section 482 of the Code.Relief:71. Keeping in view the eight grounds, as have been detailed in the preceding paragraphs and thefacts and circumstances of the present case and the ratio of law laid down in the plethora ofjudgments referred to hereinabove, both the petitions i.e., CRM-M-6692/2022 and CRM-M 6698/2022 are allowed and the impugned order dated 15.12.2021 is set aside and FIR no.508/2021 dated23.12.2021 registered under Sections 120B, 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471 of the IPC atPolice Station Sector 5, Panchkula and all the subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, arequashed.It is, however, clarified that the setting aside of the impugned order and quashing of the FIR and thesubsequent proceedings as well as the observations made in the present case would not affect theproceedings / complaint which is pending before the Lokayukta, Haryana and also the 152 of 153proceedings pending before the Rohini Courts in New Delhi arising out of the FIR no.419 dated18.08.2017 registered at Police Station Prashant Vihar, Delhi which had been registered inpursuance of the application dated 07.06.2017 filed under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. by Respondentno.2 in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini Courts, New Delhi.
