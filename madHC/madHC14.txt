Itruns two Hotels in the name and style of Le Royal Meridien, Chennai and Le Meridien, Coimbatore,classified as Five Star Deluxe Hotels by the Tourism Department of Government of India. There aremore than 600 persons are employed in these Hotels for 2 to 21 years. The 10th respondentCompany borrowed from certain financial institutions, raised Term Loans and Workinghttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Capital Loans from several Banks and financial institutions. Inthat process, the 10th respondent has availed loan from the first respondent to the tune of Rs.70.26Crores, apart from loan from other Consortium of Creditors. Even though the 10th respondent hasmortgaged the properties worth more than Rs.1,000 Crores including 25.64 Acres near ChennaiAirport, the Corporate Creditors initiated the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) foran outstanding or Rs.17.54 Crores as on 31.03.2020. The 9th respondent was appointed asCorporate Resolution Professional. He convened the meeting with the Committee of Creditors andresolved certain resolutions. If such resolutions are passed, it will lead to non-employment ofworkmen. The assets of others shall not be disposed as scrap leaving behind the Hotel businesswhich will only result in loss of value of assets fixing lesser value and if it is sold along with theimmovable properties to be run with the Hotels, it will fetch a higher value. However, withoutconsidering the loss of business, due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Corporate Resolution Professionaland Committee of Creditors planned to sell the immovable properties as scrap without anyguarantee or undertaking to protect the existing employment https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/condition to the present employees, which will bring more than 600 families to the street withoutany opportunity of getting alternative of employment.With these facts, the present Writ Petitions have been filed for the following relief:Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/3To forbear the respondents 1 to 9 from preparing an insolvency resolution planwithout incorporating necessary clauses in protecting the employment of theemployees / workmen employed in 10th respondent till the time normalcy is restoredand international flights are operated similar to period prior pandemic conditionCovid 19 and to consequently direct the 9th respondent to issue revisedadvertisements to that effect.4.The interim prayer of injunction restraining the 9th respondent / CorporateResolution Professional in any manner proceeding with the proposed resolution planapproval of Appu Hotels Limited, pending disposal of the Writ Petitions also sought.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/5.Para 32 of the affidavit filed in support of these Writ Petitions reads as under:I understand that 9th Respondent (RP) has convened to conduct a meeting ofCommittee of Creditors on 22.01.2021 to consider and approve the ResolutionApplications. If they approve any of the expression of interest / resolution proposal tonon-hotelier like hospital or real estate owner then life and livelihood of more than600 persons and their families would be adversely affected. In the abovecircumstances, it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grantan order of ad interim injunction restraining 9th Respondents (ResolutionProfessional) in any manner proceeding with the proposed resolution plan approvalof Appu Hotels Limited pending disposal of the above Writ Petitions and thus renderjustice.6.Mr.N.G.R. Prasad, learned counsel appearing for Mr.K.M.Ramesh, wouldvehemently contend that there is no scope for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/employees to interfere with the winding up application and therefore, they are not ina position to approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in the aboveInsolvency Resolution Process. In so far as life and liberty of the employees isinvolved, it fall under the purview of public law remedy and therefore, only the HighCourt under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can interfere with the illegalaction of the 9th and 10th respondents. Further, the action of the 9th respondent iscontrary to Sections 30 and 31 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Theduties of Corporate Resolution Professional is to see that the Industry is revived andto protect the assets of the Corporate Debtor. On the other hand, beyond the powersconferred on him, he proceeds to sell the property as a scrap in detrimental not onlyto the Corporate Debtor but also to the 600 families depending on the Hotels ownedby the 10th respondent.7.The learned counsel would also contend that the bar of jurisdiction specified in Section 231 of IBCand Section 430 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, will apply only to the Civil Courts. It bars thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ jurisdiction of Civil Courts alone and the High Court exercisingFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/4the Constitutional powers is not bound by the above provisions. Therefore, he would seek this Courtto entertain the above Writ Petitions.8.I have considered the submissions.9.At the outset, the prayer in these Writ Petitions reads as under:To forbear the respondents 1 to 9 from preparing an insolvency resolution plan withoutincorporating necessary clauses in protecting the employment of the employees / workmenemployed in 10th respondent till the time normalcy is restored and international flights are operatedsimilar to period prior pandemic condition Covid 19 and to consequently direct the 9th respondentto issue revised advertisements to that effect.10.A reading of the prayer clearly shows that an injunction restraining the respondents 1 to 9 frompreparing an Insolvency Resolution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Plan without incorporatingthe necessary clauses purely falls within the purview of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) andthe matter seized off by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). When the insolvencyproceedings have already been initiated and a Corporate Resolution Professional has beenappointed, the matter falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of NCLT. When there is a specific statutegovern the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, it shall be done within the four corners of thatstatute. Only when the Tribunal exercise the jurisdiction which is not vested in it or available to it orwhen failed to exercise the available jurisdiction, the High Court can interfere under Article 226 ofthe Constitution of India. On the one hand, a judicial forum making a wrong decision within itsjurisdiction where it has right to consider. On the other hand, a judicial forum has no jurisdiction orright to consider a particular aspect and also no power to grant the relief prayed for. In the firstinstance, where there is a wrong decision taken within its jurisdiction, it is amenable to appeal asprovided in the statute. Only when judicial forum lacks jurisdiction or failed to exercise thejurisdiction or exercise the jurisdiction without any power to grant the relief,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ the judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of Indiawill come into play.11.In the instant case, the relief sought for is to forbear the respondents from preparing theInsolvency Resolution Plan, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NCLT. When a poweris exercised within its jurisdiction as provided under the Statute, this Court cannot entertain theWrit Petition inferring the same. Apart from this, the interim prayer sought for proceeds on thebasis of apprehension that if the Committee of Creditors approve the resolution application, 600persons and their families will be adversely affected. But this is purely based on apprehension andnot based on any concluded action by the respondents. Therefore, merely on apprehension also, theWrit Petitions are not maintainable.12.The learned counsel for the petitioner also would rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble SupremeCourt in NATIONAL TEXTILE WORKERS' UNION AND OTHERS VS. P.R.RAMAKRISHNAN ANDhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ OTHERS [1983 (1) SCC 228] and relying on the wordings ofJustice P.N.Bhagwati, O.Chinnappa Reddy and Baharul Islam, would contend that the employeesFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/5grievances shall be redressed. The learned Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the abovejudgment, observed that the recognised principle of fair judicial procedure requires the rule of audialteram partem which constitutes one of the basic principles of natural justice and denial of thesame would amount to denial of the right of the workmen to be heard prejudically affecting theirinterest. Therefore, before the initiation of winding up of petition, or before appointment ofprovisional Liquidator, the workers would have a right to be heard if they apply for being heard. Thesocial-economic objectives, set out in the Preamble, Articles 23, 24 and Part IV and especially Article43-A of the Constitution of India clearly mandate that the management of the enterprise should notbe left entirely in the hands of the suppliers of capital, but the workers, who supply labour, beingequally, if nor more, interested in the enterprise, should also be entitled to participate in it.Therefore, the workers must have voice or a right to be heard. However, the appeals were dismissed,on the ground that the Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ cannot make any order or anyconflict of the existing law. The observations made are as under:3.We may now proceed to consider the question that arises for determination beforeus. The question, briefly stated, is: when a petition for winding up a company is filedin court, are the workmen of the company entitled to ask the court to implead themas parties in the winding up petition or to allow them to appear and contest thewinding up petition or they have no locus standi at all so far as winding up petition isconcerned and they must helplessly watch the proceedings as outsiders though theresult of the winding up petition may be to bring about termination of their servicesand thus affect them vitally by depriving them of their means of livelihood ? It is awell established principle of administrative law that no order entailing adverse civilconsequences can be made by the State or a public authority unless the personaffected is afforded an opportunity to show cause against the making of such order bycontroverting the allegations made against him andhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ presenting his own positive case, but in case of awinding up petition, it was contended on behalf of respondents Nos. 2 to 5, thatthough the result of successful termination of a winding up petition may, and in mostcases, would be to put an end to the services of the workmen and throw them on thestreets, they are not entitled to an opportunity to be heard against the making of thewinding up order, because under the Companies Act 1956, it is only the creditors andcontributories and in certain specified contingencies, the Registrar and the CentralGovernment who can present a petition for winding up a company and the workmenhave no locus at all in a winding up petition except where their dues have remainedunpaid in which case they would be entitled to be heard in a winding up petition, butthat would be in their capacity as creditors and not as workmen.It was also urged on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 to 5 that in any event, even if workmen have a rightto intervene in a winding up petition in the present case, it was not the workmen who had appliedfor being heard in the winding up petition but the applications were made by the threehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ unions and since a Union of workmen has no right to be heard,the applications of the three unions were rightly rejected. This last contention of respondent Nos. 1to 5 is obviously untenable and it need not detain us. It is incontrovertible- and this indeed could notFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/6be disputed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 to 5-that the applications were made by the Unions onbehalf of the workmen represented by them and though made in the name of the unions, theapplications were in reality and substance applications of the workmen who were members of eachrespective union. The controversy therefore really is not whether the unions of workmen are entitledto be heard in a winding up petition but whether the workmen have such right when a winding uppetition is filed against a company. We may straight away point out that though the applicationsmade by the Coimbatore District National Textile Employees and Coimbatore District EngineeringWorkers Union were for impleading them as parties in the winding up petition, it was conceded onbehalf of these two unions that they were not pressing their applications for being added as parties,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ because there was no procedure known to Companies Act 1956for any one to be impleaded as a party in a winding up petition and even the creditors andcontributories were not entitled to be added as parties and they were claiming only the right toappear and be heard in support or opposition to the winding up petition. The contention of thesetwo unions was therefore a limited one and that was also the narrow contention advanced on behalfof National Textile Workers' Union, namely, that the workmen represented by them were entitled tointervene in the winding up petition and to be heard before any order was made by the CompanyJudge in the winding up petition, because any such order might affect the interest of the workmen.It was pointed out on behalf of the three unions that even if an interim order were to be made by theCompany Judge which might prejudicially affect the workmen by freezing the resources of thecompany so as to make it difficult for the company to pay the wages of the workmen or bringingabout stoppage of the business of the company resulting in non-payment or diminution of theirhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ wages or termination of their services, the workmen must surelybe afforded an opportunity to be heard before any such interim order is made. It would be contraryto every recognised principle of fair judicial procedure and violative of the rule of audi alterampartem which constitutes one of the basic principles of natural justice to deny to the workmen theright to be heard before an order is made by the Company Judge prejudicially affecting theirinterest. Additionally, reliance was also placed on behalf of the three unions on Rule 34 of theCompanies (Court) Rules 1959 which provides as follows:"Rule 34. Notice to be given by persons intending to appear at the hearing of petition-Every person,who intends to appear at the hearing of a petition, whether to support or oppose the petition, shallserve on the petitioner or his advocate, notice of his intention at the address given in theadvertisement. The notice shall contain the address of such person, and be signed by him or hisadvocate, and save as otherwise provided by these rules shall be served (or if sent by post, shall beposted in such time as to reach the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ addressee) not later than twodays previous to the day of hearing, and in the case of a petition for winding up not later than fivedays previous to the day of hearing. Such notice shall be in Form No. 9, with such variations as thecircumstances may require, and where such person intends to oppose the petition, the grounds ofhis opposition, or a copy of his affidavit if any, shall be furnished along with the notice. Any personwho has failed to comply with this rule shall not except with the leave of the Judge, be allowed toappear at the hearing of the petition."The argument urged on behalf of the three unions was that this rule confers a right on the workmento appear at the hearing of the winding up petition either to support it or to oppose it and clearlyFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/7recognises that they are entitled to intervene and be heard in the winding up petition. RespondentNos. 1 to 5 however seriously challenged the locus of the workmen to appear and be heard in thewinding up petition and contended that so far as the winding up petition is concerned, it is only thecreditors and contributories and in certain specified contingencies thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Registrar and the Central Government who are entitled to appearat the hearing of the winding up petition whether to support or to oppose it. The right to be heard inthe winding up petition, contended respondent Nos. 1 to 5 is governed solely by the provisions of theCompanies Act 1956 and since no such right is conferred on the workmen by any provision of theCompanies Act 1956, the workmen are not entitled to intervene in the winding up petition, eventhough the making of a winding up order may result in termination of their services. The workmen,according to respondent Nos. 1 to 5, could appear at the hearing of the winding up petition andmake their submissions only in their capacity as creditors if any part of their wages remained unpaidby the company but they had no locus to appear in their capacity as workers. These rival contentionsurged on behalf of the parties raised an interesting question of law which we shall now proceed toconsider.4.There is one very important consideration which we must bear in mind while dealing with thisquestion and it is necessary to advert to it at the present stage. The concept ofhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ a company has undergone radical transformation in the last fewdecades. The traditional view of a company was that it was a convenient mechanical device forcarrying on trade and industry, a mere legal frame work providing a convenient institutionalcontainer for holding and using the powers of company management. The company law was at thattime conceived merely as a statute intended to regulate the structure and mode of operation of aspecial type of economic institution called company. This was the view which prevailed for a longtime in juristic circles all over the democratic world including United States of America, UnitedKingdom and India. That was the time when the doctrine of laissez faire held sway and it dominatedthe political and economic scene. This doctrine glorified the concept of a free economic society inwhich State intervention in social and economic matters was kept at the lowest possible level. Butgradually this doctrine was eroded by the emergence of new social values which recognised the roleof the State as an active participant in the social and economic life of the citizen in order to beingabout general https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ welfare and common good of the community. Withthis change in socio-economic thinking, the developing role of companies in modern economy andtheir increasing impact on individuals and groups, through the ramifications of their activities,began to be increasingly recognised. It began to be realised that the company is a species of socialorganisation, with a life and dynamics of its own and exercising a significant power in contemporarysociety. The new concept of corporate responsibility transcending the limited traditional views aboutthe relationship between management and shareholders and embracing within its scope much widergroups affected by the trading activities and other connected operations of companies, emerged asan important feature of contemporary thought on the role of the corporation in modern society. Theadoption of the socialistic pattern of society as the ultimate goal of the country's economic and socialpolicies hastened the emergence of this new concept of the corporation. The socio- economicobjectives set out in Part IV of the Constitution have since guided and shaped this new corporatephilosophy.Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/8https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ We shall presently refer to some of the Directive Principles ofState Policy set out in Part IV which clearly show the direction in which the corporate sector isintended to move and the role which it is intended to play in the social and economic life of thenation. But, one thing is certain that the old nineteenth century view which regarded a companymerely as a legal device adopted by shareholders for carrying on trade or business as proprietors hasbeen discarded and a company is now looked upon as a socio- economic institution wieldingeconomic power and influencing the life of the people.5.It is now accepted on all hands, even in predominantly capitalist countries, that a company is notproperty. The traditional view that the company is the property of the shareholders is now anexploded myth. There was a time when a group controlling the majority of shares in a company usedto say: "This is our concern. We can do what we like with it." The ownership of the concern wasidentified with those who brought in capital. That was the outcome of the property-mindedcapitalistic society in which https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ the concept of company originated.But this view can no longer be regarded as valid in the light of the changing socio- economicconcepts and values. Today social scientists and thinkers regard a company as a living, vital anddynamic, social organism with firm and deep rooted affiliations with the rest of the community inwhich it functions. It would be wrong to look upon it as something belonging to the shareholders. Itis true that the shareholders bring capital, but capital is not enough. It is only one of the factorswhich contributes to the production of national wealth. There is another equally, if not more,important factor of production and that is labour. Then there are the financial institutions anddepositors, who provide the additional finance required for production and lastly, there are theconsumers and the rest of the members of the community who are vitally interested in the productmanufactured in the concern. Then how can it be said that capital, which is only one of the factors ofproduction, should be regarded as owner having an exclusive dominion over the concern, as if theconcern belongs to it? A company, according to the new socio-https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ enconomic thinking, is a social institution having duties andresponsibilities towards the community in which it functions. The Supreme Court pointed out as farback as 1950 in Chiranjeetlal v. Union of India:"We should bear in mind that a corporation, which is engaged in production of commodities vitallyessential to the community, has a social character of its own and it must not be regarded as theconcern primarily or only of those who invest their money in it."Pt. Govind Ballabh Pant also pointed out in one of his speeches:"...industry is not an isolated concern of the shareholders or the managing agents alone. It reacts onthe entire people in the country, on their economic conditions, on employment or standard of living,on everything that conduces to the material well being."The same view was also expressed at the International Seminar on Current Problems of CorporateLaw, Management and Practice held in New Delhi where it was observed that "an enterprise is acitizen. Like a citizen https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ it is esteemed and judged by its actions inFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/9relation to the community of which it is a member as well as by its economic performance." That iswhy it is regarded as one of the paramount objectives of a company to bring about maximisation ofsocial welfare and common good. This necessarily involves reorientation of thinking in regard to theduties and obligations of a company not only vis-a-vis the shareholders but also vis-a- vis the rest ofthe community affected by its operations such as workers, consumers and the Governmentrepresenting the society. There was at one time a serious controversy between two schools ofthought, one represented by Adolf Berle and the other by Professor Dodd, as regards the nature ofduties and obligations owed by directors representing management of a company. Adolf Berle tookthe view that directors are trustees only for shareholders-that is the traditional view which directlyflows from a purely capitalistic approach which identifies ownership and dominion withcapital-while Prof. Dodd believed that directors are trustees not only for shareholders but also forthe entire community. Ultimately, however, in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ his subsequentbook, "Twentieth Century Capitalist Revolution", Adolf Berle conceded that Prof. Dodd was rightand that modern directors are not limited to running business enterprise for maximum profitmotive alone, but are in fact administrators of community system or of a social institution. That iswhy we find that in recent times there is considerable thinking on the subject of socialresponsibilities of corporate management and it is now acknowledged even in highly developedcountries like the United States and England that maximisation of social welfare should be thelegitimate goal of a company and shareholders should be regarded not as proprietors of thecompany, but merely as suppliers of capital entitled to no more than reasonable return and thecompany should be responsible not only to shareholders but also to workers, consumers and theother members of the Community and should be guided by considerations of national economy andprogress. This new concept of a Company was felicitously expressed by Desai, J sitting as a Judge ofthe Gujarat High Court in Panchmahal https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Steel Ltd. v. UniversalSteel Traders(1) in the following words:"Time-honoured approach that the company law must safeguard the interest of investors andshareholders of the company would be too rigid a framework in which it can now operate. Newproblems call for a fresh approach. And in ascertaining and devising this fresh approach, theobjective for which the company is formed may provide a guide line for the direction to be taken. AsProf. De Wool of Belgium puts it, the company has a three-fold reality economic, human andpublic-each with its own internal logic. The reality of the company is much broader than that of anassociation of capital; it is a human working community that performs a collective action for thecommon good. In recent years a debate is going on in the world at large on the functions andfoundations of corporate enterprise. The "preservationists" and the "reformers" are vigorouslypropounding their views on the possible reform of company, the modern trend emphasising thepublic interest in corporate enterprise."https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ The learned judge elaborated this "modern trend" by quotingfrom Prof. Gower's book on "The Principles of Modern Company Law":"One section of the community whose interests as such are not afforded any protection, either underthis head or by virtue of the provisions for investor or creditor protection, are the workers andemployees of the taken-over company. This is a particularly unfortunate facet of the principle thatFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/10the interest of the company means only the interest of the members and not of those whoselivelihood is in practice much more closely involved."6.We are concerned in these appeals only with the relationship of the workers vis-a-vis thecompany. It is clear from what we have stated above that it is not only the shareholders who havesupplied capital who are interested in the enterprise which is being run by a company but theworkers who supply labour are also equally interested because what is produced by the enterprise isthe result of labour as well as capital. In fact, the owners of capital bear only limited financial riskand otherwise contribute nothing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ to production while labourcontributes a major share of the product While the former invest only a part of their moneys, thelatter invest their sweat and toil, in fact their life itself. The workers therefore have a special place ina socialist pattern of society. They are no more vendors of toil, they are not a marketable commodityto be purchased by the owners of capital. They are producers of wealth as much as capital. Theysupply labour without which capital would be impotent and they are, at the least, equal partnerswith capital in the enterprise. Our constitution has shown profound concern for the workers andgiven them a pride of place in the new socio-economic order envisaged in the Preamble and theDirective Principles of State Policy. The Preamble contains the profound declaration pregnant withmeaning and hope for millions of peasants and workers that India shall be a socialist democraticrepublic where social and economic justice will inform all institutions of national life and there willbe equality of status and opportunity for all and every endeavour shall be made to promotefraternity ensuring the dignity of the individual. Every one is assuredhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ under Article 14 equality before the law and equal protection ofthe laws and implicit in this provision is the guarantee of equal remuneration for men and womenfor some work or work of a similar nature. Traffic in human beings and begar and other similarforms of forced labour are prohibited under Article 23 and Article 24 mandates that no child belowthe age of 14 may be employed in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardousemployment. These two Articles recently came up for construction before this Court in People'sUnion for Democratic Rights & Ors.v. Union of India & Ors.(1) Article 38 imposes obligation on theState, albeit unenforceable in a court of law, to "strive to promote the welfare of the people bysecuring and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which social justice shall inform allthe institutions of the national life". This is followed by Article 39 which inter alia obliges the Stateto direct its policy towards securing that the citizens, men and women equally have the right to anadequate means of livelihood, the ownership and control of the material resources of the communityare so distributed as best to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ subserve the common good, theoperation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means ofproduction to the common detriment, there is equal pay for equal work for both men and womenand the health and strength of workers, men and women and the tender age of children are notabused and citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age orstrength. The State is directed by Article 41 to make effective provision, within the limits of itseconomic capacity and development, for securing the right to work and Article 42 requires the Stateto make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. Article43 provides that the State shall endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation or economicorganisation or in any other way, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring decent standard of lifeand full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities. Then follows Article 43A whichFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/11is intended to herald industrial democracy and in the words of Krishna Iyer, J. mark "the end ofindustrial bonded labour". That Article says that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ State shalltake steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of workers in themanagement of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. Theconstitutional mandate is therefore clear and undoubted that the management of the enterpriseshould not be left entirely in the hands of the suppliers of capital but the workers should also beentitled to participate in it, because in a socialist pattern of society, the enterprise which is a centreof economic power should be controlled not only by capital but also by labour. It is therefore idle tocontend thirty two years after coming into force of the Constitution and particularly after theintroduction of Article 43A in the Constitution that the workers should have no voice in thedetermination of the question whether the enterprise should continue to run or be shut down underan order of the court. It would indeed be strange that the workers who have contributed to thebuilding of the enterprise as a centre of economic power should have no right to be heard when it issought to demolish that centre of economic power.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/7.The principal argument urged against the right of the workers to be heard in the winding uppetition was that under the scheme of the Companies Act 1956, it is only the creditors andcontributories who are entitled to appear and be heard in a winding up petition. The Companies Act1956 is a self-contained code exhaustive in regard to all matters relating to companies and sincethere is no provision in that Act conferring on the workers a right to intervene in a winding uppetition, no such right can be spelt out in their favour outside the provisions of that Act RespondentNos. 6 to 9 relied upon various provisions of the Companies Act 1956 in support of their contentionthat the workers have no locus in a winding up petition but we do not think these provisions lendany support to that contention. The first provision relied upon by Respondent Nos. 6 to 9 wassection 439 which inter alia provides as to who shall be entitled to make an application for windingup of a company. It is no doubt true that this section confers the right to present a winding uppetition only on certain specifically enumerated persons and the workers are nothttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ included in that enumeration and therefore obviously, theworkers have no right to prefer a petition for winding up of a company. The right to apply forwinding up of a company being a creature of statute, none other than those on whom the right topresent a winding up petition is conferred by the statute can make an application for winding up acompany and no such right having been conferred on the workers, they cannot prefer a winding uppetition against a company. But from this exclusion of the workers from the right to present awinding up petition, it does not follow as a necessary consequence that the workers have no right toappear and be heard in a winding up petition filed by one or more of the persons specified in section439. It may be that the workers have no right to present a winding up petition against the company,but if a winding up petition is properly filed by any of the persons entitled to do so under section439, they may still be entitled to appear and be heard in support or opposition to the winding uppetition. That would depend upon whether their interest is likely to be affected by any order whichmay be made on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ winding up petition. The next section reliedupon by respondent Nos. 6 to 9 was section 440 which says that where a company is being woundup voluntarily or subject to the supervision of the court, a petition for its winding up by court may beFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/12presented by any person authorised to do so under section 439 or the official Liquidator, but thecourt shall not make a winding up order unless it is satisfied that the voluntary winding up orwinding up subject to the supervision of the court cannot be continued with due regard to theinterests of the creditors or contributories or both. It was urged on behalf of respondent Nos. 6 to 9that this section shows that the winding up of a company is intended to be for the benefit of thecreditors and the contributories and the interest of the workers has no place at all in the winding upand is not required to be taken into account in winding up the company. This argument is also inour opinion futile because what this section deals with is the stage after the winding up hascommenced, whether voluntary or subject to the supervision of the court, while we are concernedwith a stage anterior to the making of a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ winding up order. Therecan be little doubt that the object of winding up being to realise the assets of the company, pay thepreferential claims and expenses of liquidation and then discharge the debts of the creditors in fullor pari passu and if after paying to the creditors, there is any surplus, distribute the same among theshareholders by way of dividend and ultimately dissolve the company, it is only the creditors and thecontributories who would be affected by any action taken in the course of winding up of thecompany and that is why we find several provisions in the Companies Act 1956 which speak ofwinding up being carried on with due regard to the interest of the creditors and the contributories orafter consultation with them or confer rights on the creditors and the contributories to makeapplications for diverse purposes with a view to effective winding up of the company. Suchprovisions are for instance to be found in section 464, 466, 478, 517, 542, 543, 549, 556, 557 and560. These provisions apply at a stage after a winding up order is made by the court or the voluntarywinding up has commenced or an order is made for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ continuanceof winding up subject to the supervision of the court, when winding up having been ordered orresolved, what remains to be done is only to wind up the company, pay the creditors and if there isany surplus, distribute the same among the shareholders. These provisions do not deal with asituation prior to the making of the winding up order when the question is whether the companyshould be ordered to be wound up or not. While the company is continuing to subsist, the workerswould be employed in the enterprise which is being run by the company and they would be earningtheir livelihood from such employment, but if an order for winding up is made, their services would,except in cases where the business of the company is continued, stand terminated by reason of sub-section (3) of section 445 which provides that a winding up order "shall be deemed to be notice ofdischarge to the officers and employees of the company, except when the business of the company iscontinued." Ordinarily when a winding up order is made, the business of the company would ceaseto continue and even if the Liquidator is authorised to carry on the business, suchhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ continuance would be only for the beneficial winding up of thecompany and the logical and inevitable end would be the ultimate discontinuance of the business.The making of a winding up order on a petition for winding up would therefore almost certainlyhave an adverse consequence on the workers in as much as the continuance of their service would beseriously jeopardised and their right to work and earn their livelihood would be disastrouslyimperilled. Now it is an elementary principle of law, well settled as a result of several decisions ofthis Court and particularly the decisions in State of Orissa v. Dr. Bini Pani,(1) A.K. Kraipa v. Unionof India,(2) and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India(3) that no order involving adverse civilconsequences can be passed against any person without giving him an opportunity to be heardagainst the passing of such order and this rule applies irrespective of whether the proceeding inFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/13which it is passed is a quasi judicial or an administrative proceeding. The audi alterum partem rulewhich mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard is one of the basic principles of naturaljustice and if this rule https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ has been held to be applicable in aquasi-judicial or even in an administrative proceeding involving adverse civil consequences, it woulda fortiori apply in a judicial proceeding such as a petition for winding up of a company. It is difficultto imagine how any system of law which is designed to promote justice through fairplay in actioncan permit the court to make a winding up order which has the effect of bringing about terminationof the services of the workers without giving them an opportunity of being heard against the makingof such order. It would be violative of the basic principle of fair procedure and unless there isexpress provision in the Companies Act 1956 which forbids the workers from appearing at thehearing of the winding up petition and participating in it, the workers must be held entitled toappear and be heard in the winding up petition. That is the minimum requirement of the principleof audi alterum partem which cannot be ignored save on pain of invalidation of the order of windingup. Here we do not find any provision in the Companies Act 1956 which in so many terms excludesthe workers from appearing at the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ hearing of the winding uppetition with a view to supporting or opposing it and the only ground on which the right of theworkers to appear and be heard in the winding up petition is disputed is that there is no specificprovision in the Act entitling them to do so and the right to apply for winding up as also toparticipate in the proceedings in the course of winding up is conferred only on the creditors and thecontributories. But, we have pointed out above that merely because the right to apply for winding upa company is not given to the workers it does not mean that they cannot appear to support oroppose a winding up petition which is properly filed by one or the other persons specified in section439. There would, in fact, be no point in conferring the right to apply for winding up of a companyon the workers since they cannot have any interest in demolishing the enterprise which is the sourceof their livelihood and particularly when the only effect of the winding up order would be to renderthem unemployed and to bring about winding up of the company for the benefit of the creditors andthe contributories. So also the circumstance https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ that the right to beconsulted or to make applications in the course of the winding up of a company is conferred only onthe creditors and the contributories does not in any way militate against the right of the workers toappear and be heard in the winding up petition because once the winding up order is made, theassets of the company have to be realised, the creditors have to be paid and if there is any surplus ithas to be distributed among the contributories and therefore at that stage it is only the creditors andthe contributories who have an interest and that is why in the course of the winding up it is thecreditors and the contributories who have been given a voice. That has nothing to do with thequestion whether the company should be wound up or not which is a question in which the workersare vitally concerned and on which they must obviously be heard before any decision is taken by thecourt.8......10.We may also mention that on behalf of the appellants some reliance was placed on Rule 34 of theCompanies (Court) Rules 1959 in support of their contention https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ thatnot only the creditors and the contributories but also other persons are entitled to appear at thehearing of a winding up petition and the workers cannot therefore be excluded. This Rule providesFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/14that every person who intends to appear at the hearing of a winding up petition, whether to supportor to oppose it, shall serve on the petitioner or his advocate notice of his intention at the addressgiven in the advertisement and such notice shall be in form No. 9 and where such person intends tooppose the winding up petition, the grounds of his opposition or a copy of his affidavit if any shall befurnished along with the notice. The appellants contended that under this Rule any one who wantsto appear in a winding up petition can do so, provided he serves on the petitioner or his advocate,notice of his intention at the address given in the advertisement and complies with the otherrequirements of this Rule and therefore if the workers desire to appear at the hearing of the windingup petition, they are entitled to do so. The answer given on behalf of respondent Nos. 6 to 9 to thiscontention was that Rule 34 is applicable only after a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ winding uppetition is admitted and an order is made for advertisement of the winding up petition and it has noapplication at the stage when the winding up petition is before the court only for the purpose ofdeciding whether or not it should be admitted and advertised. It was also urged on behalf ofrespondent Nos. 6 to 9 that in any event Rule 34 does not confer a right on any and every person toappear at the hearing of the winding up petition, intends so to appear he must take various steps setout in that Rule beginning with service of notice on the petitioner or his advocate before he can beheard on the winding up petition. We are inclined to agree with this contention of respondent Nos. 6to 9. It is obvious that the object and purpose of Rule 34 is not to confer a right on any one to appearat the hearing of the winding up petition but merely to provide the procedure to be followed before aperson who is otherwise entitled to appear in a winding up petition can be heard in support oropposition of the winding up petition. This rule cannot therefore be relied upon by the appellants asconferring a right on the workers to appear at the hearing of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ awinding up petition. But, one thing is clear that this Rule does postulate that apart from thecreditors and contributories there may be other persons who are entitled to appear at the hearing ofthe winding up petition because it is not confined in its application to the creditors andcontributories but uses the generic impression "every person" and to this limited extent it doesundoubtedly lend some support to the contention of the appellants.11.We are therefore of the view that the workers are entitled to appear at the hearing of the windingup petition whether to support or to oppose it so long as no winding up order is made by the court.The workers have a locus to appear and be heard in the winding up petition both before the windingup petition is admitted and an order for advertisement is made as also after the admission andadvertisement of the winding up petition until an order is made for winding up the company. If awinding up order is made and the workers are aggrieved by it, they would also be entitled to preferan appeal and contend in the appeal that no winding up order should have been made by thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Company Judge. But when a winding up order is made and it hasbecome final, the workers ordinarily would not have any right to participate in any proceeding in thecourse of winding up the company though there may be rare cases where in a proceeding in thecourse of winding up, the interest of the workers may be involved and in such a case it may bepossible to contend that the workers must be heard before an order is made by the court. We thinkthat even when an application for appointment of a provisional liquidator is made by the petitionerin a winding up petition, the workers would have a right to be heard if they so wish because theappointment of a provisional liquidator may adversely affect the interest of the workers. But we maymake it clear that neither the petitioner nor the court would be under any obligation to give notice ofFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/15such application to the workers. It would be for the workers to apply for being heard and if they doso, they would be entitled to appear and be heard on the application for appointment of provisionalliquidator. The workers therefore in the present case had a right to be heard beforehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ the provisional liquidator was appointed by the Company Judgebut the circumstance that the workers were not so heard would not have the effect of vitiating theorder appointing provisional liquidator, because on the view taken by us, it would be open to theworkers to apply to the court for vacating that order and it would be for the court after consideringthe material produced before it and hearing the parties to decide whether that order should bevacated or not.15.No doubt, it was the creative genius of the bourgeoisie that invented the corporations and thecompanies, invested them with a corporate soul and a juristic personality and called them legalentities in order to meet the growing and complex demands of modern industry and management,to conduct business and commercial activities more conveniently and efficiently, and essentially tofoster, consolidate and stabilise the capitalist system of society under whose aegis alone theexploiting class could thrive and continue to exploit the working class. Corporations became thesymbol of competitive capitalism.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ But the historical processes continue at work. The movement isnow towards socialism. The working classes, all the world over, are demanding 'workers' control'and 'Industrial Democracy'. They want security and the right to work to be secured. They want thecontrol and direction of their lives in their own hands and not in the hands of the industrialists,bankers and brokers. Our constitution has accepted the workers' entitlement to control and it is oneof the Directive Principles of State Policy that the State shall take steps, by suitable legislation or inany other way, to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings,establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. It is in this context of changingnorms and waxing values that one has to judge the workers' demand to be heard.16...18.Re Bradford Navigation Company and passages from textbooks for which the case is the source ofauthority were relied upon, to urge that none but contributories and creditors may be heard inwinding-up petition. Re Bradford https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Navigation Company is a relicof an alien past. Fortunately it is not a binding precedent. While we have learnt and borrowed agreat deal from British Jurisprudence, we have been drawing the line now and then, here and there,because their law, their jurisprudence suits their genius and ours must develop according to ourgenius. Our needs are different; our social, political and economic bases are different; ouraspirations are different; our systems are different; the stages of our development are different. Wehave a written constitution which is omnipresent when our laws are made, tested, interpreted orexecuted. We look to the constitution for guidance and inspiration when we interpret the laws. The42nd Amendment of the Constitution has introduced new lights into the Constitution. TheConstitution is now openly socialist. The Directive Principles of State Policy repeatedly emphasisethe role and interest of the workers. Article 43-A, also introduced by the 42nd Amendmentcontemplates workers' participation in the management of industry. Other Directive PrinciplesFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/16require the State to make provision for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ securing the right towork, for securing just and humane conditions of work and for securing the right to an adequatemeans of livelihood. The State is enjoined to direct its policy towards securing that the ownershipand control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve thecommon good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration ofwealth and means of production to the common detriment. Obviously, it is nationalisation that is inview and nationalisation must mean the setting up of public corporations and the transformation ofprivate corporations into public corporations. Truly the Constitution envisages workers' control andnationalisation as two of the roads to socialism. Private corporations hitherto regarded as bastionsof private property and leaders of capitalist economy are undergoing transformation and, are surelyacquiring the character of public institutions. The public interest element is now quite apredominant factor in the Companies Act itself. There are several provisions in the Companies Actwhich take notice of the element of public interest.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ There are other enactments like the Monopolies and RestrictiveTrade Practices Act, the Industries Regulation and Development Act, under whose provisions, theactivities of a company may be scrutinised in the public interest. There are a host of otherlegislations involving employment and welfare of labour, to which the managements of companiesare subject. The transformation of a company's character from private to public is going on rightbefore our eyes even as the institution of private property is also losing its diathesis. It is in thiscontext of ferment and development that we must consider the problem before us. There is nosanctity attached to the age of a judgment or to the circumstance that the decision is that of anEnglish Court from where we have borrowed most of our company law. Re Bradford NavigationCompany was decided in the heydays of laissez faire at a time when individualism dominated everyfield and the public interest was but a slow runner. Now the position is reversed. Laissez faire haslong been dethroned and all interests are increasingly subordinated to the public interest.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Corporations are themselves assuming a public character andfunction like mini States but surely they will not be allowed to function as slave States where thevoice of the slave may never be heard.20.I may conclude by a reference to the following observations made in another connection by D.A.Desai, J in Panchmahals Steel Ltd. v. Universal Steel Traders(1)."Time-honoured approach that the company law must safeguard the interest of investors andshareholders of the company would be too rigid a framework in which it can now operate.

Learned counsel has submitted that the Company Law inIndia is the same as in the Company Law in England. The law cited may be good law for Englandwith altogether a different system of economy ; but is abhorrent to India, particularly after theConstitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, by which the "Socialist" and "Secular" concepts havebeen added and incorporated into the Preamble of our Constitution. Our `Democratic Republic' isno longer merely `Sovereign' but is also `Socialist' and `Secular'. A Democratic Republic is nothttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Socialist if in such a Republic the workers have no voice at all.Our Constitution has expressly rejected the old doctrine of the employers' right to `hire and fire'.The workers are no longer ciphers ; they have been given pride of place in our economic system. Theworkers' right to be heard in a winding-up proceeding has to be spelt out from the Preamble andArticles 38 and 43-A of the Constitution and from the general principles of natural justice.13.It is pertinent to note the dissenting views of Hon'ble Mr.Justice E.S.Venkataramiah and Hon'bleMr.Justice Amarendra Nath Sen, which reads as under:35.That a company, the Official Liquidator, the liquidator, creditors andcontributories alone can effectively participate in and contest the winding-upproceedings is clear from some of the other provisions of the Act governing thewinding-up proceedings. Under section 450(2) of the Act before appointing aprovisional liquidator, the Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ has to givennotice to the company and give a reasonable opportunity to it to make itsrepresentations, if any, unless, for special reasons to be recorded in writing, the Courtthinks fit to dispense with such notice. The Court may, under section 466 of the Act atany time after making a winding-up order, on the application either of the OfficialLiquidator or of any creditor or contributory, make an order staying the winding-upproceedings on being satisfied that there are good reasons to pass such an order.Section 478(3) authorises any creditor or contributory in addition to the OfficialLiquidator to take part in the public examination of promoters, directors etc. held forthe purpose of enquiring into the conduct of such promotees or directors inconnection with the promotion or formation or the conduct of the business of thecompany. Section 517 of the Act provides that in a voluntary winding-up, anarrangement entered into by the company and the creditors as provided therein isbinding on the creditors and any creditor or contributory who is aggrieved by sucharrangement may appeal to the Court. Under section 518,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ the liquidator or any contributory or any creditormay apply to the Court in a voluntary winding-up proceeding to determine anyquestion arising in the winding-up of a company. Under section 542 of the Act on theapplication of the Official Liquidator or the liquidator, or any creditor or contributoryFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/18of the company the Court may, if it thinks fit and proper so to do, declare that anypersons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of business of the companywith intent to defraud creditors or any other person shall be personally responsiblefor all or any of the debts or liabilities as the Court may direct. The Court can exercisepower to assess damages against delinquent directors of a company which is orderedto be wound-up under section 543 on the application of the Official Liquidator, or ofthe Liquidator, or of any creditor or contributory made within the prescribed time. Inthe case of a voluntary winding-up under section 546 any creditor or contributorymay apply to the Court with respect to exercise of any power by the liquidator undersection 546(1). Section 549(1) of the Act provides that at any time after the makinghttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ of an order for the winding-up of a company by orsubject to the supervision of the Court, any creditor or contributory of the companymay, if the Supreme Court, by rules prescribed so permit and in accordance with andsubject to such rules but not further or otherwise, inspect the books and papers of thecompany. Any creditor or contributory may under section 556 apply to the Court toenforce the duty of liquidator to make returns etc. These and other provisions of theAct show that only the company, the Official Liquidator, liquidator, creditors,contributories or the Registrar have a statutory right to participate as of right in thewinding-up proceedings as provided in the Act. The workers or their trade unionshave not been given any such right.36.The words 'every person' in Rule 34 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 (which is almostsimilar to the corresponding English Rule) do not entitle a worker who is neither a shareholder nora contributory to support or oppose a winding-up petition under that Rule because they refer only toa person who is otherwise entitled to do so https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ under the Act. Weshould also bear in mind that an anamolous result that may flow from the acceptance of the case ofthe workers is that whereas in a winding-up by Court they may get an opportunity to contest thepetition, the voluntary winding-up proceedings or winding-up under the supervision of the Courtwould go on without any such contest although in all cases ultimately the workers will be dischargedfrom service. A construction which leads to such a discriminatory result should be avoided.37.When once we extend the right to contest a winding-up petition to workers either on theprinciple of equity or of administrative law, on the same principle it would logically follow that allothers who may have dealings with such as commission agents, selling agents etc. whose contractswith the company are going to be terminated by reason of its liquidation also have to be allowed tocontest the winding- up proceedings. Such a claim is not permissible. On this question, it may beuseful to refer to the case of Ex Parte Maclure. In that case a person entered into an agreement withan insurance https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ company to act as their agent for five years, and totransact no business except for the company, in consideration of which he was to receive a fixedsalary and also a commission of 10 percent, on all business transacted. Before the five years expiredthe company was wound up voluntarily. It was held, affirming the decision of Romilly M.R., that theagent was not entitled to prove against the company for the loss of his commission during theremainder of the term of five years. James L.J. said:Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/19"I am clearly of opinion that the Master of the Rolls was right.....It is the case of a person engaging aservant, and saying, 'I engage you for five years, I will pay you 500 a year for that period-that sum issecured to you-and then, in order to give you an inducement to carry on the business effectually,properly, and prudently, I will give you 10 per cent, commission upon the net profits to be earned bythat business. I am of opinion that this was a contract which did not give the servant the right todetermine what the extent of the business was to be. He could not call upon thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ directors to issue new policies to accept new premium, or to takenew risks, if they were not minded to do it. He could not say, 'Such a person has brought in a policyof insurance, and you must accept that." Because if he had a right to say 'You must carry on thebusiness' he would also have a right tc say 'You must carry on the business in the usual and propermanner,' and that would be giving a servant the right of controlling the master in the mode in whichhe chose to carry on his business. Now, I am quite satisfied that the meaning of the contract wasnothing of the kind. It was never intended to give the servant the right of dictating as to the extent ofbusiness, whether more or less, or nothing, but be simply took the chance of the company finding ita profitable business and carrying it on. The company had a right to reduce the business to aminimum ; and if they had a right to reduce it to a minimum, they had a right to reduce it tonothing-as far as he was concerned."38.It is because of some doubts that had been expressed earlier about the continuance of theemployment of the employees of a company ordered to be compulsorilyhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ wound up that section 445(3) was enacted making it clear thatthe passing of the order of winding-up amounts to a notice of discharge of the employees concerned.Section 445(3) corresponds to the termination of service brought about by the abolition of a postunder a Government or by the closure of a business, neither of which as the law stands todayrequires compliance with the principles of natural justice. It may, however, attract section 25-FFF ofthe Industrial Disputes Act; 1947 in appropriate cases.39.In the Act, there are specific provisions dealing with the rights of employees of a company.Sections 417 to 420 of the Act deal with employees' securities and provident funds and clauses (b) to(f) of section 530(1) deal with preferential payments to be made to the employees of a company inliquidation from out of its assets. Section 635- B of the Act deals with the protection to which theemployees are entitled during investigation into the affairs of a company. Rule 152 of the Companies(Court) Rules, 1959 (read with Form No. 67) relates to proof of arrears ofhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ workmen's wages. The right to resist a winding-up petition is notone such right.40.It is true that public interest which may include within its scope interests of employees of acompany has to be kept in view by the Court as observed in Bhalchandra Dharmajee Makaji andOrs. v. Alcock, Ashdown and Co. Ltd. and Ors.(1) in exercising certain powers under the Act.Sections 388-B, 394, 396, 397 and 408 of the Act do refer to the concept of public interest. Theseprovisions deal with the power of the Central Government to remove managerial personnel fromoffice on the recommendation of the High Court, compromises, arrangements and reconstruction ofcompanies and power of the Court and the Government to prevent oppression or mismanagement ofaffairs of a company. They do not, however, state that trade unions can as of right intervene in theFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/20proceedings arising under them.41.....46.It has to be emphasised that the privilege of making suggestions to the Court in the publicinterest is different from the right to be impleaded as a party with thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ concomitant right to enter into contest with the other parties andof taking an order in appeal before higher courts. The latter right has to be conferred expressly bythe statute on any person who wishes to exercise it. Under the existing law, the workers or theirunions may make any suggestions to the Court at any stage but they cannot claim to be impleaded asparties to the winding-up petition as of right.51.As the law stands today, workers cannot contend that a factory owned by and individualproprietor, on his death, should not be divided amongst his heirs, even though they may lose theirjobs. They cannot resist a partition suit, in which one of the items of property in respect of whichrelief is claimed is the factory in which they are working, filed by a junior member of Hindu jointfamily against the manager contending that the said factory is the separate property of the managerand should not, therefore, be partitioned merely because they may be discharged from service in theevent of the suit being decreed. They cannot resist the suit for dissolution of a firm which owns thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ factory in which they are working even though at the distributionof the assets of the firm, the factory may have to be dismantle and sold. The position cannot bedifferent in the case of a company which is wound up by the Court. As the law stands today, theworkers in a factory owned by a company do not have any hand in the birth of a company, in itsworking during its existence and also in its death by dissolution. If the law expressly says that amemorandum of a company should be signed by some future employees of the company, or thatthere should be workers' representatives on its board of directors or that the company should not bewound up without consulting the wishes of the workers, then they can certainly claim all such rights.Workers' participation in the affairs of a company or the ushering in of an industrial democracy isquite a laudable object. That is the reason for enacting Article 43-A of the Constitution whichrequires the State to take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure theparticipation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisationsengaged in any industry. The Legislature has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ not taken anyconcrete steps in this regard. But, can the Court step in and introduce drastic amendments into thecompany law ? Surely, it cannot. Even though there is no express statement in our constitutional lawincorporating in it the doctrine of separation of powers, in the interpretation of the Constitution thisCourt has broadly adopted the said doctrine. (See Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain (1).Even though by virtue of its power of interpretation of law the Court in an indirect way is makinglaw, it should be stated that there are well recognised limitations on the power of the Court makinginroads into the legitimate domain of the Legislature. If the Legislature exceeds its power, this Courtsteps in. If the Executive exceeds its power, then also this Court steps in. If this Court exceeds itspower, what can people do ? Should they be driven to seek an amendment of the law on every suchoccasion ? The only proper solution is the observance of restraint by this Court in itspronouncements so that they do not go beyond its own legitimate sphere.Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/21https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/52.It is true that there are now new kinds of weapons like consumers' protection agitations againstbig companies whose activities are likely to affect the life of the community adversely. But, for thoseagitations to be effective the Legislature should wake up and make appropriate laws under which theconsumers can bring action against erring companies. In the absence of any such law, this Courtcannot issue directions to the companies on the basis of complaints from the members of the public.59.These orders show that the High Court has kept in its view the interests of workers while givingdirections in the case from time to time and that there is no longer any ground to complain about.According to the petitioners in the winding-up petition the occasion for the complaint of the workershad been cleverly engineered by the contesting respondents. Be that as it may, as the orders of theHigh Court stand today the workers can always approach it by way of a company application forappropriate orders whenever they feel that their working conditions arehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ adversely affected during the pendency of the proceedings. It isnot necessary that the workers or the trade unions should be impleaded as parties to the CompanyPetition enabling them to contest the winding-up petition. Their presence on record is not necessaryfor complete and effectual adjudication of the winding-up petition. The trade unions are, therefore,neither necessary nor proper parties to the winding-up petition on the facts and in thecircumstances of this case including the element of public interest involved in any liquidationproceeding.62.Moreover, it is difficult even though it may not be impossible to administer the company law as itis now in force in India without the aid of the principles laid down by some of the leading Englishcases like Salomon v. Salomon & Co.(1) laying down the principle of corporate personality, AshburyRailway Carriage & Iron Co. v. Riche(2) dealing with the rule of ultra vires, Royal British Bank v.Turguand(3) laying down the rule of `indoor management', Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd. v. Heller &Partners Ltd.(4) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ which establishes the liability for negligentmis-statements in prospectuses, Foss v. Harbottle(1) and Burland v. Earle(2) dealing with theprinciple of `the fraud on a minority' and Ebrahimi v. Westbourne Galleries(3) dealing with theapplication of the `just and equitable' principle in ordering the winding-up of a company. A readingof the decision of this Court in Needle Industries (India) Ltd. & Ors. v. Needle Industries Newey(India) Holding Ltd. & Ors.(4) rendered by Chandrachud, C.J. shows the importance of foreigndecisions in deciding case arising under the Indian Company law which out of necessity has to keeppace with the well established principles prevailing in many other parts of the world for sustaininginternational trade and commerce. Adoption of an universal system of mercantile law and obedienceto the conventions of the International Labour Organisation constitute two important compulsionsof modern international economic life. It may be that the workers who are likely to be affected by thewinding-up need a larger protection. That can be done only by legislative action. This Court cannot,however, make any order which https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ will conflict with the existinglaw.72.I have earlier observed that the arguments advanced from the Bar on behalf of the trade unionshave been noted at length by my learned brothers Bhagwati and Venkataramiah, JJ. The argumentsFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/22no doubt express noble sentiments which I share ; but, in my opinion, the arguments fail toestablish that the employees have a right to appear and be heard in a petition presented to a Courtfor the winding up of a company. If the right is to be conceded to employees on these grounds itmust logically follow that every employee of a company, whether he is a worker within the meaningof the Industrial Disputes Act or he is a member of the management staff, must enjoy the same rightto appear and be heard in every such proceeding for the winding up of the company. An order forwinding up affects all the employees of a company, whether they are workers belonging to any tradeunion or not or whether they are officers of the company, high or low, not being members of anyunion or association. Further if the right to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ participate in awinding up proceeding is to be judged from the view point of the interest of any party who may beprejudicially affected as a result of an order of winding up being made, various other parties whohave trade relations with the company must necessarily be held to have the same right to be heard ina winding up proceeding. It is common knowledge that various persons, apart from the employeesof the company, also depend for their survival on the supplies of various materials, ingredients andcomponents to the company and with the liquidation of a company, all such persons who aremaking their living out of their dealings with the company have to go without occupation and haveto face disaster. Persons having existing contracts with the company are also seriously prejudicedwhen an order of winding up of the company is made.73.If the test of injury and adversely affecting the interests are considered to be sufficient to entitle aparty to a hearing in a proceeding on the footing that they are persons aggrieved, no suit fordissolution of a partnership can also be decided without impleading the employees of thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ firm and various other parties having trade relations with thefirm, as the dissolution of a firm may prejudicially affect the interests of the employees or thevarious other persons dealing with the firm.76.It has to be borne in mind that apart from the right of the Court to order the winding up of acompany in an appropriate case, the Act recognises that a company may go into liquidation withoutany intervention by the Court and also under the supervision of Court, provided the necessaryconditions laid down in the Act in this regard are complied with. Where the Company goes intoliquidation without reference to court or under the supervision of the Court, the employees of thecompany who have to meet the same fate of losing their employment, as and when the company iswound up by the Court, do not and cannot have any voice or say in the procedure to be adopted forthe liquidation of the company.77.In the case of winding up of any company by Court, the parties who can move the Court forwinding up https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ of the company are specifically mentioned in the Actand only such persons are competent to present the winding up petition. The procedure to befollowed on such a petition for winding up of the company being presented to court and the partieswho are entitled to be heard on the petition are dealt with and provided for in the Act and the Rules.The right of appearance and of being heard in a winding up proceeding has been conferred onpersons whom the Legislature considered to be necessary or proper parties for effective adjudicationof the proceeding before the Court. The Act provides that a creditor to whom a company is indebtedin a sum exceeding Rs. 500 and whose debt has not been paid by the company notwithstanding theFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/23statutory notice being served on the company is entitled to present a petition for the winding up ofthe company and in such a case, the creditor whose debt cannot be properly disputed, is entitled toan order of winding up on the ground of insolvency of the company. If a company is commerciallyinsolvent and is unable to pay its debts, the company has necessarily to be wound up and theemployees of the company can have https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ hardly anything to say insuch a case for assisting the Court in deciding the matter.78....85.I, however, wish to make it clear that although an employee of a company as an employee of acompany cannot claim to appear and be heard in a petition for winding-up of the company as amatter of right, yet in any appropriate case the Court in a winding-up proceeding may require orpermit any employee to appear at any stage of a winding-up proceeding and hear him, if the Courtbe of the opinion that the employee or the employees should be heard in the interests ofadministration of justice and for proper disposal of any matter. It appears that in this very case, theCourt at an earlier stage of the proceeding had, in fact, heard the employees and redressed their justgrievance.14.From the above judgment, it can be clearly seen that the workers all the more can have right toapproach the Company Court before initiation of winding up of proceeding and it is for theCompany Court either to entertain the application or to reject it. In that matter, the workers have nohttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ right to notice. After the initiation of the proceedings, it shall beproceeded only within the boundaries of the statute i.e., Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) andthe workers can have no right. Only when it comes to the preferential right of payment of their dues,they can raise their voice. In the present case, no such order has been challenged. The relief soughtfor is only against action apprehended to be taken by Resolution Professional, but not against anyorder of NCLT without jurisdiction or power. Therefore, there being no violation as to exercise ofjurisdiction or non-exercise of available jurisdiction, this Court cannot interfere in the CorporateInsolvency Resolution Process.15.In the judgment relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner in KAMAL K. SINGH VS.UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS [2020 (154) CLA 213 (BOM)] the Bombay High Court dealt withthe issue of nullity. In that case, the order, without being formally pronounced in the open Courtand without notice to the Corporate Debtor came to be passed and communicated to the parties. TheCorporate Resolution Professional has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ acted on the basis of theorder. In that circumstances, the Bombay High Court had interfered with the erroneous exercise ofpower by National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai and declared it as nullity.16.As observed above, when power vested with the Tribunal is exercised, in contravention of thesettled procedure laid down in the statute and in contravention of the principles of natural justiceand transgressing all norms with an ulterior motive, it will fall under the purview of judicial reviewand the High Court can exercise its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The saidcase is not applicable to the case on hand.Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/2417.The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court inEMBASSY PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS PVT. LTD., VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS[2019 (17) SCALE 37] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the matter which fall under thepublic law of domain. In that case, extension of mining lease, which is governed by the Mines andMinerals (Development and Regulation) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Act, 1957, wherein theGovernment has the power to extend the lease in public interest was put to the jurisdiction of NCLT.The NCLT, without having jurisdiction to decide the matters falling under the public law domain,exercised judicial review, which is considered as error of jurisdiction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court,has held that when the disputes revolve around the decisions of statutory or quasi-judicialauthorities, it can be corrected only by way of judicial review of administrative action. The NCLT orNCLAT cannot have jurisdiction over the same. Therefore, in the instant case, even though it iscontended that the life and liberty of 600 employees and their families, this will not fall under thepublic law domain to exercise the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution ofIndia in view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Textile Workers'Union case (cited supra).18.Even assuming that the petitioners have a right to agitate the same, entitled to agitate the illegalmethods adopted by the Corporate Resolution Professional and Committee of Creditors, it canagitate only https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Against the order of NCLT, there is a provision of appeal to National Company Law AppellateTribunal (NCLAT) is available. Without exhausting the alternative remedy, the petitioners cannotstraight away approach this Court.19.In the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in UNITED BANK OF INDIA VS. SATYAWATITONDON AND OTHERS [2010 (8) SCC 110] it is categorically held that the High Court shall notexercise the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution without exhausting the alternativeremedy and on the issues involving disputed facts. In the said judgment, it is observed as under:43.Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law that the High Court willordinarily not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effectiveremedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with greaterrigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of publichttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ money and the dues of banks and other financialinstitutions. In our view, while dealing with the petitions involving challenge to theaction taken for recovery of the public dues, etc., the High Court must keep in mindthat the legislations enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures for recovery of suchdues are code unto themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensiveprocedure for recovery of the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi judicialbodies for redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved person. Under the Insolvencyand Bankruptcy Code, the role of Tribunal does not gets over only with recoveringmoney, but also continue in disbursing the same whoever is entitled to the order ofpreference. Therefore, in so far as the entitlement of the petitioners is concerned, itfalls within the exclusive domain of National Company Law Tribunal. Therefore also,the Writ Petitions are not maintainable, without exhausting the effective remediesFive Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/25available to the petitioners.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/20.It is pertinent to note that in an earlier round of litigation, this Court in M/S.CAPEINFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LIMITED VS.M/S.NUPOWER RENEWABLES PRIVATE LIMITED [CRP (PD) NO.2864 OF 2017 DECIDED ON24.11.2017] directed the petitioner to approach the NCLT with a direction to entertain the appeal orapplication to dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible.21.In such circumstances, the above Writ Petitions challenging the apprehended action ofResolution Professional, pursuant to the order of NCLT, which order has been passed as per thepower vested in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and without exhausting the alternative remedyavailable to the petitioners, are not maintainable. However, liberty is granted to the petitioners toapproach the appropriate judicial Forum.                                                                                             22.01.2021                    Index          : Yes/No                    Internet       : Yes/No                    Note           : Issue order copy on 27.01.2021                    TKhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/                    Secretary to Government                    Labour & Employment Department                    Govt. of Tamil Nadu                    Fort St. George,                    Chennai  600 009.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/26                                                                TK                                   WP SR NOS.3786 AND 3789 OF 2021                                                         22.01.2021https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Five Member Committee Of ... vs Tourism Finance Corporation Of ... on 22 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161808316/27
