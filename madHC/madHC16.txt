They wanted the petitioner to provide Engineering,Procurement and Consultation services. A letter of intent (LOI) dated 10.02.2017 was signedbetween them. When the project work was more than midway, disputes arose between the two. Thepetitioner was shown the door and the third respondent completed the work by engaging theservices of another company. While the petitioner would claim that they have not been paid theirentire dues, the third respondent would contend that they have paid more than what the petitionerwas entitled to and that they have counter claim. This issue however does not fall within the scope ofthese writ petitions.2.The power generated in any generating unit will have to be transmitted to the sub stationmaintained by TANGEDCO. To enable this transmission, there will have to be an electric supply linefor point to point transmission. They are known as http://www.judis.nic.in dedicated transmissionlines. In the case on hand also, such dedicated transmission line was erected and the powergenerated by the petitioner is being transmitted. The dedicated transmission lines is having theS.J.Engineers Renewable Energy ... vs The Chief Engineer on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3979703/2capacity to carry 15 MW power supply. As on date, the infrastructure created in the form ofdedicated transmission line is being grossly under utilized. The third respondent had entered intoagreements with third parties for sharing the said infrastructurral facility. This has been approvedby the first respondent by issuing the impugned proceedings. The permission granted by the firstrespondent in favour of Shankar Abodes Solar Pvt Ltd has been put to challenge in these writpetitions at the instance of the writ petitioner.3.The writ petitions were entertained and an interim order was also granted. To vacate the same,M/s.Shankar Abodes Solar Pvt Ltd., has filed a petition. TANGEDCO has also filed its counteraffidavit and called upon this court to sustain the impugned proceedings.4.The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated all the contentions set out in the affidavits filed insupport of the writ http://www.judis.nic.in petitions and wanted this Court to set aside the ordersimpugned in these writ petitions.4.The learned counsel appearing for the third respondent would draw my attention to the relevantprovisions in the Electricity Act, 2003, in particular, Sections 2(16), 2(72), 7, 10, 14 of the Act. Theyread as follows :2(16).dedicated transmission lines" means any electric supply-line for point to pointtransmission which are required for the purpose of connecting electric lines orelectric plants of a captive generating plant referred to in section 9 or generatingstation referred to in section 10 to any transmission lines or sub-stations orgenerating stations, or the load centre, as the case may be.2(72).transmission lines" means all high pressure cables and overhead lines (notbeing an essential part of the distribution system of a licensee) transmittingelectricity from a generating station to another generating station or a substation,together with any step-up and step-down transformers, switch-gear and other worksnecessary to and used for the control of such cables or overhead lines, and suchbuildings or part thereof as may be required to accommodate such transformers,switch- gear and other works.7.(Generating company and requirement for setting up of generating station): Any generatingcompany may establish, operate and maintain a http://www.judis.nic.in generating station withoutobtaining a licence under this Act if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivitywith the grid referred to in clause (b) of section 73.10.(Duties of generating companies): --- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the duties of agenerating company shall be to establish, operate and maintain generating stations, tie-lines, sub-stations and dedicated transmission lines connected therewith in accordance with the provisions ofthis Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder.S.J.Engineers Renewable Energy ... vs The Chief Engineer on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3979703/3(2)A generating company may supply electricity to any licensee in accordance with this Act and therules and regulations made thereunder and may, subject to the regulations made under sub-section(2) of section 42, supply electricity to any consumer.(3)Every generating company shall -(a) submit technical details regarding its generating stations to the Appropriate Commission and theAuthority;(b)co-ordinate with the Central Transmission Utility or the State Transmission Utility, as the casemay be, for transmission of the electricity generated by it.14.(Grant of licence): The Appropriate Commission may, on an application made to it under section15, grant a licence to any person -(a) to transmit electricity as a transmission licensee;

His core argumentis that it is the duty of generating company to establish, operate and maintain dedicatedtransmission lines and pursuant to the said statutory duty, they have established the dedicatedtransmission lines in question. It is only the generating company that can establish a dedicatedtransmission line. EPC http://www.judis.nic.in contractor like the petitioner cannot independentlyestablish any dedicated line without getting license from TANGEDCO. He referred to Section 12 and14 of the Electricity Act, 2003 in this regard. He would also point out that approval had already beenissued in favour of the third respondent by TANGEDCO authorizing them to transmit power.Nowhere the right of the petitioner has been recognized. On account of the interim order granted bythis Court, the dedicated transmission line is now being grossly under utilized and that eventuallyharms public interest. He called upon this Court to vacate the interim order and to dismiss the writpetitions.6.I carefully considered the rival contentions and went through the materials on record. The onlyissue that arises for my consideration is as regards the ownership of the dedicated transmission linein question. I posed a direct question to the learned standing counsel as to whether the ownership ofthe dedicated transmission line should follow the ownership of the generating company. In otherwords, the question is whether there can be dichotomy in the matter of ownership between thegenerating company and that of the dedicated transmission line. http://www.judis.nic.in Thelearned standing counsel unambiguously informed the court that it is not necessary that the entityowning the generating company should also own the dedicated transmission line. But then, therehas to be a line sharing agreement between the two. This stand of TANGEDCO completelyS.J.Engineers Renewable Energy ... vs The Chief Engineer on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3979703/5undermines the contention put forth by the learned counsel appearing for the third respondent. Infact, a careful perusal of Section 10 of the Electricity Act, 2003 only indicates that what has beenmandated is that a generating company should establish operate and maintain the dedicated lines.It does not state that the ownership should also vest cast with the generating company.7.It appears to be beyond dispute that all over Tamil Nadu, there are several line sharing agreementsbetween generating companies and the entities owning dedicated transmission lines.8.Having noted this legal and factual position, the next question that arises for my consideration iswhether as to who owns the dedicated transmission line in question. I am afraid that this issueregarding title cannot be decided in writ proceedings. http://www.judis.nic.in They necessarilyinvolve a factual investigation. I am of the view that though the standing counsel on instructionscontends that Shankar Abodes owning the dedicated lines also. TANGEDCO also cannot go into thistitle issue. It is entirely best decided by the jurisdictional civil court. Of course, in the case on hand,there is an arbitration clause in the agreement entered into between the parties. But then,TANGEDCO is not a party to the same. The writ petitioner points out that they have placed a host ofmaterials before TANGEDCO to show that they had erected the transmission line and that they ownthe same.8.The learned counsel for the petitioner would draw my attention to the provisions of the CentralElectricity Authority (Technical Standards for Connectivity to the Grid) Regulations, 2007. Clause 7of the said regulations reads as under :7.Site Responsibility Schedule (1)A Site Responsibility Schedule (SRS) for everyconnection point shall be prepared by the owner of the substation where connectionis taking place.(2)Following information shall be included in the Site Responsibility Schedule, namely,-- (a)Schedule of electrical apparatus services and http://www.judis.nic.in supplies; (b) Schedule oftelecommunications and measurement apparatus; and (c) Safety rules applicable to each plant andapparatus.(3)Following information shall also be furnished in the Site Responsibility Schedule for each item ofequipment installed at the connection site, namely:-- (a) the ownership of equipment; (b) theresponsibility for control of equipment; (c) the responsibility for maintenance of equipment; (d) theresponsibility for operation of equipment; (e) the manager of the site; (f) the responsibility for allmatters relating to safety of persons at site; and(g) the responsibility for all matters relating to safety of equipment at site.9.Since I have held that a title dispute of this nature cannot be adjudicated by the first respondent,the parties have to be relegated to move the jurisdictional civil court. I consciously refrain fromdeciding as to whether the issue has to be resolved through arbitration. Whether it has to beresolved through arbitration or through civil court is an issue I leave open.S.J.Engineers Renewable Energy ... vs The Chief Engineer on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3979703/610.The final question that arises for my consideration is as to whether till the title dispute isresolved, the status quo as on date should continue. I am clearly of the opinion that it cannot behttp://www.judis.nic.in so. When a common infrastructural facility has been created, it should beput to its fullest use and capacity. The dedicated transmission lines are said to be having carryingcapacity of 15 MW. The Superintending Engineer (Non-conventional Energy Sources), Udumalpethas given a report stating that the cost of erection of 33 KV breaker and allied works at Ayyarmalai110/33-11 KV Substation is Rs.23,27,750/- and the total cost of estimate sanctioned for erection of33 KV feeder line from breaker and to plant end will be Rs.60,83,400/-. Thus, the total cost comesto Rs.84,11,150/-. The agreement between the parties contemplates establishing a 2.2 MW solarpower plant. Shankar Abodes being the first developer, the proceedings rightly mentioned the nameof Shankar Abodes. The dispute is only as regards the utilisation of the balance capacity of the feederline from breaker end to plant end to the extent of 13 MW. The third respondent states that atpresent they are using the said dedicated transmission line to the extent of 5 MW. Shankar Abodeshas entered agreements with M/s.Sri Parvathi Angalamman Mill Private Limited so that they canshare the said dedicated transmission line for transmitting 1 MW. That still leaves us with a balanceof 9 MW.http://www.judis.nic.in11. The learned counsel appearing for the third respondent on instructions states that withoutprejudice to their claim that the dedicated transmission line in question is actually owned by them.The third respondent shall deposit a sum of Rs.60,00,000/- in an account to be created for thepurpose within a period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It will haveto be an interest bearing account in a nationalised bank. The office of the second respondent shall beassociated in the creation of the said account. All that he requests is that on remittance of theamount of Rs.60,00,000/- in the said account, TANGEDCO should sanction the utilisation of thededicated transmission line for transmitting the remaining 9 MW(over and above the existing5+1MW being transmitted) by them. It is open to either parties to move the jurisdictional civil Courtor avail the arbitral remedy for establishing their claim of ownership over the dedicatedtransmission line in question. The appropriation or withdrawal of the amount of Rs.60,00,000/- tobe deposited by the third respondent in the account in question will abide by the outcome of the suitproceedings. The orders impugned in these writ petitions are interfered to the limitedhttp://www.judis.nic.in extent as mentioned above.12. These writ petitions are disposed of with the following directions:-a) On depositing a sum of Rs.60,00,000/- in the account to be created for the purpose, the officialrespondents are directed to grant requisite permission in favour of Shankar Abodes for utilisation ofthe dedicated transmission line in question for the remaining capacity.b) Without casting any aspersion on the petitioner, I restrain the petitioner from interfering with theutilisation of the aforesaid common infrastructural facility by the third respondent.S.J.Engineers Renewable Energy ... vs The Chief Engineer on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3979703/7c) The rights of the parties will abide by the eventual result of the civil/arbitral proceedings. TheCourt/Forum will adjudicate the issue without being uninfluenced in any manner by any of theobservations made in this order. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
