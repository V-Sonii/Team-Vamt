Anticipatory Bail – While granting bail, especially anticipatory bail which is per se extraordinary in nature, the possibility of the accused to influence prosecution witnesses, threatening the family members of the deceased, fleeing from justice or creating other impediments in the fair investigation, ought not to be overlooked. Vipan Kumar Dhir v. State of Punjab https://pdf.caselaw.in/?p=256Anticipatory Bail – Absconder – Even if there was any procedural irregularity in declaring the Accused as an absconder, that by itself was not a justifiable ground to grant pre­arrest bail in a case of grave offence.
