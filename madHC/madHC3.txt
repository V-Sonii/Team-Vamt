Heard both sides and perused the materials available on record.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.3732 of 20224. It is seen from the First Information Report that there are specific allegation as against thepetitioners, which has to be investigated. Further the FIR is not an encyclopedia and it need notcontain all facts. Further, it cannot be quashed in the threshold. This Court finds that the FIRdiscloses prima facie commission of cognizable offence and as such, this Court cannot interfere withthe investigation. The investigating machinery has to step in to investigate, grab and unearth thecrime in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the Code.5. It is also relevant to rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India passed inCrl.A.No.255 of 2019 dated 12.02.2019 - Sau. Kamal Shivaji Pokarnekar vs. the State of Maharashtra& ors., as follows:-"4. The only point that arises for our consideration in this case is whether the HighCourt was right in setting aside the order by which process was issued. It is settledlaw that the Magistrate, at the stage of taking cognizance and summoning, is requiredto apply his judicial mind only with a view to taking cognizance of the offence, or inother words, to find out whether a prima facie https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisCrl.O.P.(MD)No.3732 of 2022 case has been made out for summoning the accusedpersons. The learned Magistrate is not required to evaluate the merits of the materialor evidence in support of the complaint, because the Magistrate must not undertakethe exercise to find out whether the materials would lead to a conviction or not.5. Quashing the criminal proceedings is called for only in a case where the complaintdoes not disclose any offence, or is frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive. If theallegations set out in the complaint do not constitute the offence of which cognizancehas been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the High Court to quash the same. It isnot necessary that a meticulous analysis of the case should be done before the Trial toChithambaram vs State Represented By on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89953088/2find out whether the case would end in conviction or acquittal. If it appears on areading of the complaint and consideration of the allegations therein, in the light ofthe statement made on oath that the ingredients of the offence are disclosed, therewould be no justification for the High Court to interfere.6.........7.........8........https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.3732 of 20229. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel and examined the material on record, we are of theconsidered view that the High Court ought not to have set aside the order passed by the Trial Courtissuing summons to the Respondents. A perusal of the complaint discloses that prima facie, offencesthat are alleged against the Respondents. The correctness or otherwise of the said allegations has tobe decided only in the Trial. At the initial stage of issuance of process it is not open to the Courts tostifle the proceedings by entering into the merits of the contentions made on behalf of the accused.Criminal complaints cannot be quashed only on the ground that the allegations made therein appearto be of a civil nature. If the ingredients of the offence alleged against the accused are prima faciemade out in the complaint, the criminal proceeding shall not be interdicted."6. In view of the above discussion, this Court is not inclined to quash the First Information Report.Hence, this Criminal Original Petition stands dismissed.
