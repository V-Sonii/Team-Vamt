Thus, no writ is maintainable in view of the principles laid down by theLarger Bench of the High Court of Madras in the case of K.Marappan vs. The Deputy Registrar ofCo-operative Societies, reported in 2006 4 (CTC) 689. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has alsoemphasized that when the order under challenge is not issued by a State, writ remedy is notavailable and those orders are to be challenged in the manner known to law.4. In the present case, the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act provides an efficacious remedy forre-dressal of the grievances. More specifically, Section 153 provides a revision of the orders passedby the Management of the Co-operative Society. Therefore, the petitioner has to approach theRevisional Authority for an effective adjudication or disputed issues with reference to thedocuments and evidences. However, without exhausting the statutory remedy contemplated underthe Act, the Writ need not be entertained._________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD) No.3292 of 20225.
