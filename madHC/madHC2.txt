Kannadasan, aged about26 years. The detenu has been detained by the second respondent by his order inCr.M.P.No.04/2021, dated 6.8.2021, holding him to be a "Goonda", as contemplated under Section2(f) of Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982. The said order is under challenge in this Habeas Corpus Petition.2.We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional Public Prosecutorappearing for the respondents. We https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis have also perused the recordsproduced by the Detaining Authority.3.Though several grounds have been raised in the Habeas Corpus Petition, the learned counselappearing for the petitioner would mainly focus his argument on the ground that there is grossviolation of procedural safeguards, which would vitiate the detention. The learned counsel, byplacing authorities, submitted that the representations made by the petitioner were not consideredon time and there was an inordinate and unexplained delay with regard to the same.4.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the Habeas Corpus Petition. He would submitthat though there was delay in considering the representation, on that score alone, the impugneddetention order cannot be quashed. According to the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, noprejudice has been caused to the detenu and thus, there is no violation of the fundamental rightsguaranteed under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India.5.The Detention Order in question was passed on 06.08.2021. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Thepetitioner made a representation, dated 17.08.2021 and the same was received on 23.08.2021.Thereafter, remarks were called for by the Government from the Detaining Authority on24.08.2021. Thereafter, the Government considered the matter and passed an order rejecting thepetitioner's representation on 20.10.2021. Though the representation, dated 17.08.2021 wasreceived on 23.08.2021, it was rejected only on 20.10.2021 with a delay of 28 days, after excludingthe Government Holidays of 18 days. The delay in considering the representation remainsunexplained.6.In Rekha vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in 2011 (5) SCC 244, the Honourable Supreme Courthas held that the procedural safeguards are required to be zealously watched and enforced by theCourts of law and their rigour cannot be allowed to be diluted on the basis of the nature of thealleged activities undertaken by the detenu.7. In Sumaiya vs. The Secretary to Government, reported in 2007 (2) MWN (Cr.) 145, a DivisionBench of this Court has held that the unexplained delay of three days in disposal of therepresentation made on behalf of the detenu would be sufficient to set aside the order of detention.Banumathi vs The Additional Chief Secretary To ... on 22 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106359438/2https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis8. In Tara Chand vs. State of Rajasthan and others, reported in 1980 (2) SCC 321, the HonourableSupreme Court has held that any inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the Governmentin considering the representation renders the very detention illegal.9. In the subject case, admittedly, there is an unexplained delay of 28 days in considering therepresentation. The impugned detention order is, therefore, liable to be quashed.10. In the result, the Habeas Corpus Petition is allowed and the order of detention inCr.M.P.No.04/2021, dated 6.8.2021, passed by the second respondent is set aside. The detenu,namely, Rajadurai, son of Late. Kannadasan, aged about 26 years, is directed to be releasedforthwith unless his detention is required in connection with any other case.
