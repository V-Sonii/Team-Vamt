The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, involving in thebusiness of setting up power plants and generating electricity. The petitioner also had set up anatural gas based 8.8 MW power plant at Komal West Village, Nagapattinam District. The naturalgas is to be used as fuel at the petitioner's power plant i.e., supplied by the second respondent. Thefirst respondent has granted permission to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which wasselling gas directly to the consumers till 1992. Pursuant to the Government Policy, it was transferredto the second respondent/GAIL. The petitioner- Company had set up its natural gas based powerplant during April 2005. The entire natural gas supplied by the second respondent had been usedonly for the purpose of generation of power. However, originally, the petitioner had sought forallotment of natural gas for generation of power, which was to be utilised for manufacture of steel,which was to be set up by the petitioner. Hence, it is understood that the gas supply was required bythe petitioner for the purpose of generation of power for its proposed steel plant. On 23.12.1999, arequest for allocation of natural gas was made by the petitioner stating that the gas is for productionof power for utilising the same in its proposed steel plant. However, in the allotment letter dated05.06.2020, issued to the petitioner by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 3/29 W.P.No.13064of 2020 the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it is mentioned that the gas allotment is forSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/2manufacture in the steel plant. The letter of allocation dated 05.06.2000 had two conditions, ie., (i)the petitioner should pay the relevant transportation charges and (ii) the petitioner should enterinto a gas supply contract with the second respondent within 60 days, which means that there is nocondition with regard to use of gas.3. Accordingly, a contract dated 06.10.2000 came to be entered into between the petitioner and thesecond respondent. The said contract clearly stated that the gas is to be used for generation of powerfor use in the steel plant. It is stated that as proposed, the steel plant did not take off. Since the steelplant project was abandoned, the power generated in the plant using the gas allotted to thepetitioner, was sold to captive consumers including a steel plant using the state grid. It is stated thatthe subsequent amendment agreement dated 03.05.2003 with the second respondent categoricallystated that the gas allotted to the petitioner is for use of fuel at its power plant.4. The agreement period was originally for 10 years and subsequently, it was renewed from01.01.2011 till 31.12.2015 for a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 4/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020period of 5 years. The petitioner commenced drawal of gas alloted from April, 2005. The agreementdated 23.12.2010 also recognizes that the petitioner uses the gas as fuel for operating its powerplant. In fact, in the term of the agreement dated 23.12.2010, the respondents took a stand that thediscounted administered price mechanism was not available to natural gas supply to power plantssupplying power to captive consumers. Based on such a stand, the second respondent had issued ademand seeking differential price for past supply of natural gas. When a demand seeking differentialprice for past supply of natural gas was raised, the same was referred to arbitral proceedings and anaward, which partly allowed the demand made by the second respondent, was set aside by thisCourt. It is stated that though the said proceedings are not relevant, it is mentioned that, becausethe parties were aware of the fact that the gas was supplied only for the power plant, the petitionerwas always treated as a power sector industry.5. As the agreement dated 23.12.2010 provided for extension of term of supply, the petitioner soughtfor extension. Despite several reminders, there was no response from the second respondent. By aletter dated 20.12.2015, the second respondent sought for a clarification from the competentauthority with regard https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 5/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 toextending the terms of supply, as the petitioner had been using the natural gas for generation ofpower, instead of manufacture of steel.6. The petitioner also sent a representation on 21.12.2015 to the first respondent to clarify the sameto ensure continuity of gas supply after 31.12.2015. The petitioner has also filed a Writ Petition inW.P.No.41002 of 2015 seeking a direction to the first respondent to issue necessary clarification tothe second and third respondents to ensure continuous gas supply to petitioner's power plant, afterthe agreement period came to an end on 31.12.2015. The Interim Order dated 29.12.2015 granted bythis Court in W.P.No.41002 of 2015, restrained the second respondent from discontinuing the gassupply to the petitioner. The first respondent reported to this Court that the amendments in theagreements between the petitioner and the second respondent recognising the use of the gas by thepetitioner's power plant, was without the knowledge of the first respondent. Therefore, it is statedthat the use of gas for generation of power is unauthorised and the allocation is liable to beSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/3cancelled.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 6/29 W.P.No.13064 of 20207. Once again, the petitioner filed another Writ Petition in W.P.No.13619 of 2016 to forbear the firstrespondent from cancelling the allocation of natural gas. On 21.11.2019, this court had directed thefirst respondent to consider the petitioner's representations and pass orders and also directed thesupply of natural gas till the final decision is taken by the first respondent.8. Accordingly, the first respondent called upon the petitioner to attend the meeting on 07.03.2020,which was re-scheduled to 12.03.2020, which was attended by the petitioner's representative. Thepetitioner had also submitted a letter dated 11.03.2020, explaining the details relating to theallotment, the earlier agreements, the communications between the petitioner and the second andthird respondents etc. During the meeting held on 12.03.2020, the nation wide lock down wasannounced due to covid-19 pandemic and the petitioner also did not receive any response from therespondents.9. While so, on 11.09.2020, the petitioner received the impugned order from the first respondentthrough e-mail, whereby, the first respondent had cancelled the allotment of natural gas made to thepetitioner in the year 2000, based on which, the petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page7/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 had set up its power plant. It is submitted by the petitioner that themeeting, which the petitioner attended was before one Mr.Shyam Singh Mahar, Deputy Secretary(GP-II), Government of India, MOPNG. However, the impugned order had been issued byMr.Anand Kumar Jha, Deputy Secretary to Government of India, MOPNG. It is stated that theimpugned order is passed by an Officer, who had not conducted the hearing on 12.03.2020. Theimpugned order is challenged by the petitioner on several grounds including that of violation ofprinciples of natural justice.10. The first respondent had filed its counter affidavit stating that the amendments in thesubsequent agreements relied upon by the petitioner between the petitioner and the secondrespondent, are without the knowledge of the first respondent. The gas was alloted for the specificpurpose of manufacture of steel in the petitioner's proposed steel plant through its power plant. It isspecifically stated by the first respondent that the usage of allocation of gas cannot be changed. Thedeviation from the terms of allocation amounts to unauthorised use of gas, which is liable to becancelled.11. So far as the violation of principles of natural justice is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page8/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 concerned, it is stated that the order impugned is an administrativeorder/institutional decision of the first respondent, which has already been established by theHon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Kalinga Mining Corporation -vs- Union of India reported in2013 (5) SCC 252. Therefore, the petitioner cannot maintain the present Writ Petition.12. The second and third respondents also had filed the counter affidavit admitting the fact that thegas was alloted for the purpose of establishing steel plant only. Admittedly, till date, the petitionerSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/4has not established the steel plant, but, instead, utilising the gas supplied for the purpose ofgenerating power, which was sold to their customers for captive consumption. It is pointed out thatthe change of user from the petitioner did not fall within the present order of priority under theUnion Government's Policy of allocation.13. Before dealing with the merits of the case on the facts, the question of violation of principles ofnatural justice, as projected by the petitioner, has to be dealt with.14. The impugned order is challenged contending that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page9/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 factual aspects prior to the renewal request was not considered. Theoriginal allotment has been cancelled stating that the petitioner did not set up its steel plant and thegas supply was used for generating power, which is the purpose other than for which it was allotted.The fact of not setting up of the steel plant by the petitioner, is within the knowledge of the firstrespondent. Further, the original supply of gas was for the specific purpose of generating power andthis usage was never changed by the petitioner.15. The second reason for rejecting the request of the petitioner based on the change in gas usage isalso assailed by the petitioner. It is pointedly argued that the order of priority in 2020 could nothave been the basis for considering the case of the petitioner, as the allotment to the petitioner datesback to 2000 based on the then existing Policy under which power sector was priority sector. Hencethe petitioner cannot be treated as a fresh applicant for a fresh allotment. Therefore, the currentorder of priority cannot be a factor to reject the case of the petitioner and cancel the originalallotment dated 05.06.2000.16. The first respondent submitted that the supply of natural gas was approved on firm basis infavour of the petitioner only for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 10/29 W.P.No.13064 of2020 the manufacture of steel in the steel plant proposed to be set up in Kutthalam Zone, subject tothe condition that the gas would be used for the manufacture of steel only. The first respondent, videletter No.L-12011/5/01-GP(vii) dated 16.08.2001, approved the extension of contractual date ofdrawal by one year. Further, vide letters dated 28.04.2004 and 01.12.2004, the first respondentconveyed approval of the Government to extend the date of gas drawal to 30.06.2004 and31.12.2004 respectively.17. It is stated by the first respondent that in the Gas Supply Contract (GSC) dated 06.10.2000entered into between the second respondent and the petitioner for supply of 35,000 SCMD, theusage of gas had been modified as fuel for production of power for manufacture of steel in the steelplant. As per contract, the gas supply was to commence from 31.12.2002 and the contract was validupto 31.12.2010. Upon request by the second respondent, the first respondent approved theextension of the contractual date of gas supply directly by one year on 16.08.2001. Thereafter, anamendment to Gas Supply Contract was signed on 03.05.2003 between the second respondent andthe petitioner, in which, the usage of gas had been changed as for supply of gas for petitionersproposed power plant. The first respondent also conveyed the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Page 11/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 approval of the Government to extend the date of gas directly. Anamendment to gas supply contract was made on 21.02.2005 extending the gas drawal date toSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/531.12.2004. However, the usage of gas was again amended, as gas to be used as fuel for its powerplant. After the Gas Supply Contract expired on 31.12.2010, another GSTA (Gas Sales andTransmission Agreement) was executed on 23.12.2010, which was valid upto 31.12.2015. Even in thesaid GSTA dated 23.12.2010, it was mentioned that the petitioner owns and operates the powerplant using gas for industrial application as feed and/or fuel.18. The first respondent therefore specifically pleaded ignorance about the change of usage of gas ashas been carried out in the agreements without their knowledge. As of now, the current gasutilization Policy allocation is sector specific and priority to a particular sector had been accorded,based on its contribution to economy and policy of the Government.19. The learned counsel for the second respondent contended that the petitioner-Company hadadmittedly breached its own promise to set up a steel plant, on the basis of which, they soughtallocation of gas. Having failed to set up a steel plant for which theyhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 12/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 got allocation of gas, thepetitioner-Company cannot be permitted to take advantage of its own wrong. Mere fact that theallocation of order itself does not mention the purpose of the request, does not invalidate theimpugned order. It was further contended by the second respondent that despite several requests,the petitioner failed to produce the representation of the petitioner that the allocation letter hadbeen amended in respect of the purpose. As the petitioner failed to produce the same, the contractwas not renewed after 31.12.2015.20. The second respondent, being the distribution agent of the Government, cannot supply gascontrary to the terms of allocation, much less without an order of allocation. The second respondentfurther mentioned that it is bound by the Doctrine of Public Trust, which the petitioner hadbreached.21. The contention of the petitioner is that the act of the first respondent-Union of India, isarbitrary, because, though it was aware of the fact that the petitioner-Company was using the gas forgenerating the power, it never raised any issue. The petitioner- Company also had invested hugesums of money in setting up the power plant with continuous of supply of gas till 2015. While so,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 13/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 sudden revocation of thesame based on the ground that there is a major anomaly in the use of gas by the petitioner, isunacceptable. In fact, the second respondent recognized that the petitioner is supplying the powergenerated at the plant to the TNEB grid for supply to consumers. It is the stand of thepetitioner-Company that only when the petitioner-Company challenged the second respondentsattempt to retrospectively change the price of gas supplied in the past and initiated arbitration withregard to gas supply for generation of power instead of using it for manufacture of steel, which wasprojected as a major anomaly and hence refused to renew the contract.22. In the above backdrop of the case, it is time to consider the impugned order, which, according tothe petitioner-Company, did not consider any of the facts. The original allotment had been cancelledby stating that the petitioner did not set up a steel plant and that by using the gas for generatingpower, the petitioner has denied the allotment for different use. The learned counsel for theSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/6petitioner-Company argued that though the steel plant was not set up, which is a fact noted by thefirst respondent-Union of India, the allotment of gas itself is only for generating power, which wasto be used for steel plant. Therefore, when the petitioner had used thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 14/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 gas supply only for generatingpower, it cannot be said that the petitioner used it for a different purpose. Secondly, so far as thepriority prevailing in 2020 is concerned, the allotment of the petitioner dates back to 2000 and thePolicy prevailing in 2000 is applicable. Admittedly, it is not a fresh allotment made to the petitioner,but it is only a renewal or extension of the existing allotment. Hence, rejection of the petitioners caseis only an extraneous factor and that cannot be the reason for cancelling the allotment made in theyear 2000.23. Be that as it may, the impugned order is assailed on the ground of violation of principles ofnatural justice. It is alleged by the petitioner-Company that in its representation dated 11.03.2020that the second respondent-GAIL, New Delhi, had not been sharing the communications exchangedbetween the first respondent-Union of India and the second respondent-GAIL, New Delhi, withregard to the petitioner-Companys contract. As these documents reveal the factual position that therespondents were aware of the usage of the gas by the petitioner, though on 21.11.2019, this Courtdirected the first respondent to afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner before passing anyorders, the first respondent-Union of India had not heeded to the request of the petitioner-Companyfor furnishing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 15/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 the documentsto the petitioner-Company. Without the documents being furnished to the petitioner, there couldnot have been meaningful hearing, as directed by this Court. Hence, the petitioner-Company hasstated that, in the absence of the relevant documents, there was no proper hearing.24. Secondly, it is specifically pointed out that even assuming that there was a hearing, theimpugned order was not passed by the Officer, who conducted the hearing on 12.03.2020. Thepetitioner-Company was issued with notice to appear before Mr.Shri Shyam Singh Mahar, DeputySecretary, Government of India, MOPNG. Accordingly, the petitioner-Companys representativeappeared before the above said officer and submitted the representation dated 11.03.2020.However, the impugned order was passed by one Mr.Anand Kumar Jha, Deputy Secretary,Government of India, MOPNG, which is blatant violation of the principles of natural justice. Thesaid Officer never heard the petitioner before passing any order.25. In this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioner- Company relied on a decision of theSupreme Court reported in 2011 (2) SCC 258 [AUTONOTIVE TYRE MANUFACTURERShttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 16/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 ASSOCIATION VS THEDESIGNATED AUTHORITY AND OTHERS], wherein, in paragraphs 77, 80 to 84, it had been heldas follows:"77. It is trite that rules of natural justice are not embodied rules. The phrase naturaljustice is also not capable of a precise definition. The underlying principle of naturaljustice, evolved under the common law, is to check arbitrary exercise of power by theState or its functionaries. Therefore, the principle implies a duty to act fairly i.e. fairplay in action. In A.K. Kraipak [(1969) 2 SCC 262] , it was observed that the aim ofSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/7rules of natural justice is to secure justice or to put it negatively to preventmiscarriage of justice.80. It is thus, well settled that unless a statutory provision, either specifically or bynecessary implication excludes the application of principles of natural justice,because in that event the court would not ignore the legislative mandate, therequirement of giving reasonable opportunity of being heard before an order is made,is generally read into the provisions of a statute, particularly when the order hasadverse civil consequences which obviously cover infraction of property, personalrights and material deprivations for the party affected. The principle holds goodirrespective of whether the power conferred on a statutory body or Tribunal isadministrative or quasi-judicial. It is equally trite that the concept of natural justicecan neither be put in a straitjacket nor is it a general rule of universal application.81. Undoubtedly, there can be exceptions to the said doctrine. As stated above, the question whetherthe principle https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 17/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 has to be appliedor not is to be considered bearing in mind the express language and the basic scheme of theprovision conferring the power; the nature of the power conferred and the purpose for which thepower is conferred and the final effect of the exercise of that power. It is only upon a considerationof these matters that the question of application of the said principle can be properly determined.(See Union of India v. Col. J.N. Sinha [(1970) 2 SCC 458] .)82. In the light of the aforenoted legal position and the elaborate procedure prescribed in Rule 6 ofthe 1995 Rules, which the DA is obliged to adhere to while conducting investigations, we areconvinced that duty to follow the principles of natural justice is implicit in the exercise of powerconferred on him under the said Rules. Insofar as the instant case is concerned, though it wassought to be pleaded on behalf of the respondents that the incumbent DA had issued a commonnotice to the advocates for ATMA and Ningbo Nylon, for oral hearing on 9-3-2005, however, there isno document on record indicating that pursuant to ATMA's letter dated 24-1-2005, notice for oralhearing was issued to them by the incumbent DA. Moreover, the alleged opportunity of oral hearingon 9-3-2005, being in relation to the price undertaking offer by Ningbo Nylon, cannot be likened toa public hearing contemplated under Rule 6(6) of the 1995 Rules.83. The procedure prescribed in the 1995 Rules imposes a duty on the DA to afford to all the parties,who have filed objections and adduced evidence, a personal hearing before taking a final decision inthe matter. Even written arguments are no substitute for an oral hearing. A personal hearinghttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 18/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 enables the authorityconcerned to watch the demeanour of the witnesses, etc. and also clear up his doubts during thecourse of the arguments. Moreover, it was also observed in Gullapalli [AIR 1959 SC 308] , if oneperson hears and other decides, then personal hearing becomes an empty formality.84. In the present case, admittedly, the entire material had been collected by the predecessor of theDA; he had allowed the interested parties and/or their representatives to present the relevantinformation before him in terms of Rule 6(6) but the final findings in the form of an order wereSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/8recorded by the successor DA, who had no occasion to hear the appellants herein. In our opinion,the final order passed by the new DA offends the basic principle of natural justice. Thus, theimpugned notification having been issued on the basis of the final findings of the DA, who failed tofollow the principles of natural justice, cannot be sustained. It is quashed accordingly."26. The learned counsel for the petitioner-Company also relied on a judgment of the Supreme Courtreported in 2014 (6) SCC 564 [UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS VS- SHIV RAJ AND OTHERS],wherein, it has been held as follows:-"17. This Court in Gullapalli Nageswara Rao [Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v. A.P. SRTC,AIR 1959 SC 308] , held: (AIR p. 327, para 31) 31. Personal hearing enables theauthority concerned to watch the demeanour of the witnesses and clear uphttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 19/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 his doubtsduring the course of the arguments, and the party appearing to persuade theauthority by reasoned argument to accept his point of view. If one person hears andanother decides, then personal hearing becomes an empty formality. We thereforehold that the said procedure followed in this case also offends another basic principleof judicial procedure.18. This Court in Rasid Javed v. State of U.P. [(2010) 7 SCC 781 : AIR 2010 SC 2275]following the judgment in Gullapalli Nageswara Rao [Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v.A.P. SRTC, AIR 1959 SC 308] , held that: (Rasid Javed case [(2010) 7 SCC 781 : AIR2010 SC 2275] , SCC p. 796, para51) 51. a person who hears must decide and that divided responsibility is destructiveof the concept of judicial hearing is too fundamental a proposition to be doubted.19. A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Automotive TyreManufacturers Assn. v. Designated Authority [(2011) 2 SCC 258] , wherein this Courtdealt with a case wherein the designated authority (DA) under the relevant statutepassed the final order on the material collected by his predecessor-in-office who hadalso accorded the hearing to the parties concerned. This Court held that the orderstood vitiated as it offended the basic principles of natural justice.20. In view of the above, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that the veryperson/officer, who accords the hearing to the objector must also submit thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 20/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 report/take decision on theobjection and in case his successor decides the case without giving a fresh hearing, the order wouldstand vitiated having been passed in violation of the principles of natural justice."27. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the second and third respondents-GAIL had placedreliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 2013 (5) SCC 252 [Kalinga MiningCorporation vs- Union of India and Others]. It is useful to extract paragraphs 66 and 67 of the saidjudgment, as under:Saheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/9"66. Upon conclusion of the arguments by the parties, Mr.S.P.Gupta, Joint Secretarywho had heard the parties prepared the note running into 19 pages (from pp. 30-49)containing 47 paragraphs of original record. The note has been duly signed byMr.S.P. Gupta, Joint Secretary on 17-9- 2001. The High Court further noticed that infact this is the report which had been duly approved by the Secretary on 18-9-2001and by the Central Government Minister on 25-9-2001. While making theendorsement of the approval, the Secretary has written as under:I endorse fully the above note of the Joint Secretary.This is a very old case in which the parties have repeatedly recourse to the courts. Assuch (sic) even now near litigation may follow. Therefore the decision of the CentralGovernment has to be in terms of a speaking order which is backed by facts and law.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 21/29 W.P.No.13064 of 202067. The High Court further notices that the impugned Order dated 27-9-2001 is, infact, a verbatim copy of the report/note prepared by Mr.S.P.Gupta, Joint Secretary.Upon examination of the entire matter, the High Court has concluded that the Orderhas been signed by Mr R.P. Khatri merely to communicate the approval of the CentralGovernment to the parties."28. The above decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 2013 (5) SCC 252, is distinguishedby the learned counsel for the petitioner-Company pointing out that the minutes of the meeting on12.03.2020, which was reduced to writing in the form of record of discussion, was considered by theOfficer, who passed the order. In the absence of any material or record to substantiate the same, it isevident that the decision taken by the Officer is not the same Officer, who conducted the hearing on12.03.2020. Therefore, the dictum laid in the said decision reported in 2013 (5) SCC 252 is notapplicable to this case.29. So far as the Doctrine of Public Trust is concerned, in the absence of any evidence or materials toshow that there was any default on the part of the petitioner, the Doctrine of Public Trust isinapplicable.30. The impugned order dated 11.09.2020 was passed by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Page 22/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, namely Mr.AnandKumar Jha, whereas the representative of the petitioner-Company had appeared before oneMr.Shyam Singh Mahar, Deputy Secretary(GP-II) of the first respondent-Union of India. Pursuantto the directions given by this Court, the Government of India is hearing the petitioner-Company forthe purpose of renewal of the allocation of supply of gas. Though the petitioner was given a personalhearing, the same was not complete, as the necessary communications between the firstrespondent-Union of India and the second respondent-GAIL, New Delhi, were not furnished to thepetitioner-Company.Saheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/1031. Secondly, the same officer, who heard on 12.03.2020 had not passed the impugned order dated11.09.2020. Even presuming that the hearing given by Mr.Shyam Singh Mahar be deemed to be ahearing, the same is vitiated due to the fact that the orders were passed by one Mr.Anand KumarJha, when the hearing was not yet over on 12.03.2020. As the communications between the firstrespondent-Union of India and the second respondent-GAIL, New Delhi were not furnished to thepetitioner-Company, it should be deemed that the petitioner-Company was not even heard. Even if aGovernment, be it a State or Central, is an impersonal body and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Page 23/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 hearing through Machinery is prescribed by law and dischargingonly Administrative acts and not Judicial acts in the matter of approving the allocation of supply ofgas, the same Officer, who heard the matter, should have passed the final orders on the issue inquestion. The first respondent-Union of India had lost sight of the fact that if a statutory authorityhas power to do any act, which will prejudicially affect its subject, though there is no otherrespondents, but in this writ petition, the Union of India and GAIL are respondents. Any finaldetermination by the authorities of the first respondent-Union of India and the secondrespondent-GAIL, New Delhi, is quasi-judicial in nature, the authority is expected to act Judiciously.32. Admittedly, when the same officer, who heard the personal hearing, had not passed theimpugned order, the impugned order itself is vitiated and the same is liable to be set aside only onthat limited ground. Therefore, the order impugned is accordingly set aside, remitting the matterback to the first respondent-Union of India for fresh consideration. It is also open to thepetitioner-Company to file a fresh representation and the first respondent-Union of India and thesecond respondent-GAIL, New Delhi, are directed to furnish the required/relevant communicationshttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 24/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 between them with regard tothe issue in question, before the date of hearing, to the petitioner-Company. Once the petitioner-Company is furnished with the copy of the said communications within the reasonable time, thehearing may be held and the appropriate orders be passed, after affording an opportunity ofpersonal hearing to the petitioner-Company by permitting them to mark the documents andput-forth their arguments. However, the entire exercise has to be completed within a period of 12weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.33. So far as the claim of non-payment of money by the petitioner-Company, it is seen that pendingthe writ petition, pursuant to the interim order passed on 17.09.2020, the second and thirdrespondents have supplied gas to the petitioner-Company, for which the payment had not beenreceived from the petitioner- Company despite receipt of invoices. Hence, a memo was filed by thesecond and third respondents dated 08.12.2020. In response, a memo dated 14.12.2021 was filed onbehalf of the petitioner. The petitioner has stated that a total sum of Rs.42,35,432/- was charged asper the invoices raised by the second respondent. Out of which, a sum of Rs.28,92,478/- has beenrecovered by the second respondent by invoking the letter of credit issued by thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 25/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 petitioner-Company. Hence,there was a balance amount of Rs.13,80,994/- was pending, which according to the petitioner-Company, there was a dispute regarding the same. However, on 10.12.2020, thepetitioner-Company had received an intimation from its bank that the said remaining amount ofRs.13,80,994/- was also recovered by the second respondent on 07.12.2020 by invoking the letter ofcredit issued by the petitioner-Company. Therefore, it is recorded that the entire invoice amountSaheli Exports Pvt.Ltd vs The Union Of India on 7 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177722575/11raised by the second respondent for the supply of gas pursuant to the interim direction given by thisCourt has been received by the second respondent.34.

No costs.Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.07.01.2021 srn To1.The Union of India, Represented by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry ofPetroleum and Natural Gas, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 26/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020Shastri Bhawan, New Delhi - 110 001.2.GAIL (India) Limited, GAIL Building, 16, Bhikaji Cama Place, R.K.Puam, Ring Road, New Delhi -110 066.3.GAIL (India) Limited, Represented by Zonal General Manager, 7A, Kences Towers, No.1,Ramakrishna Street, North Usman Road, T.Nagar, Chennai - 600 017.PUSHPA SATHYANARAYANA, J.srn https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page 27/29 W.P.No.13064 of 2020 W.P.No.13064 of 2020and W.M.P.
