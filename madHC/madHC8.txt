Public Prosecutor.                                                      ORDERR.SUBRAMANIAN, J.AND N.SATHISH KUMAR, J.The petitioner is the detenu, namely, Perumal, S/o.Thembadi, aged about 58 years. The detenu hasbeen detained by the second respondent by his order in Detention Order No.18 of 2021, dated29.04.2021, holding him to be a "Sexual Offender", as contemplated under Section 2(ggg) of TamilNadu Act 14 of 1982. The said order is under challenge in this Habeas Corpus Petition.2. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional PublicProsecutor appearing for the respondents. We have also perused the records produced by theDetaining Authority.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD) No.1421 of 20213.The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the detention order has been passedwithout considering the materials in a proper perspective, which resulted in non-application ofmind on the part of the detaining authority.4.A perusal of the records would show that the detaining authority has considered the grant of bailby the similarly placed persons in Crime No.2 of 2021. Normally, bails are granted taking note of thefacts and circumstances of the particular case. Therefore, the facts of the other case cannot bemechanically considered to the given case to pass orders.The Detaining Authority held that since in some other case bail was granted, the same was alsoapplied to the present case and the detenu is likely to be enlarged on bail, which shows the clear nonapplication of mind on the part of the Detaining Authority in passing the Detention Order.Further, it is seen that the detention order as against the co-accused has been quashed by this Courtin H.C.P(MD)No.1252 of 202. Hence, on these grounds, the detention order is liable to be quashed.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD) No.1421 of 20215. In the result, the Habeas Corpus Petition is allowed and the order of detention in Detention OrderNo.18 of 2021, dated 29.04.2021, passed by the second respondent is set aside. The detenu, namely,Perumal, S/o.Thembadi, aged about 58 years, is directed to be released forthwith unless hisdetention is required in connection with any other case.
