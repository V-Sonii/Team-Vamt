Madras High CourtDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021                                                                              O.P.No.38 of 2021                                   IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS                                                      Dated : 27.01.2021                                                          CORAM:                                      THE HONOURABLE Mr.JUSTICE M.SUNDAR                                                      O.P.No.38 of 2021                  Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel                                                                                   ...

Chief Justice, High Court of                  Delhi in Arbitration Case No.1 of 2019 Award dated 24.10.2020.                                     For Petitioner     : Ms.Gladys Daniel                                                             ***                 1/28https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/                                                      ORDERCaptioned 'Original Petition' ['OP' for the sake of brevity] is an application under Section 34 of 'TheArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act No.26 of 1996)', hereinafter 'A and C Act' for the sake ofbrevity, convenience and clarity. Captioned OP has been filed assailing an 'arbitral award dated24.10.2020 bearing reference Arbitration Case No.1 of 2019' [hereinafter 'impugned award' for theDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/1sake of brevity], which has been made by an 'Arbitral Tribunal' ['AT' for the sake of brevity]. To benoted, AT was constituted by a sole Arbitrator.2. Ms.Gladys Daniel, learned counsel on record for sole petitioner, [claimant before AT] was beforethis Court in this web hearing on a video conferencing platform.3. Owing to the grounds raised and canvassed in the hearing, this Court reminds itself that Section34 of A and C Act is neither an appeal nor a revision. It is not even a full-fledged judicial review, it isa mere challenge to an arbitral award and the legal drill of testing an impugned award shouldperambulate within the short statutory perimeter of Section 34 of A and C Act. In this regard, thisCourt reminds itself of Fiza Developers principle https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 being law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade PrivateLimited Vs. AMCI (India) Private Limited reported in (2009) 17 SCC 796, wherein it was held thatSection 34 is a one issue summary procedure. To be noted, Fiza Developers principle wassubsequently reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., v.Girdhar Sondhi reported in (2018) 9 SCC 49 wherein, it was opined that Fiza Developers is a step inthe right direction. Thereafter, both Fiza Developers and Emkay Global were reiterated by Hon'bleSupreme Court in Canara Nidhi Limited case [M/S. Canara Nidhi Limited vs M. Shashikala reportedin 2019 SCC Online SC 1244]. In this regard, Hon'ble Supreme Court made it clear that while sayingone issue, it does not mean that the lis between the adversaries before AT should turn on one issue,but the impugned award being put to challenge in a Section 34 application itself becomes an issuei.e., lone issue before a Section 34 Court.4. Owing to the arguments advanced by placing strong reliance on paragraphs 35, 38 to 40 ofWestern Geco being judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in ONGC Ltd. v. Western GecoInternational Ltd., [(2003) 5 SCC 705], it has become necessary to set out the obtaining legalposition with clarity and specificity. To be noted, learned counsel forhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 petitioner pressed into service, the oft-quotedjudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority.Learned counsel placed reliance on Associate Builders as reported in Manupatra beingMANU/SC/1076/2014. The equivalent of this in SCC is (2015) 3 SCC 49. Be that as it may, asManupatra report was pressed into service, this Court looked at the aforementioned Manupatrareport. Attention of this Court was drawn to paragraphs placing reliance on Western Geco besidessome other paragraphs which would be dealt with infra. Reliance was placed on the followingparagraph of Associate Builders as in Manupatra report:'In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western Geco International Ltd.MANU/SC/0772/2014 : 2014 (9) SCC 263, this Court added three other distinct andfundamental juristic principles which must be understood as a part and parcel of thefundamental policy of Indian law. The Court held-35. What then would constitute the "fundamental policy of Indian law" is thequestion. The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd.MANU/SC/0314/2003 : (2003) 5 SCC 705] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so,Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/2the expression must, in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles asproviding a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country.Without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression"fundamental policy of Indian law", we may refer to three distinct and fundamentaljuristic principles that must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of thefundamental policy of Indian law.The first and foremost is the principle that in everyhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 determination whether by acourt or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civilconsequences, the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is in legalparlance called a "judicial approach" in the matter. The duty to adopt a judicialapproach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the court or theauthority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the foraconcerned. What must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial approachin judicial and quasi- judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as the court,tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights or obligations of theparties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act in anarbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that theauthority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objectivemanner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration.Judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that canrender the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge.38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law is theprinciple that a court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determiningthe rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principlesof natural justice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets ofthe principles of natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter mustapply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one wayor the other. Non application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication.Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure ofmind is best done by recording reasons in support of the decision which the court orauthority is taking. The requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply itsmind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can bedescribed as a fundamental policy of Indian law.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 202139. No less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic fundamental inadministrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person wouldhave arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity or irrationality ofdecisions is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury principle [Associated Provincial Picture HousesLtd. v. Wednesbury Corporation MANU/UKWA/0001/1947 :Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/3(1948) 1 KB 223 : (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA)]of reasonableness. Decisions that fall short of thestandards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of thesuperior courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the same are available.40. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive enumeration of what wouldconstitute the fundamental policy of Indian law nor is it possible to place the expression in thestraitjacket of a definition. What is important in the context of the case at hand is that if on factsproved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to have been drawn or ifthey have drawn an inference which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice,the adjudication even when made by an Arbitral Tribunal that enjoys considerable latitude and playat the joints in making awards will be open to challenge and may be cast away or modifieddepending upon whether the offending part is or is not severable from the rest.'5. The above is paragraph 28 in the SCC report of Associate Builders. It therefore becomes clear thatlearned counsel has placed reliance on paragraphs 35 and 38 to 40 of Western Geco. Theseparagraphs (as extracted and reproduced in Associate Builders), were extensively read to this Court.It was also reiterated more than once and it can therefore be described as 'burden of the song' quapetitioners pivotal submission. This Court makes it https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 clear that with regard to the aforementioned paragraphs in Western Geco, Hon'ble SupremeCourt in a subsequent judgement in Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited Vs.National Highways Authority of India reported in (2019) SCC online 677 equivalent to (2019) 15SCC 131, in paragraphs 36 of SCC Online report had held that Western Geco as understood inAssociate Builders and paragraphs 28 and 29 of Associate Builders has since been done away.Paragraph 36 of Ssangyong as per online report reads as follows:'36.Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, thata domestic award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as understoodin paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders[Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49:(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204], or secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or moralityas understood in paras 36 to 39 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49:(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204]. Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Section48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the Amendment Act only so that Western Geco [ONGC v. Western GecoInternational Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12], as understood in Associate Builders[Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204], and paras 28 and 29 inparticular, is now done away with.' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 20216. Learned counsel also drew the attention of this Court to the successive paragraphs in AssociateBuilders i.e., paragraphs following the aforementioned paragraphs, which are paragraph 29onwards in the SCC report. This will be dealt with as this Court proceeds with the matter.7. Owing to the limited statutory perimeter of Section 34 and the limited legal landscape of Section34 of A and C Act, in the considered view of this Court, short facts shorn of elaboration or in otherwords factual matrix in a nutshell containing essential facts will suffice. Short facts, as can be culledDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/4out from the case file placed before this Court and from the elaborate submissions made by learnedcounsel for petitioner are; that the petitioner is a Member of Division Executive Committee ofSouthern Asia Division, Seventh Day Adventists Church; that this Court is informed that there are asmany as 14 Divisions across the world; that the petitioner has been serving the Executive Committeesince 2015; that the petitioner also served on the Board of Lowry College; that the petitioner is aDentist by profession with over 40 years of practice; that learned counsel emphasised that thepetitioner practices and professes his religion with all sincerity, he adheres to various tenetsincluding what is known as 'Tithe' whereby, a part of a persons https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/O.P.No.38 of 2021 earnings is contributed for common causes; that the core issue in the lis beforeAT is a resolution, which sought to amend the retirement plan policy, namely retirement age of theemployees of South Asia Division including employees of the respondent entity from (a) 60 to 62years (b) 62 to 65 years and (c) 65 to 70 years; that it was contented that Pastor Ezra Lakras oughtnot to have chaired the meeting (in which age increase resolution was passed) as he had interest inthe matter; that the AT entered upon reference having been appointed by an order of this Courtdated 17.10.2019 made in A.Nos.4361 and 5995 of 2019; that this Court is informed that the17.10.2019 order of this Court has been given quietus and neither party has carried it in appeal; thatbefore the AT, documents were marked; that AT, on the basis of pleadings, documents, writtenarguments and submissions, made the impugned award rejecting petitioner's challenge to theresolution passed by the Southern Asia Division at the Mid year Division Executive CommitteeMeeting held on 29.05.2019 at Ranchi; that the petitioner, has now laid challenge to the impugnedaward by way of captioned OP.8. This Court now proceeds to consider the submissions that were made with regard to grounds onwhich challenge to the impugned award was predicated. As already alluded to and delineated supra,learned counsel for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 petitioner, placed strongreliance on paragraphs 35 and 38 to 40 of Western Geco as extracted/reiterated in AssociateBuilders and the same has been dealt with in the earlier part of this order. Be that as it may, learnedcounsel posited her challenge to the impugned award primarily on the ground that it is in conflictwith public policy of India. In other words, to put it in statutory parlance, the primary challenge waspredicated qua Section 34(2)(b)(ii) read with clauses (ii) and (iii) of Explanation 1 of A and C Act.Learned counsel submitted that the impugned award is not just and reasonable and therefore, itcalls for judicial intervention under the aforesaid provision of A and C Act. In support of hercontentions, learned counsel made elaborate submissions, a summation of which is as follows:a) The Agenda i.e., Ex.C5 does not contain the subject matter of impugned resolution.b) Pastor Ezra Lakra ought not to have chaired the Mid year Division ExecutiveCommittee Meeting held on 29.05.2019 as his spouse took the benefit by the increasein the age.c) The resolution ought to have been passed if at all and if that be so by a two-thirdsmajority and not by a simple majority.Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/5d) The resolution effectively is a Working Policy Amendment and therefore, the same could not havebeen done https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 by way of the impugned resolution.e) The vote of the petitioner has not been taken into account for deciding on the resolution and theresolution ultimately came to be passed by a 21:22 simple majority. In other words, it is thesubmission of learned counsel that it was a water thin majority.9. In support of the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to thepleadings before AT more particularly, paragraph 15 thereat with regard to the point that the chairhad an interest. It was pointed out that in the written submissions before AT, this particularargument has been highlighted in paragraph 26 thereat. In this regard, while on the writtensubmissions, it is deemed appropriate and convenient to record that learned counsel also drew theattention of this Court to paragraphs 27 and 28 of written arguments before AT, which turn onanother issue namely the issue as to whether a vote sent through SMS by one who participated inthe proceedings, can be ignored.10. The attention of this Court was also drawn to Exs.C3 and C5 before AT with regard to thesubmission that the subject matter of resolution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 did not form part of Agenda. Ex.C2A was also read to this Court and more particularly,Paragraph 6 thereat to say that the amendment can be only by a two-third's majority.11. Attention of this Court was also drawn to Ex.R2A, which pertains to retirement plan policies ofthe Southern Asia Division and this was to say that 30 days prior notice needs to be given.12. The aforementioned submissions, the buttressing arguments and the documents / materialsbefore AT, to which attention of this Court was drawn turn heavily on evidence. To be noted, therewas no oral evidence before AT. In other words, there was only documentary evidence before AT.The petitioner, who was claimant before AT [described as petitioner by AT] marked Exs.C1 to C18and Ex.C2A. The respondent in captioned OP which was also the respondent before AT markedEx.R1 to R10 and Ex.R2A. In this regard, this Court reminds itself of the Hodgkinson principle beingprinciple laid down by an English Court in Hodgkinson Vs. Fernie reported in 140 ER 712. ThisHodgkinson principle, has been recognized by Indian Courts and interestingly in this very AssociateBuilders case, which has been pressed into service. To put it in simple terms, Hodgkinson principleis to the effect that AT is the best judge of the quality and quantity of evidencehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 before it. Relevant paragraph in AssociateBuilders is paragraph 41 and the same reads as follows:'41. This, in turn, led to the famous principle laid down in Champsey Bhara Co. v.Jivraj Balloo Spg. and Wvg. Co. Ltd. [AIR 1923 PC 66 : (1922-23) 50 IA 324 : 1923 AC480 : 1923 All ER Rep 235 (PC)] , where the Privy Council referred to Hodgkinson[(1857) 3 CB (NS) 189 : 140 ER 712] and then laid down: (IA pp. 330-32) The law onthe subject has never been more clearly stated than by Williams, J. in Hodgkinsonv.Fernie [(1857) 3 CB (NS) 189 : 140 ER 712] : [CB(NS) p. 202 : ER p. 717] The lawhas for many years been settled, and remains so at this day, that, where a cause orDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/6matters in difference are referred to an arbitrator, whether a lawyer or a layman, he isconstituted the sole and final Judge of all questions both of law and of fact. The onlyexceptions to that rule are cases where the award is the result of corruption or fraud,and one other, which, though it is to be regretted, is now, I think firmly establishedviz. where the question of law necessarily arises on the face of the award or uponsome paper accompanying and forming part of the award. Though the propriety ofthis latter may very well be doubted, I think it may be considered as established. ***Now the regret expressed by Williams, J. in Hodgkinson v.Fernie [(1857) 3 CB (NS)189 : 140 ER 712] has been repeated by more than one learned Judge, and it iscertainly not to be desired that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 exception should be in any way extended. An error in law on the face of theaward means, in Their Lordships' view, that you can find in the award or a documentactually incorporated thereto, as for instance, a note appended by the arbitratorstating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of theaward and which you can then say is erroneous. It does not mean that if in a narrativea reference is made to a contention of one party that opens the door to seeing firstwhat that contention is, and then going to the contract on which the parties' rightsdepend to see if that contention is sound. Here it is impossible to say, from what isshown on the face of the award, what mistake the arbitrators made. The only way thatthe learned Judges have arrived at finding what the mistake was is by saying:Inasmuch as the arbitrators awarded so and so, and inasmuch as the letter shows that the buyerrejected the cotton, the arbitrators can only have arrived at that result by totally misinterpretingRule 52. But they were entitled to give their own interpretation to Rule 52 or any other article, andthe award will stand unless, on the face of it they have tied themselves down to some special legalproposition which then, when examined, appears to be unsound. Upon this point, therefore, TheirLordships think that the judgment of Pratt, J. was right and the conclusion of the learned Judges ofthe Court of Appeal [Jivraj Baloo Spg. and Wvg. Co. Ltd. v. Champsey Bhara and Co., ILR (1920) 44Bom 780. The judgment of Pratt, J. may be referred to at ILR p. 787.] erroneous. This judgment hasbeen consistently followed in India to test awards under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940.'https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 202113. As alluded to supra, after drawing the attention of this Court to paragraphs in Associate Builderswherein, paragraphs 35 and 38 to 40 of Western Geco, attention of this Court was also drawn to thesubsequent paragraphs also to say that the impugned award is not just and that it lacks judicialapproach, warranting intervention by this Court in exercise of Section 34 jurisdiction. Strongreliance was placed on these paragraphs which were read to the court and this is the sheet anchorsubmission. In this regard, this Court has to go back to Ssangyong principle, which has beenreferred to supra. This Court also deems it appropriate to record that Western Geco was rendered on04.09.2014, Associate Builders was rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court on 25.11.2014 anamendment to the A and C Act kicked in with retrospective effect on and from 23.10.2015 thereafter.This amendment was vide Act 3 of 2016, which kicked in with retrospective effect on and from23.10.2015. Thereafter, Ssangyong was rendered on 08.05.2019, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court inSsangyong explained the impact of this amendment on the principles laid down in AssociateDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/7Builders. In this regard, as already alluded to supra, Hon'ble Supreme Court held in Ssangyong thatparagraphs 35 and 38 to 40 of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 Western Gecohas been done away with and this is owing to Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii). The relevantparagraph in Ssangyong has also been referred to supra. To be noted Natural Justice Principles(NJP) to be tested on Audi alteram partem which is one of the three juristic doctrines culled out asfacets of Section 34 of A and C Act by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Associate Builders remains. This isparagraph 30 of Associate Builders case and it flows from paragraph 34 from Ssangyong as asequitur that, this juristic doctrine remains. This leaves us with the third juristic doctrine, which iseffectively perversity/irrationality. This was explained in paragraph 41 of Ssangyong principle laiddown by Hon'ble Supreme Court, which has been extracted and reproduced supra.14. Therefore, the perversity ground as set out in Associate Builders is now not available post23.10.2015 and it is now available at best only as a patent illegality ground under sub-section (2-A)of Section 34 of A and C Act. To be noted, patent illegality ground was available prior to 23.10.2015also, but that was by way of a ground added to grounds for challenge to an arbitral award by Oil andNatural Gas Corporation Ltd. Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd., https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 reported in (2003) 5 SCC 705. Relevant paragraph in Saw Pipes is Paragraph 31, which readsas follows:'31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase public policy of India used in Section 34 incontext is required to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept ofpublic policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the publicinterest. What is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious orharmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. However,the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisionscannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely toadversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition tonarrower meaning given to the term public policy in Renusagar case [1994 Supp (1)SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patentlyillegal. The result would be award could be set aside if it is contrary to:(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or(b) the interest of India; or(c) justice or morality, or(d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature itcannot be held that award is against the public policy.Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of thecourt. Such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void.'Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/8https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 202115. Post 23.10.2015, as it is not patent illegality as laid down in Saw Pipes and as it is patent illegalitywithin the meaning of sub section (2-A) of Section 34 of A and C Act, it stands circumscribed by theproviso to Section 34(2-A) of A and C Act, which reads as follows:'34.(1) .....(2) ......(2-A).An Arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than internationalcommercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Courts finds thatthe award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award:Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneousapplication of the law or by re-appreciation of evidence.'16. A careful perusal of the proviso makes it clear that it is a two limbed proviso.While one limb excludes mere erroneous application of law, the other limb forbidsre-appreciation of evidence. It is in this context that this Court has referred toHodgkinson principle, which was recognized by Hon'ble Supreme Court in AssociateBuilders case. To be noted, for the purpose of completeness, this Court has made itclear that in Associate Builders case on which strong reliance was placed by learnedcounsel, three juristic principles were culled out they are:A) Judicial approach;https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021b) Natural justice principle (NJP for brevity); andc) Irrationality/perversity.17. After culling out these three juristic principles i.e., (a) Judicial approach, (b) NJP and (c)irrationality/perversity, Hon'ble Supreme Court also laid down the three tests for the same andthose three tests are a)fidelity of judicial approach ; b) time honoured audi alteram partem andc)celebrated Wednesbury principle of reasonableness [irrationality/perversity] respectively. Hon'bleSupreme Court in Ssangyong case had made it clear that the second doctrine i.e., NJP remains andthe other two stand altered in the manner which has been alluded to supra.18. This takes us to the impugned award.Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/919. As already alluded to supra, both sides have chosen not to let in oral evidence and there was onlydocumentary evidence and the exhibits numbers assigned to the documents have been set out supra.On the rival pleadings, AT framed as many as 9 issues, this is captured and adumbrated inparagraph 4 of the impugned award, which reads as follows:'4. On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues were framed on 21.02.2020.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 1. Whether the Petitioner has locus standi tochallenge the amendment of Working Policy?2. Whether the Petitioner has locus standi to invoke the Arbitration Clause contained in Clause XVIof Articles of Association of the Respondent Company?3. Whether the impugned resolution passed by the Division Executive Committee is an arbitrableissue under the Arbitration Clause of the Respondent Company?4. Whether the provisions of 2000 Constitution of the Southern Asia Division of Seventh DayAdventists can be revoked after the coming into force of the new Constitution of Southern AsiaDivision of the General Conference of Seventh Day Adventists which is in force from 19thNovember, 2017?5. Whether the resolution to amend the Retirement Plan Policy is an amendment of the Constitutionof Bye Laws or Working Policy requiring two-third majority?6.

Whether voting through a message sent as SMS by a member who has participated in aproceeding is contemplated by the procedure governing the voting in mid-year, year-end and aDivision Council Meeting?And9. Whether the deponent of the affidavit on behalf of the Respondent entitled to contest thedispute?'20. The first three issues were taken up together and answered in favour of the petitioner incaptioned OP, who is protagonist of this challenge to the impugned award. With regard to issues 4 to9, the same went against the petitioner. Learned counsel very fairly submitted that the challenge ishttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 owing to issues 4 to 9 going against thepetitioner. A careful perusal of the manner in which the AT has dealt with issues 4 to 9, in the lightDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/10of the aforementioned submissions and case laws that were pressed into service, will be necessaryowing to the nature of submissions made in captioned OP. Issue No.4 turns on whether theprovision of 2000 Constitution can be invoked after the coming into force of the new Constitution,which is in force on and from 19.11.2017. In answering this issue no.4 on the basis of availabledocumentary evidence, AT has looked at the forward note to the amended Working Policy and hasnoticed that it includes policy revision which are to replace and over ride the previous policy. In thisview of the matter, AT has taken the view that provisions of 2018 under the new Constitution,bye-laws and working policies, can alone be invoked. In this regard, this Court is of the view thatthis is not an implausible view. This not being an implausible view, judicial intervention underSection 34 of A and C Act stands eliminated. This Court reminds itself (as alluded to supra) that thisis not an appeal. For a challenge of this nature to be entertained, there should be prima faciedemonstration that this is an implausible view. The next issue is issue no.5. This is the argumentturning on two-third majority versus simple majority. It is the case of the petitioner that it shouldhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 have been carried only by two-thirds majority,it has been carried by simple majority. In this regard, AT has looked at the bye-laws and workingpolicy, clause 6 of Article 10 of 2009 Working Policy [Ex.C2 before AT] and held that itcontemplates a provision of amendment for working policy. This also contemplates requirement oftwo-thirds majority of votes of members for amendment to working policy of any duly called Midyear Division Executive Committee by issuing special notice atleast 30 days prior to the date of themeeting. Thereafter, AT has clearly held that this clause stood amended in the year 2018 andtherefore, the requirement of two-thirds majority is restricted only for amendment to theConstitution or its bye-laws necessarily meaning thereby that the requirement of two-thirdsmajority is not contemplated for a resolution to be passed in Division Executive Committee Meetingwith regard to amendment to working policy. On this basis, AT came to the conclusion that thecontention that the impugned resolution passed by a simple majority of votes without there beingtwo- thirds majority is not acceptable, is not tenable. In the considered opinion of this Court, this isalso not an implausible view. In other words this is not an interpretation which no reasonableperson would take. This Section 34 Court cannot substitute its view in place of view of AT merelybecause this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 Court feels that its view is moreappealing. After all, at the end of the day, this is not an appeal under Section 96 of The Code of CivilProcedure, 1908.21. Issue No.6 before AT deals with mandate of prior circulation of Agenda for the regularlyconvened Mid year Division Executive Meeting for an amendment to retirement policy clause. Whileanswering issue No.6, AT has placed reliance on Ex.C6 and more particularly, page 71 thereat, andhas come to the conclusion that it mentioned meeting adjourned and special sub committee woulddiscuss retirement age. On this basis, AT came to the conclusion that the contention of the petitionerthat the impugned resolution should be set aside as the Agenda was not circulated and the same wastaken for consideration only after number of members left the venue including the petitionerhimself, cannot be accepted. This view, is again not implausible and while on this, it is to be noticedthat learned counsel pointed out that AT has noticed that number of members have left the venue.This is the submission made before AT and there was no oral evidence in this regard. This again, itturns on an exhibit, which is documentary evidence before AT, wherein, Hodgkinson principleapplies to the case on hand. In any event, AT has framed an issue with regard to the vote of theDr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/11petitioner by SMS and has answered the same. That would be dealt with infra.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 202122. This takes us to Issue No.7, which is about beneficiary of a resolution chairing the Meeting. Afterlooking at several exhibits before AT, it come to the conclusion that the doctrine of necessityoperates in this regard. This is articulated paragraphs 21 of the impugned award, which reads asfollows:'21. Nevertheless the question as to whether Pastor Ezras Lakra is precluded fromchairing the Committee which passed the impugned resolution on the ground that hewould be the beneficiary of the resolution. It is seen from Ex.C-6 (Page 71), adiscussion on the retirement age of Southern Asia Division again took place in themeeting chaired by Hidayat Masih in the forenoon of 29.05.2019 itself and thediscussion was adjourned. Ex.R-3 at page 31 again relates to another resolution of thePolicy Revision Committee in the forenoon of 29.05.2019 itself. The above committeewas chaired by M.Wilson and Benny Joseph, Secretary. The meeting resolved torecommend to Division Executive Committee to amend the retirement plan policyZ30 05, 1 as contained in Ex.C-3. In this background only, the meeting that tookplace on the afternoon session of 29.05.2019, chaired by Pastor Ezras Lakra resolvedby impugned resolution only to the extent of accepting the recommendation of thePolice Revision Committee referred to above, to amend the retirement plan policyZ30 05, 1. It is not as if that Pastor Ezras Lakra chaired in all the previous meetings.Moreover, nothing is pleaded that he either persuaded or influencedhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 any of the members either in the PolicyRevision Committee or in the Mid-year Division Committee to vote in favour of the enhancement ofretirement age of the employees. A mere participation or chairing a meeting by a possiblebeneficiary by itself cannot be a ground to set aside the resolution, unless the mala fides areestablished. Hence, the challenge to the impugned resolution on the above ground must fail.Accordingly, this issue is answered.'23. In the considered opinion of this Court, this again, is not an implausible view as on the face of it,doctrine of necessity is something, which turns on evidence before AT and facts and circumstancesof a case. This Court reminds itself that review of an impugned award on merits is not available anymore. Suffice to say that this is not an appeal and this is not a revision either.24. With regard to the vote of the petitioner sent by SMS, the same is covered by issue no.8. Issueno.8 is answered in paragraph 22 of the impugned award and AT has placed reliance in paragraph10 [Ex.C2] and Article XIV of amended provision and came to the conclusion that they speak only ofmembers present and voting at any session and not otherwise. There being no oral evidence andthere being only documentary evidence, this view taken by AT on the basis of available documentaryevidence before it, does not fit into the slot of any implausible view within the contours andhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 confines of A and C Act as it is not aninterpretation which no reasonable person would take.Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/1225. AT has framed an issue with regard to competence of the deponent of the affidavit on behalf ofthe respondent, but no arguments with regard to that aspect of the matter was advanced before thisCourt and therefore, it is not necessary to examine the same. Suffice to say that a perusal of thisanswer to issue no.9 also does not impress this Court that it warrants any intervention as the same iswell founded.26. Before concluding, this Court, owing to the grounds that were urged, deems it appropriate toreiterate that Section 34 is neither an appeal nor a revision as mentioned supra. In other words, it isa mere challenge to an arbitral award, within the limited statutory perimeter of Section 34 of A andC Act, which has also been mentioned supra. This Court, while parting with the matter, would addthat Section 34 is a delicate legal balance between sanctus finality of arbitral award ingrained inSection 35 of A and C Act and minimum judicial intervention principle ingrained in Section 5 of Aand C Act on one side and the sacrosanct judicial review, forming part of substantive due process oflaw on the other side. This delicate balance is what makes Section 34 a legal phenomenon, whereinan impugned award https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of 2021 cannot be examinedthrough the traditional and classical prism of an Appellate Court. This is not an Appellate Court andthis is a Section 34 Court and the difference is akin to cheese and chalk or apples and oranges.27. The narrative, discussion and dispositive reasoning, set out supra, draws the curtains on thecampaign of the petitioner qua impugned award as protagonist of captioned OP. This means thatcaptioned OP is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.27.01.2021 Speaking order: Yes Index: Yes kmi https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.38 of2021 M.SUNDAR.J., kmi O.P.No.38 of 2021 27.01.2021 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/Dr.Jacob Groves Daniel vs Service Association Of on 27 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184471814/13
