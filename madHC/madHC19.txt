Read this in conjunction with and in continuation of earlier proceedings dated23.09.2020.3. Today, learned counsel for contesting first respondent requests for further time.4. Learned counsel for petitioners, draws the attention of this Court to paragraph No.2 of theimpugned award, points out that according to impugned award first notice sent by 'ArbitralTribunal' ['AT' for the sake of convenience and clarity] is dated 06.04.2010 fixing 11.05.2010 as thefirst sitting of AT. Learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 counsel forpetitioners drew the attention of this Court to a communication dated 19.05.2010 (post 06.04.2010)sent by first respondent to first petitioner wherein first respondent has mentioned that they wouldbe initiating arbitration proceedings. Pointing this out, learned counsel for petitioners submits thatsole arbitrator who constituted AT obviously could not have been appointed on 06.04.2010 andthere was no prior notice of appointment of arbitrator to petitioners.5. Be that as it may, another aspect of the matter is that the impugned award has been made by asole arbitrator by conducting arbitration proceedings in Mumbai. To be noted, sole arbitrator is aChartered Accountant. The impugned award refers to an 'agreement dated 10.09.2008 bearingAgreement/Account No.108859' [hereinafter 'said agreement' for the sake of convenience andclarity] which is between two petitioners and contesting first respondent.6. It is now become necessary to look at the arbitration clause in the said agreement which serves asan arbitration agreement between parties within the meaning of Section 2(1)(b) read with Section 7of A and C Act.7. Unfortunately, both sides have not placed said agreement before this Court. It has becomenecessary to look at the said agreement to ascertain seat/venue as arbitration has been conducted inMumbai. To be noted, this is relevant for territorial jurisdiction qua captioned OP. Learned counselfor contesting first respondent submits that said agreement has been filed as part of executionproceedings i.e., E.P.No.229 of 2012 which have been lodged in Chennai on the basis of impugnedaward. 8. This Court is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 informed thatexecution petition i.e., E.P.No.229 of 2012 is on the file of IX Assistant Judge, City Civil Court,Chennai. Therefore, Registry is directed to call for records of said E.P.No.229 of 2012 on the file ofIX Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai and place the same along with case file in the nextSivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/2listing. Notwithstanding this position, learned counsel for first respondent shall also produce aphotocopy of said agreement in the next listing after sharing an advance copy with learned counselfor petitioners.9.

In and by earlier proceedings, this Court had directed the Registry to call for records i.e., theentire case file of E.P.No.229 of 2012 on the file of IX Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai. Tobe noted, this is to ascertain jurisdiction as it was submitted that agreement (containing arbitrationclause) has been filed along with the Execution petition. Registry has today put up a note sayingnotice has been served, but records are awaited. IX Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai iswithin this Court campus and the proximity is such that a loud shout from here can be heard there.Therefore, it is surprising that the case file sought for on 22.12.2020 by this Court is still awaited.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 20144. Registry to send a Special Messenger forthwith who will amble across to the IX Assistant Judge'sCourt and collect the case file. Registry to place the aforementioned Execution Court file before meon Monday (11.01.2021) positively (after following SOP in this regard). To be noted, SOP denotesStandard Operating Procedure.5. Be that as it may, both sides submit that they are unable to produce a copy of the said agreementwhich contains the arbitration clause.List on Monday i.e., 11.01.2021.'3. Pursuant to earlier proceedings made in previous listing on 07.01.2021, Registry has put up theentire records/case file qua E.P.No.229 of 2012 on the file of the IX Assistant Judge's Court, CityCivil Court, Chennai. From the aforementioned proceedings, more particularly paragraph 5 ofproceedings dated 22.12.2020, it becomes clear that territorial jurisdiction issue arises in thismatter. Therefore, it is necessary that this territorial jurisdiction issue is to be tested first (withoutgoing into the merits of the matter) as it goes to the root of the captioned OP.4. This Court now embarks upon the exercise of examining the territorial jurisdiction of this Courtqua captioned OP.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014Sivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/35. On a careful perusal of the records of the case file in the aforementioned execution petition, itcomes to light that the agreement between the parties, more particularly the agreement whichcontains the clause which serves as an arbitration agreement within the meaning of Section 2(1)(b)read with Section 7 of A and C Act has not been filed in the Execution Court.6. Today, Mr.S.Saravanan, learned counsel on record for two petitioners and Mr.Anand Johnson,learned counsel representing the counsel on record for contesting first respondent are before me inthis web-hearing on a videoconferencing platform. Today also both the learned counsel reiteratethat they are unable to produce a copy of the contract / agreement containing the clause, whichserves as arbitration agreement between the parties. Therefore, the question as to whetherseat/venue, one of the two or both has/have been specified in the arbitration agreement is aquestion which remains unanswered. This takes us to the venue where arbitral proceedings wereheld and impugned award was made.7. A perusal of the impugned award makes it clear that arbitral proceedings have been held entirelyand impugned award has been made in Mumbai. In this regard, it is to be noted that impugnedaward has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 been executed in non-judicialstamp paper issued in the State of Maharashtra and a scanned reproduction of the same is asfollows:https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 20148. To be noted, the above also gives the address of the sole arbitrator who constituted the AT andthis is also in Mumbai. This is of relevance as paragraph 2 of impugned award says that the solearbitrator directed the parties to appear before him at his office on 11.05.2010.Therefore, going by the impugned award it is clear that the arbitral proceedings have been held inthe office of the sole Arbitrator in Mumbai and the impugned award has been made in Mumbai,State of Maharashtra.9. This takes us to BGS SGS Soma principle being principle laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court inBGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC Ltd.reported in (2020) 4 SCC 234. In this case, paragraph 33 of BGS SGS Soma assumes significanceand for the purpose of putting this matter in perspective, paragraph 33 of BGS SGS Soma case lawcan be profitably reproduced and the same reads as follows:'33. Some of the early decisions of this Court did not properly distinguish betweenseat and venue of an arbitral proceeding. The five-Judge Bench in BALCO [BALCO v.Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ)810] dealt with this problem as follows : (SCC pp. 597-99, 605-607, paras 75-76, 95-96, 98-99) 75. We are also unable to accept the submission of thelearned counsel for the appellants that the Arbitration Act, 1996 does notSivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/4https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 make seat of the arbitration as the centre ofgravity of the arbitration. On the contrary, it is accepted by most of the experts that in most of thenational laws, arbitrations are anchored to the seat/place/situs of arbitration. Redfern in Para 3.54concludes that the seat of the arbitration is thus intended to be its centre of gravity. [ Blackaby,Partasides, Redfern and Hunter (Eds.), Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration (5th Edn.,Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2009)] This, however, does not mean that all theproceedings of the arbitration have to take place at the seat of the arbitration. The arbitrators attimes hold meetings at more convenient locations. This is necessary as arbitrators often come fromdifferent countries. It may, therefore, on occasions be convenient to hold some of the meetings in alocation which may be convenient to all. Such a situation was examined by the Court of Appeal inEngland in Naviera Amazonica Peruana SA v. Compania International de Seguros del Peru [NavieraAmazonica Peruana SA v. Compania International de Seguros del Peru, (1988) 1 Lloyd's Rep 116(CA)] wherein at p. 121 it is observed as follows:The preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one place of arbitration. This willbe the place chosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will be designated in the arbitrationagreement or the terms of reference or the minutes of proceedings or in some other way as the placeor seat of the arbitration. This does not mean, however, that the Arbitral Tribunal must hold all itsmeetings or hearings at the place of arbitration. International commercial arbitration often involvespeople of many different nationalities, from many different countries. In these circumstances,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 it is by no means unusual for an ArbitralTribunal to hold meetings or even hearings in a place other than the designated place of arbitration,either for its own convenience or for the convenience of the parties or their witnesses. It may bemore convenient for an Arbitral Tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in anothercountry for instance, for the purpose of taking evidence. In such circumstances each move of theArbitral Tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of arbitration changes. The seat of arbitrationremains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties. These observations weresubsequently followed in Union of India v. McDonnell Douglas Corpn. [Union of India v. McDonnellDouglas Corpn., (1993) 2 Lloyd's Rep 48]76. It must be pointed out that the law of the seat or place where the arbitration is held, is normallythe law to govern that arbitration. The territorial link between the place of arbitration and the lawgoverning that arbitration is well established in the international instruments, namely, the NewYork Convention of 1958 and the UNCITRAL Model Law of 1985. It is true that the terms seat andplace are often used interchangeably. In Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration [Blackaby, Partasides, Redfern and Hunter (Eds.), Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration(5th Edn., Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2009)] (Para 3.51), the seat theory is definedthus:The concept that an arbitration is governed by the law of the place in which it is held, which isthe seat (or forum or locus arbitri) of the arbitration, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549of 2014 is well established in both the theory and practice of international arbitration. In fact, theGeneva Protocol, 1923 states: 2. The arbitral procedure, including the constitution of the ArbitralTribunal, shall be governed by the will of the parties and by the law of the country in whose territorythe arbitration takes place. The New York Convention maintains the reference to the law of thecountry where the arbitration took place [Article V(1)(d)] and, synonymously to the law of theSivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/5country where the award is made [Articles V(1)(a) and (e)]. The aforesaid observations clearly showthat the New York Convention continues the clear territorial link between the place of arbitrationand the law governing that arbitration. The author further points out that this territorial link isagain maintained in the Model Law which provides in Article 1(2) that:1. (2) the provision of this Law, except Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36, apply only if the place of arbitrationis in the territory of the State. Just as the Arbitration Act, 1996 maintains the territorial link betweenthe place of arbitration and its law of arbitration, the law in Switzerland and England also maintaina clear link between the seat of arbitration and the lex arbitri. The Swiss Law states:176(I). (1) The provision of this chapter shall apply to any arbitration if the seat of the ArbitralTribunal is in Switzerland and if, at the time when the arbitration agreement was concluded, at leastone of the parties had neither its domicile nor its habitual residence in Switzerland. [See the SwissPrivate International Law Act, 1987, Ch. 12, Article 176 (I)(1).] ***https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 201495. The learned counsel for the appellants have submitted that Section 2(1)(e), Section 20 andSection 28 read with Section 45 and Section 48(1)(e) make it clear that Part I is not limited only toarbitrations which take place in India. These provisions indicate that the Arbitration Act, 1996 issubject-matter centric and not exclusively seat-centric. Therefore, seat is not the centre of gravity sofar as the Arbitration Act, 1996 is concerned. We are of the considered opinion that the aforesaidprovisions have to be interpreted by keeping the principle of territoriality at the forefront. We haveearlier observed that Section 2(2) does not make Part I applicable to arbitrations seated or heldoutside India. In view of the expression used in Section 2(2), the maxim expressum facit cessaretacitum, would not permit by interpretation to hold that Part I would also apply to arbitrations heldoutside the territory of India. The expression this Part shall apply where the place of arbitration is inIndia necessarily excludes application of Part I to arbitration seated or held outside India. It appearsto us that neither of the provisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants would makeany section of Part I applicable to arbitration seated outside India. It will be apposite now toconsider each of the aforesaid provisions in turn.96. Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 reads as under: 2. Definitions.(1) In this Part, unlessthe context otherwise requires.(e) Court means the Principal civil court of Original Jurisdiction in a district, and includes the HighCourt in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questionsforming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/O.P.No.549 of 2014 had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of agrade inferior to such Principal civil court, or any Court of Small Causes. We are of the opinion, theterm subject-matter of the arbitration cannot be confused with subject-matter of the suit. The termsubject-matter in Section 2(1)(e) is confined to Part I. It has a reference and connection with theprocess of dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control overthe arbitration proceedings. Hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seatof the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in Section 2(1)(e) has to be construedSivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/6keeping in view the provisions in Section 20 which give recognition to party autonomy. Acceptingthe narrow construction as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, renderSection 20 nugatory. In our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courtsi.e. the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the courts wherethe arbitration takes place. This was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide fora seat of arbitration at a place which would be neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courtswhere the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitralprocess. For example, if the arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi,(Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from Mumbai and the other fromKolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order Under Section 17 of theArbitration Act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order under Section 37 must lie to thecourts of Delhi being the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 courts havingsupervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This would beirrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performedeither at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such circumstances,both the courts would have jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose jurisdiction the subject- matter ofthe suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution i.e.arbitration is located.***98. We now come to Section 20, which is as under: 20. Place of arbitration.(1) The parties are free toagree on the place of arbitration.(2) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1), the place of arbitration shall be determinedby the Arbitral Tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience ofthe parties.(3) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the Arbitral Tribunal may, unless otherwiseagreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among itsmembers, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, good orother property. A plain reading of Section 20 leaves no room for doubt that where the place ofarbitration is in India, the parties are free to agree to any place or seat within India, be it Delhi,Mumbai, etc. In the absence of the parties' agreement thereto, Section 20(2) authorises the tribunalto determine the place/seat of such arbitration. Section 20(3) enables the tribunal to meet at anyplace for conducting https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 hearings at a place ofconvenience in matters such as consultations among its members for hearing witnesses, experts orthe parties.99. The fixation of the most convenient venue is taken care of by Section 20(3). Section 20, has to beread in the context of Section 2(2), which places a threshold limitation on the applicability of Part I,where the place of arbitration is in India. Therefore, Section 20 would also not support thesubmission of the extra-territorial applicability of Part I, as canvassed by the learned counsel for theappellants, so far as purely domestic arbitration is concerned. (emphasis in original and supplied)Sivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/710. Paragraph 45 of BGS SGS Soma can also be profitably reproduced and the same reads as follows:'45. It was not until this Court's judgment in Indus Mobile Distribution (P) Ltd.[Indus Mobile Distribution (P) Ltd. v. Datawind Innovations (P) Ltd., (2017) 7 SCC678 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 760] that the provisions of Section 20 were properlyanalysed in the light of the 246th Report of the Law Commission of India titled,Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (August, 2014)(hereinafter referred to as the Law Commission Report, 2014), under which Sections20(1) and (2) would refer to the seat of the arbitration, and Section 20(3) would referonly to the venue of the arbitration. Given the fact that when parties, either byagreement or, in default of there being an agreement, where the Arbitral Tribunaldetermines a particular place as the seat of the arbitration under Section 31(4) of theArbitration Act, 1996, it becomes clear that the partieshttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 having chosen the seat, or theArbitral Tribunal having determined the seat, have also chosen the courts at the seatfor the purpose of interim orders and challenges to the award. '11. Suffice to say that a combined reading of Indus Mobile case [Indus MobileDistribution Private Limited Vs. Datawind Innovations Private Limited and othersreported in (2017) 7 SCC 678], referred to supra in Paragraph 45 of BGS SGS Somaand Brahmani River Pellets case [Brahmani River Pellets Limited Vs. KamachiIndustries Limited reported in (2020) 5 SCC 462] and BGS SGS Soma principles areon the same lines and this Court refrains itself from burdening this order withextracts from all those case laws. Suffice to say that these case laws and ratiodecidendi thereat make it clear that in the case on hand, contextually speaking venuebecomes the seat and that determines exclusive jurisdiction (inter-alia) for captionedOP and that exclusive jurisdiction is Mumbai, State of Maharashtra.12. Faced with the above situation, learned counsel for petitioner submitted that it is his specificcase that the entire arbitral proceedings are sham, according to him no proceedings were held andlearned counsel drew my attention to second part of Ground (F) and Ground (H) in captioned OP,which read as follows:https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 'F.......In this present case no claimstatement, document, exhibit and other informations based on which the arbitral tribunal made theaward, are not communicated to the petitioners. Even in the award it is not mentioned that based onwhich documents the award is passed. No exhibits were mentioned in the award. Mere reading theaward will show that it was passed with the collusion of the respondents and not in accordance withlaw. It is clear case of fraud committed by the respondents.'H. The first respondent mere participated in a fake proceedings conducted by the secondrespondent, who is loyal to them, which is illegal. On this sole ground the arbitration award is liableto be set aside. Even the copy of the fake award was not delivered to the petitioners. Section 31(5) ofthe arbitration and conciliation act 1996 states as follows:Sivasakthi.R vs Tata Motors Limited on 11 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153289003/8After the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each party. Hence the actmandates the sole arbitrator/Arbitration tribunal to deliver the award to each party concerned. Inthis present case no such award was delivered to the petitioners.'13. This Court is clear that on a demurrer even if the submission of learned counsel is accepted, theimpugned award has been made in Mumbai and the impugned award says that the arbitralproceedings were held in the office of the sole Arbitrator in Mumbai. This is in the light of theexclusive jurisdiction principle, this question of whether arbitral proceedings were actually held orwhether there was a fraud as alleged https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 shouldalso be decided only by the jurisdictional Court and not by this Court. This again is in the light ofexclusive jurisdiction principle i.e., BGS SGS Soma principle.14. The sequitur of the narrative, discussion and dispositive reasoning thus far is, captioned OPdeserves to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction.Though obvious, it is made clear that this Court examined and set out only the bare minimumaspects of the matter necessary for examining jurisdiction and has not expressed any opinion on themerits of the matter. To state with specificity, this Court makes it clear that it has not examined anypoint on merits and expressed any view on the same (except territorial jurisdiction point) as thisCourt is coming to the conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction in the light of BGS SGS Soma principle.Therefore, if the petitioner who is the protagonist of captioned OP chooses to approach thejurisdictional Court, it is made clear that this order will not come in the way and all questionsincluding questions raised in the captioned OP are left open.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.549 of 2014 Captioned OP is rejected on the ground oflack of jurisdiction for this Court.
