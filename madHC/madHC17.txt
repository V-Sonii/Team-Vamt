For petitioner             :         Mr.B.Ravi Raja                            For respondent             :         Mr.M.Murali Adikesavan                 1/19https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/                                                       ORDERCaptioned 'Original Petition' [hereinafter 'OP' for the sake of brevity] is an application under Section34 of 'The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act No.26 of 1996)' which shall hereinafter bereferred to as 'A and C Act' for the sake of brevity, convenience and clarity. Captioned OP has beenfiled assailing an 'arbitral award dated 12.12.2017' [hereinafter 'impugned award' for the sake ofS.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/1brevity, convenience and clarity] made by a 'Arbitral Tribunal' ['AT' for the sake of brevity,convenience and clarity] constituted by a sole arbitrator.2. Owing to the short statutory perimeter of Section 34 of A and C Act or in other words owing to thelimited legal landscape within which a legal drill of testing an arbitral award under Section 34 of Aand C Act should perambulate, short facts shorn of elaboration will suffice. To put it differently,factual matrix in a nutshell containing essential facts imperative for appreciating this order willsuffice.3. 'Flat No.106, ETA, Jasmine Court, First Floor, C Block, Kattupakkam, Chennai-600 056measuring an extent of 1402 sq.feet' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021[hereinafter 'demised Flat' for the sake of convenience and clarity] and a lease deed dated05.03.2010 between the parties to the captioned OP constitute the nucleus of lis between the partiesbefore AT. If this demised Flat and lease deed constitute the nucleus of captioned OP, disputes thaterupted between parties in captioned OP pertaining to lease of this demised Flat can be described asepicenter of lis before AT. To be noted, lone respondent before me in captioned OP is the owner ofdemised Flat and is the lessor and sole petitioner in captioned OP is lessee qua demised Flat.4. Short facts are that lease of demised Flat was originally in and by a lease deed dated 05.03.2010;that lease was terminated, but termination was revisited by parties and lease stood extended; thatlease was extended from time to time and there was also increase in monthly rent; that monthly rentwas originally Rs.15,000/- and it stood as Rs.22,000/- per month at the time of eruption ofdisputes; that from hereon 'petitioner' in captioned OP shall be referred to as 'lessee' and'respondent' in captioned OP shall be referred to as 'lessor'; that at the time of inception of lease,lessee had paid a refundable advance and had also agreed to pay maintenance charges; thatdispute/lis essentially centers around alleged non-payment of monthly rent by lesseehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 from June of 2011; that there was nodisputation or disagreement that there is an arbitration clause in the lease deed dated 05.03.2010and this arbitration clause serves as arbitration agreement between lessor and lessee beingarbitration agreement within the meaning of Section 2(1)(b) read with Section 7 of A and C Act; thatlessor filed O.P.No.766 of 2012 in this Hon'ble Court under Section 11 of A and C Act and thisHon'ble Court appointed a sole arbitrator in and by an order dated 06.03.2015; that the solearbitrator, who constituted AT entered upon reference adjudicated upon lis between lessor, lesseeand made the impugned award; that assailing the impugned award, captioned OP has been filed.5. This Court having set out the factual matrix in a nutshell which also captures the trajectory thismatter has taken in reaching this Court vide captioned OP, now proceeds to deal with submissionsadvanced by Mr.B.Ravi Raja, learned counsel for lessee, who is petitioner before me.6. Learned counsel for petitioner made submissions assailing the impugned award, a summation ofwhich is as follows:(a) There was an oral agreement between lessor and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of2021 lessee for the lessee to purchase the demised Flat, but this aspect has not been considered inS.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/2the impugned award.(b) Lessor lives abroad and signatures in arbitral proceedings appear to be forged.(c) A signed copy of impugned award has not been delivered to the lessee.7. Before this Court proceeds to deal with aforementioned submissions, it is necessary to recordsome peripheral but important facts/aspects of this matter.8. Learned counsel for petitioner very fairly submitted that the erstwhile 'Tamil Nadu Buildings(Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960 (Tamil Nadu Act XVIII of 1960)' [hereinafter 'Rent Control Act'for the sake of convenience and brevity] was not applicable to the case on hand. To be noted, thisCourt is informed that this erstwhile statute has now been replaced by a new statute on and from22.02.2019. Be that as it may, learned counsel also went on to submit that Vidya Drolia case inVidya Drolia & Ors. Vs.Durga Trading Corporation reported in 2019 SCConline SC 358,https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 which was referred to a larger Bench has sincebeen decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court vide an order dated 14.12.2020. Therefore, learned counselsubmits that as erstwhile special statute did not apply to the demised Flat even on the date on whichcause of action arose arbitrability issue (though raised before AT) now stands doused.9. Be that as it may, with regard to Vidya Drolia larger Bench order, the same was referred to by acoordinate Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in a subsequent case being Suresh Shah Vs. HipadTechnology India Private Limited, reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 1038. The most relevantparagraph in Vidya Drolia regarding above arbitrability issue that arises in the case on hand, isParagraph No.18, which reads as follows:'18. In the backdrop of the above discussion, we are of the considered view thatinsofar as eviction or tenancy relating to matters governed by special statutes wherethe tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction whereunder the Court/Forumis specified and conferred jurisdiction under the statute alone can adjudicate suchmatters. Hence in such cases the dispute is non-arbitrable. If the special statutes do not apply to the premises/property and the lease/tenancycreated thereunder as on the date when the cause of action arises to seek for eviction or such otherrelief and in such transaction if the parties are governed by an Arbitration Clause; the disputebetween the parties is arbitrable and there shall be no impediment whatsoever to invoke theArbitration Clause. This view is fortified by the opinion expressed by the Co-ordinate Bench whileanswering the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 reference made in the case ofVidya Drolia wherein the view taken in Himangni Enterprises is overruled.'10. Aforementioned Paragraph No.18 of Suresh Shah case rendered by another coordinate Bench ofHon'ble Supreme Court i.e., three member Hon'ble Bench of Supreme Court, has very succinctly setout the answer to reference qua Vidya Drolia case, which is relevant to the case on hand. Therefore,Paragraph No.18 of Suresh Shah case has been profitably extracted and reproduced supra. In thisS.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/3regard, this Court is also informed that the lessor had erroneously filed a Rent Control OP undererstwhile Rent Contral Act in District Munsif Court, Poonamallee, the same was returned and it wasnot pursued. To be noted, returned Rent Control OP under erstwhile Rent Contraol Act has beenmarked as Ex.C8 before AT.11. This Court also deems it appropriate to extract procedural history, issues framed by AT andoperative portion of impugned award.12. 8 issues framed by AT are set out in Paragraph No.29 of impugned award and the same reads asfollows:https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 '1. Whether the respondent is a tenant underthe Claimant?2. Whether the respondent has wilfully failed to pay the rent from June 2011 to June 2015?3. Whether the respondent has committed wilful default in payment of the rent?4. Whether the schedule property lies under Kattupakkam Panchayat?5. Whether the arbitration proceedings will lie in respect of the schedule property located underKattupakkam Panchayat?6. Whether the respondent has paid the rent from June 2015 till date as per the order dated03.11.2015 passed by the Arbitrator in Section 17 application filed by the claimant?7. Whether the respondent is liable to bear the costs?8. To what reliefs the claimant is entitled to?'13. Procedural history of arbitral proceedings are captured in Paragraph Nos.17, 19, 20, 22 to 28 ofimpugned award and the same read as follows:'17. The claimant on 24.08.2015 filed an objection dated 20.08.2015 to thememorandum dated 20.08.2015 filed by the respondent contending as follows:a. The suit schedule property is located at Kattupakkam Village and the same iscoming under the Panchayat Union.b. Rent Control proceedings cannot be invoked for areas which are not notified the Government ofTamil Nadu and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 Kattupakkam Village is not anotified area.S.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/4c. Under Section 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, an application has not been filed forquestioning the jurisdiction of the arbitration proceedings.19. The respondent thereafter filed a reply dated 14.09.2015 stating that the return by the DistrictMunsif Court is only in respect of that particular Court. The very appointment of the Arbitrator isagainst the letter and spirit of the rental agreement and the Arbitrator is estopped to proceed furtheralong with the claimant's request.20. The claimant filed a reply dated 29.09.2015 reiterating that the suit schedule property does notfall within the notified area and the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act will notapply in respect of the suit schedule property. The claimant has also enclosed the tax receipt for thepetition premises which has been issued by Kattupakkam Panchayat (Ex.C9).22. Thereafter the claimant filed a rejoinder dated 12.02.2016 stating that the respondent filed a suitin O.S.No.3 of 2012 before the Principal District Munsif Court, Poonamallee and the same waspending. During the pendency of the above suit, the respondent could not have paid the rent in cashand without taking the rental receipt. The claimant further stated that the respondent had admittedthat she had done modification to the flooring of the balcony and kitchen and the onus is on therespondent to show that the respondent had taken the prior permission of the claimant beforecarrying out the modification. The claimant further stated the respondent had paid the monthly rentfrom March 2010 till May https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 2011 by cheque andafter the order dated 3.11.2015 passed by the Arbitrator, the respondent paid the rent from August2015 till November 2015 by cheque. Hence the claimant contended that the respondent never paidthe rent by cash. The claimant further contended that the respondent in his counter statement didnot oppose the relief sought by the claimant in the claim statement and the respondent only soughtnot to disturb with her possession of the subject property without following the due process of lawand sought for a direction under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Building (Lease and RentControl) Act, 1960. The claimant prayed to allow the claim statement filed by the claimant.23. The claimant filed a proof affidavit dated 17.03.2016 and the following documents were markedas Exhibits C1 to C7 which are as follows C1) Rental Agreement dated 05.03.2010, C2) RenewalRental Agreement dated March, 2011, C3) Legal Notice sent to respondent, C4) Return Cover, C5)Bank Statement from 01.03.2010 to 28.01.2012, C6) Decree and Judgment passed by the Hon'bleDistrict Munsif in O.S.No.3 of 2012 dated 13.01.2015, C7) Bank Statement from 02.12.2015 to11.03.2016.24. The case was posted on 17.03.2016 for cross examination of the claimant witness and on therequest of the counsel of the respondent, the cross examination of the claimant witness was postedon 19.03.2016. On 19.03.2016, the counsel for the respondent cross examined the claimant witness.25. On 19.03.2016, the counsel for the claimant filed a memo dated 19.03.2016 stating that by orderdated 03.11.2015, the Arbitrator directed the respondent to remit the arrears of monthlyhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 rent from June, 2015 till October, 2015amounting to Rs.1,10,000 within a period of 4 weeks from today to the bank account of theS.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/5claimant. The respondent was further directed to remit the monthly rent from November, 2015 onor before of 10th of every month to the bank account of the claimant and the respondent wasdirected to file a proof of the above payment before the Arbitrator within a period of 4 weeks fromthe date of receipt of this order and thereafter periodically. However the respondent has paid therents only for three months and the respondent has not paid the rents for two months. Further therespondent has not paid the rents from November, 2015. The claimant prayed for a direction to therespondent to comply with the order dated 03.11.2015 passed by the Arbitrator.26. The respondent filed an objection dated 28.03.2016 to the memo filed by the claimant statingthat due to heavy rain and floods, the earning capacity of the respondent has been affected and dueto the same, the respondent could not remit the rents for the months of June, 2015 and July, 2015.The respondent further stated that the claimant has not remitted the maintenance charges to theApartment Owners Association and due to the same, the water supply to the subject property wasdisconnected. Hence, the respondent contended that the respondent will pay the rents for June andJuly, 2015 and the future rents only after the claimant pay the maintenance charges to theApartment Owners Association.27. The respondent filed a Sur Rejoinder dated 28.03.2016 stating that the District Munsif Courtdismissed O.S.No.3 of 2012 in view of the claimant and the respondent agreeing to refer thehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 disputes for arbitration. The respondentfurther stated that the claimant has not remitted the maintenance charges to the Apartment OwnersAssociation and due to the same, the water supply to the subject property was disconnected. Hencethe respondent contended that the respondent will pay the rents for June and July, 2015 and thefuture rents only after the claimant pays the maintenance charges to the Apartment OwnersAssociation. The respondent prayed that the claimant should be restrained from disturbing therespondent's peaceful possession of the subject property, direct the claimant to remit themaintenance charges to the Apartment Owners Association and render supply of basic amenities tothe subject property.28. The respondent also filed a proof affidavit dated 28.03.2016 and submitted the followingdocuments in support of her case:-1. 07.04.2012- Status report by ICICI Bank upto 07.04.2002 of the claimant account statement.2. 14.09.2015 - My letter dated 14.09.2015 enclosed Karnataka bank cheque 014352, dated14.09.2015.3. 11.12.2015 - ICICI Bank three chalan dated 11.12.2015.4. Karnataka Bank, Account Statement of mine from 28.07.2015 to 21.12.2015.'14. Operative portion of the impugned award is articulated in Paragraph No.56 of impugned awardand the same reads as follows: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 'Accordingly,an Award is passed:S.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/6I. Directing the respondent to pay the claimant, a sum of Rs.16,30,000/- inclusive of rent tillDecember 2017 (Rupees Sixteen Lakhs Thirty Thousand Only) within two months from the date ofthe Award.II. Directing the respondent to pay the claimant, the sum of Rs.2,92,000/- towards costs.III. Directing the respondent will pay interest to the claimant @ 9% after two months from the dateof the award till the date of the payment on the gross amount of Rs.19,22,000/- (Rupees NineteenLakhs Twenty Two Thousand Only), being the total of (I) and (II) above and if the respondent failsto make the payment within two months from the date of the award then she will be liable to payinterest from the date of the award itself.IV. Directing the respondent to pay a sum of Rs.22,000/- to the claimant payable every monthtowards monthly rent for use of the subject property with effect from January 2018 failing which theclaimant can initiate appropriate proceeding for eviction of the respondent from the subjectproperty.'15. Procedural history (extracted and reproduced supra) remains undisputed and that leaves thisCourt with the considered view that adequate opportunity has been given to lessee and in any eventthere is no serious issue that has been urged in this regard.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 202116. This Court now proceeds to consider submissions made by learned counsel, summation of whichhas been set out supra.17. With regard to oral agreement to purchase demised flat, there is nothing to demonstrate that thiswas one of the issues which was submitted to arbitration. Absent any material to demonstrate thatthis was submitted to arbitration, in the considered view of this Court this argument does not aidlessee, who is protagonist in captioned OP. With regard to signatures appearing to be forged inarbitral proceedings, that is exclusively in the domain of evidence before AT, AT has entertainedproof affidavit filed by lessor/claimant and therefore, this Court does not intend to enter into thatarena which calls for re-appreciation of evidence. This Court also reminds itself that Section 34 of Aand C Act is a summary procedure. To be noted, in Fiza Developers case, in Fiza Developers andInter-Trade Private Limited Vs. AMCI (India) Private Limited reported in (2009) 17 SCC 796,Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that Section 34 legal drill is a one issue summary procedure. Alsoto be noted, Fiza Developers case was reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court subsequently in EmkayGlobal case [Emkay Global https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 Financial ServicesLtd. v. Girdhar Sondhi reported in (2018) 9 SCC 49] as a step in the right direction. Thereafter, FizaDevelopers case and Emkay Global principle were further reiterated in Canara Nidhi Limited case[M/S. Canara Nidhi Limited vs M. Shashikala reported in 2019 SCC Online SC 1244]. Hon'bleSupreme Court has also elucidatively explained that 'one issue summary procedure' does not meanthat the lis itself should turn on one issue but the arbitral award being put to challenge in a Section34 application by itself becomes the issue. This Section 34 being a one issue summary procedureS.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/7viewed in the light of faint submission that has been made regarding forged signatures, this Courtconsiders this to be a ground which is not adequate enough to aid petitioner in her endeavour todislodge the impugned award in the facts and circumstances of the case on hand.18. This takes us to the point regarding signed copy of the impugned award not being delivered tolessee. A perusal of the case file placed before me reveals that predecessor Hon'ble Judge at thepre-numbering stage of captioned OP i.e., OP Diary No.125272 of 2019, had examined this aspect ofthe matter (by requisitioning records of AT) for the purpose of testing whether captioned OP hasbeen filed within time. Predecessor Hon'ble Judge https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of2021 had summoned records of AT and had noticed that the original impugned award was notserved on petitioner lessee, instead it had been lodged in the Madras High Court Arbitration Centre.19. At this juncture, Mr.Murali Adikesavan, learned counsel, who joined the hearing and whosubmitted that he had instructions to represent lessor, (if this Court is inclined to issue notice)requested audience for his say on this aspect of the matter. Learned counsel pointed out that thelessee evaded receipt of the impugned award and therefore, AT had to inevitably lodge the originalaward in the Madras High Court Arbitration centre. Responding to this, learned counsel forpetitioner drew the attention of this Court to a communication dated 23.11.2018 (inter-aliarequesting for impugned award) which has been mailed by speed post with acknowledgement due tothe AT. This communication has been served on AT, but there was no response. This essentiallyturns on whether lessee was not inclined to receive the award and whether the AT was constrainedto lodge the award in the arbitration centre which would become a mini trial of sorts. Owing topeculiar facts and circumstances of this case and more particularly, owing to the trajectory thismatter has taken in pre-numbering https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 stage quaOP, this Court considers that in this case breach of Section 31(5) of A and C Act plea does not aid thepetitioner. There can be no two ways about Hon'ble Supreme Court in Tecco Trichy Engineers case,[Union of India Vs. Tecco Trichy Engineers and Contractors reported in (2005) 4 SCC 239] and ArkBuilders Private Limited case [State of Maharashtra and Others Vs. Ark Builders Private Limitedreported in (2011) 4 SCC 616] having held that delivering signed copy of an arbitral award is not amere procedural formality, but is a matter of immense significance as it becomes a starting point forlimitation. In this case, owing to predecessor Hon'ble Judge having summoned records of AT,examining this position and having come to the conclusion that the captioned OP presented on30.09.2019 is within time, the lone impediment to lessee owing to not being delivered with a signedcopy of impugned award stands removed and therefore, this aspect of the matter can be given aquietus dehors delving into whether lessee was reluctant to receive and AT was constrained to lodgein the arbitration centre.20. It is made clear that this will not serve as a precedent for all and every case of infarct of Section31(5) of A and C Act, as it is on the peculiar facts and more particularly, the trajectory the matter hastaken in pre- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 numbering stage wherein thelone impediment qua lessee flowing from Section 31(5) of A and C Act infarct stood removed.Hon'ble Predecessor Judge's pre-numbering stage proceedings are dated 24.10.2019 and04.11.2019.S.Rajeswari vs Mr.L.Ramesh on 21 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22694584/821. In the light of the narrative thus far, captioned OP fails and the same is dismissed. Consequently,connected application is closed. There shall be no order as to costs.21.01.2021 Speaking/Non-speaking order Index : Yes / No Internet : Yes / No mkhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ O.P.No.35 of 2021 M.SUNDAR.
