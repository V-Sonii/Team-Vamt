The first respondent and his brothers were entered into a rental agreement in respect ofshop in Door No.213, Big Bazaar Street, Trichirappalli, with one Muthiah Nadar husband of the firstaccused/second respondent for five years from 09.06.1994 to 08.06.1999. Thereafter, the firstrespondent/complainant and his brothers were entered into another agreement with one Lakshmi,wife of Muthiah Nadar in respect of shops in Door Nos.214 and 215 of ground floor for a period offive years from 23.10.1996 to 22.10.2001.

The first accused's husbandsub-let the shop No.213 to his wife, namely Lakshmi. In that regard, the first respondent filedR.C.O.P before the Rent Controller/III Additional District Munsif, Tiruchirappalli, relating to shopNo.213 as R.C.O.P.No.219 of 2001 as against the first accused's husband and in relation to shopNos.214 and 215, he has filed another R.C.O.P.No.193 of 2001 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisCrl.R.C(MD)No.875 of 2021 against the said Lakshmi-A.1 In order to ascertain the statement in thecounter-affidavit of Muthaiah Nadar that he has sub-let in respect of shop No.213 to his wifeLakshmi, the son of the complainant has filed an application under the Right to Information Act on12.07.2014 before the Commercial Tax Officer of the Gandhi Market Circle regarding TINNo.33903380968 of M/s.Aruna Metals. As per the information, dated 18.08.2014, it discloses thatthe above Tin was issued to Lakshmi-A.1 for the shop in Door No.213 on 12.01.1997. He also filedanother application under the Right to Information Act on 02.01.2015, for which, by reply dated22.01.2015, replied with regard to shop Nos.214 and 215 that since the dealer objected to givedocuments to the Information Officer, as the Rent Control Original Petition is pending and the samewas informed to the son of the first respondent that it could not be given. As against the said reply,an appeal filed before the Tamil Nadu Information Commission. The State Information Commissiondirected the third respondent herein to furnish information. Thereafter, the son of the defactocomplainant was given reply, dated 12.11.2015. Further alleged that by reply dated 07.12.2016, oneof the Right to Information Petition, dated 07.11.2016, was denied on the ground that there was stayin W.P.No.37685 of 2015. Thereafter, the second respondent filed appeal before the Tamilhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C(MD)No.875 of 2021 Nadu Information Commission and itwas ordered to furnish the information. In order to comply with the order, dated 26.07.2018, byreply dated 28.08.2018, the petitioner herein had furnished a rental agreement dated 01.01.1997 forshop Nos.213, 214 and 215. On receipt of the said agreement, dated 01.01.1997, the first respondentalleged that the said agreement is a forged one and that apart, from the rental agreement, dated23.10.1996 executed between the second respondent and the landlords, there was no rentalagreement executed separately by the first respondent in favour of the first accused. Therefore, thefirst respondent lodged complaint before the Inspector of Police and also the Commissioner ofPolice, Trichirappalli. Since they did not take any action, the first respondent filed a complaintseeking direction under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.3. By an order, dated 07.08.2021, the learned Judicial Magistrate No.1, Tiruchirappalli inCr.M.P.No.4345 of 2021, directed the fifth respondent to register the F.I.R as against A.1 to A.3 andinvestigate the case and file the final report.4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the learned Magistratemechanically without application of mind https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C(MD)No.875 of2021 directed the fifth respondent to register the F.I.R as against the officials, who furnishedinformation under the Right to Information Act. The information furnished under the Right toInformation Act cannot be termed as offence, since the petitioner had only discharged her officialduty being a Government official and it cannot be termed as crime punishable under the IndianPenal Code. The officials are being dragged into the private litigation of the second respondent asscapegoats which in turn leading to wastage of working hours in performing their duty.C.Kayalvizhi vs R.Sugumar on 23 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166757267/35. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent submitted that right orwrong, the learned Magistrate directed the fifth respondent to register a case against the petitioner.When the petitioner is being an accused, she has no say before registering the F.I.R and she has nolocus to challenge the order passed by the learned Magistrate. In support of his contention, he reliedupon the Judgment reported in 2014 (4) SCC 626 Dinubhai Boghabhai Solanki Vs. State of Gujaratand others, in which, the Honourable Supreme Court of India held that it would not be necessary togive an opportunity of hearing to the proposed accused as a matter of course. The Court cautionedthat if prior notice and an opportunity of hearing have to be given in everyhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C(MD)No.875 of 2021 criminal case before taking any actionagainst the accused person, it would frustrate the entire objection of an effective investigation.6. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the fifth respondent submitted that asdirected by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Tiruchirappalli in Cr.M.P.No.4345 of 2021, dated07.08.2021, the fifth respondent registered the F.I.R in Crime No.1341 of 2021 on 15.11.2021 for theoffences under Sections 465, 468, 747 and 420 of I.P.C as against the first accused alone, namely,the second respondent herein. After registration of F.I.R, the investigation is pending. The thirdrespondent herein filed quash petition in Crl.O.P(MD)No.18514 of 2021, in which, this Courtgranted interim stay of further proceedings of the order in Cr.M.P.No.4345 of 2021, dated07.08.2021 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.1, Tiruchirappalli and it is pending.7. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the learned Senior Counsel appearing forthe first respondent, the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent, the learned counselappearing for the third respondent and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for thefifth respondent and perused the entire materials available on record.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C(MD)No.875 of 20218. On a perusal of the records revealed that though the learned Judicial Magistrate No.1,Tiruchirappalli, directed the fifth respondent to register the case as against the respondents 2 and 3and the petitioner herein, the fifth respondent registered the case only as against the secondrespondent herein, since the third respondent and the petitioner are Government officials, whofurnished details under the Right to Information Act. Whatever the documents furnished by thesecond respondent herein, the same was furnished to the first respondent's son. That apart, Section23 of the Right to Information Act says that no Court shall entertain any suit, application or otherproceeding in respect of any order made under this Act and no such order shall be called in questionotherwise than by way of an appeal under this Act. It does not appear to interdict proceedings beforethe civil Courts alone. The bar against entertaining any suit, application or other proceeding inrespect of any order made under the Act, places a total embargo on any judicial proceeding againstany order made under the Act except by way of an appeal as provided under Section 19 of the Act.Thus, the information furnished by the Public Information Officer in response to a request made toher under Section 7 of the Act can be treated as an 'order'. Section 19 of the Act providing for appealshttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C(MD)No.875 of 2021 uses the expressions decision andorder as forming the subject matter of appeals. Those replies are immune to challenge either beforethe civil Court or before the criminal Court except by way of an appeal under Section 19 of the Rightto Information Act.C.Kayalvizhi vs R.Sugumar on 23 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166757267/49. In view of the above, the prosecution against the officials, who furnished the information underthe Right to Information Act, is misconceived. Therefore, the fifth respondent rightly registered theF.I.R only as against the second respondent herein and the investigation is pending. Accordingly,this Criminal Revision Case is disposed of.                                                                                 23.02.2022                     Index             : Yes                     Internet          : Yes/No                     ps                     Note :                     In view of the present lock                     down owing to COVID-19                     pandemic, a web copy of                     the order may be utilized                     for official purposes, but,                     ensuring that the copy of                     the order that is presented                     is the correct copy, shall                     be the responsibility of the                     advocate       /     litigant                     concerned.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                                                             G.K.ILANTHIRAIYAN, J.                                                                                        ps                     To                     1.The Judicial Magistrate No.1,                       Tiruchirappalli.                     2.The Inspector of Police,                       Fort Crime Police,                       Tiruchirappalli.                     3.The Record Keeper,                       Vernacular Section,C.Kayalvizhi vs R.Sugumar on 23 February, 2022Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166757267/5                       Madurai Bench of Madras High Court,                       Madurai.
