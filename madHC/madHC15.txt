The parties are referred to as per their rank before the trial Court. http://www.judis.nic.inS.A.(MD)No.622 of 19963.The brief facts, leading to file this Second Appeal, are as follows:- It is the case of the plaintiff thatthe suit property shown as L1, L2, L7, L8 and F1 and G is in possession and enjoyment of theplaintiff and the second defendant. Originally the suit property and the north eastern side propertywas owned by one Subramania Pillai and he has mortgaged the said properties to one,Paripooranam Chettiar, who is the father of the plaintiffs, in the year 1951 under Ex.A1, dated09.11.1951. Thereafter, the mortgaged properties were sold to the mortgagee, ParipooranamChettiar, through sale deed Ex.A2 dated 22.05.1958. Though the sale deed indicated that the entiremortgaged properties were sold to the plaintiffs' father, Paripooranam Chettiar, however, the suitproperty was not included in the sale deed due to oversight. Since the dispute arose between themthe said Paripooranam Chettiar filed O.S.No.49 of 1963 for declaration. In the above suit, acompromise decree was passed wherein the suit properties was declared in favour of the father ofthe plaintiffs. Eversince, the date of death of the father of the plaintiffs, his legalheirs had controlover the properties and the suit property was in possession of the plaintiff and the seconddefendant. The alleged sale of the suit property in favour of the first defendant is not correct andO.S.No. 510 of 1970 was also filed against the defendant and his predecessors in title,http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 wherein declaration and injunction was granted infavour of the plaintiffs' father. Hence the suit.4. The first defendant denying the allegations in the plaint stated that the suit properties viz., L1, L2,L7, L8, F1 and G were originally owned by one Subramania Pillai and he has sold the same to thefirst defendant on 18.09.1961. Eversince the date of sale, the first defendant is in possession andcultivated the said portion shown as G, F1 and put up a latrine in L2 and has also perfected title byadverse possession. The said Paripooranam Chettiar has never enjoyed the suit property. The saledeed in favour of the plaintiffs' father did not convey the suit property. Earlier suit in O.S.No.510 of1970 was not barred as res judicata and Paripooranam Chettiar was never in possession of the suitproperty. Therefore the legal heirs are also not entitled for possession of the suit property. Hence heP.Chidambaram vs Chelliah @ Sandhiveeran ... on 25 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73214349/2disputed the plaintiffs' claim.5. On the side of the plaintiff, P.W.1 and P.W.2 were examined and Exs.A1 to A9 were marked. Onthe side of the defendants, the second defendant was examined as and Exs.B1 to B5 were marked.http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 19966. Based on the above pleadings, the trial Court has framed as many as 11 issues and afterconsidering the entire documents, particularly previous judgments, granted the decree forpermanent injunction in favour of the plaintiffs. The first Appellate Court reversed the findings ofthe trial Court only on the ground that the compromise decree in O.S.No.49 of 1963 was notregistered. Aggrieved against the said findings that the plaintiffs did not derive any title, the presentsecond appeal is filed.7. While admitting the Second Appeal, the following substantial questions of law have been framed:-a) Whether the first Appellate Court was correct in reversing the judgment and decree of the trialcourt in the face of the compromise decree in O.S.No.49/63 and O.S.No.510/70 marked as Exs.A3and A4? andb) Whether the suit filed by the plaintiff is barred by the principle of res judicata?8. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently contended that the first AppellateCourt has simply allowed the appeal by dismissing the suit only on the ground that the compromisedecree requires registration as the same has not been registered, the plaintiffs are not entitled to thesuit properties. It is the http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 further contention thatoriginally the property owned by one Subramania Pillai and he has mortgaged the same to theParipooranam Chettiar, who is the father of the plaintiffs under Ex.A1. Thereafter, he has sold thesuit property on 22.05.1958. However, in the above documents due to over sight, the second item(suit property) shown in the mortgage deed was not shown in the schedule of property. However thefact remains that the plaintiffs were in possession of the entire property. Though the mother of thefirst defendant claims to have purchased the the suit property from the said Subramania Pillai in theyear 1963 under Ex.B1 and the suit in O.S.No.49 of 1963 was filed in the year 1963 by the father ofthe plaintiffs against the mother of the first defendant. In the above suit, the first defendant and hisfather and mother were party defendants. In the above suit, a compromise decree was passed andthe suit property more fully mentioned in the plaint was declared in favour of the father of theplaintiffs. O.S.No.510 of 1970 is also filed and wherein, the first defendant herein has admitted thetitle of the plaintiffs in respect of the suit property. The above suit is also reached finality and theappeal also dismissed and possession has been confirmed. Hence, it is the contention that the trialCourt has analysed the entire evidence whereas the first Appellate Court is non suited the appellantonly on the ground that the previous judgments not registered, now the plaintiffs cannot claim anytitle on the basis of the sale deed of the year 1961(Ex.B1).http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996P.Chidambaram vs Chelliah @ Sandhiveeran ... on 25 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73214349/39. Whereas the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents 6, 8 to 12 submitted that sinceEx.A2 did not cover the second item of the mortgaged property, title did not pass to the plaintiffs'predecessors. Though the title has been declared under the compromise decree in favour of theplaintiffs in respect of the suit property, the compromise decree was not registered. Therefore, thesame cannot be relied upon for any other properties, for which he made reliance upon the judgmentof the Hon'ble Apex Court in 1996 (1) MLJ 38, Bhoop Singh vs. Ram Singh Major and others.Therefore, the contention that the compromise decree without registration would not convey thetitle to the plaintiffs. Therefore, prayed for dismissal of the appeal.10. In the present case, the identity of the properties is not in dispute and also the fact that the suitproperty and other properties originally owned by one Subramania Pillai is not disputed by bothsides. Similarly, the mortgage deed- Ex.A1, which was registered in favour of the said ParipooranamChettiar, who is the father of the plaintiffs is also not disputed. On careful perusal of Ex.A2-saledeed reveals that though the mortgaged properties were sold, the second item of the mortgageproperties (ie., the suit property) shown in Ex.A1 is not found place http://www.judis.nic.inS.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 in Ex.A2-sale deed. The entire recitals of the sale deed indicates that thesale was only in respect of the mortgaged properties shown under Ex.A1 for a total saleconsideration of Rs.3000/- and the mortgaged money of Rs.2000/- has adjusted.11. It is the contention of the defendants that under Ex.B1 dated 18.09.1961 the suit property, ie.,second item of Ex.A1-mortgage deed, was sold to the first defendant's mother. Therefore, they havederived title to the properties. It is also relevant to note that based on Ex.A3, a suit in O.S.No.49 of1963 was filed by the father of the plaintiffs against the defendants and their parents. In Ex.A3 acompromise decree was arrived between the parties and in the above compromise decree, it isrecorded as follows:...in pursuance of the said compromise arrived at between the parties, the order ofdecree that the plot marked as L, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L7, L8, F1 and G in theCommissioner's first plan attached to this decree belongs to the plaintiffs in absoluterights.and the above decree has reached finality has not been put in challenge.12. From the above compromise decree among the first defendant and his parents, who werearrayed as defendant Nos.1 to 3 and the vendor, Subramania Pillai was also made as fourthdefendant and in respect of the suit properties, the http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996declaration was given in respect of the plaintiffs' father. It is also relevant to note that Ex.A4, a suitin O.S.No.510 of 1970 has filed, which is also not in dispute. In the above suit, permanent injunctionwas also granted in favour of the plaintiffs' father. Exs.A4 and A5 was also filed and proved theabove fact. The above suit has also reached finality and the appeal filed against the said suit was alsodismissed which could be seen from Exs.A6, A8 and A9. The copy of the order and judgment inCMA.No.17/1994 are carefully perused.P.Chidambaram vs Chelliah @ Sandhiveeran ... on 25 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73214349/413. In O.S.No.510 of 1970, the defendants and their predecessors, in fact, admitted the title of theplaintiffs' father in the written statement and in the above suit, the title of the plaintiffs to thepresent suit property was also admitted by them. The trial Court has also considered that thedefendants have also not produced any documents to show that the title of the property stands intheir name. Except the kist receipt for the Patta number for the year 1998 to 1992, no otherdocuments has filed to show that they are in possession of the property. The property is admittedlyvacant land and title has been admitted. Though they produced the sale deed under Ex.B1, thecategorical stand of the defendants in the previous suit in O.S.No.49 of 1963, they infact admittedthe title and in C.M.A.No.17/1994, the possession has been confirmed in favour of the plaintiffs'father.http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 199614. The pleadings and previous judgments make it very clear that despite the purchase in the year1961 under Ex.B1, the title did not go to them, in view of the compromise decree. It is also to benoted that in Ex.A2-sale deed, though the suit property was not found in the schedule, the recitals ofthe sale deed indicate that the entire properties mortgaged under Ex.A1 were sold. Merely becausethe second schedule was omitted, it cannot be said that title did not pass to him. The first defendantand their parents admitted the title of the plaintiffs in respect of the suit properties in previous suit.When the defendants were already parties to the suit in respect of the same properties and issueswere framed in O.S.No.510 of 1970 and it reached the finality. Now they cannot set up title based onthe earlier document in the year 1961, namely Ex.B1. The issue was already decided substantiallyand directly with regard to the suit property and reached finality. Such findings definitely operatesas res judicata and the defendants are infact barred from claiming any right over the suit property.Further, the compromise deed also declared the title in favour of the plaintiffs' father in respect ofthe suit properties.15. Much reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 1991(1) MLJ 38-Bhoop Singh case (supra). In the http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996above case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if the compromise decree is bonafide, in thesense that the compromise is not a device to obviate payment of stamp duty and frustrate the lawrelating to registration, would not require registration. In a converse situation, it would requireregistration. Further, it is held that the compromise decree were to create for the first time the right,title or interest in immovable property of the value of Rs.100/- or upwards in favour of the any partyto the suit, the decree or order would require registration. It is the contention of the learned SeniorCounsel that even the compromise decree is valid, the first time right has been created under thecompromise decree in respect of the suit property. Therefore, the same is required registration.16. It is relevant to note that Section 17 Sub-section (2) (vi) of the Registration Act, 1908, reads asfollows:17. D o c u m e nts of which r e g i st r a t i o n is c o m p u l s o r y : (1) Th e foll o win g d o cu m e ntss h all b e re gi ster e d , if the pr o p erty to w hi ch they relate is situate in a di stri ct in w hi ch , andif they h ave b e e n e x e c ute d o n o r afte r the d ate o n w hi ch , A ct N o.

The above Section makes it clear that any decree or order of the Court made a compromise withrespect of the suit properties, the same does not require any registration.18. In the judgment, reported in 2020 (10) SCC 250 (Gurcharan Singh case supra) wherein it hasbeen held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the compromise decree arising out of immovable propertywhich is the subject matter of the suit or proceedings in question does not require any registration.In the above judgment the Hon'ble Apex Court has also distinguished Bhoop Singh case (supra). Therelevant paragraphs are as follows:17. It would, therefore, be the duty of the court to examine in each case whether theparties have pre-existing right to the immovable property, or whether under theorder or decree of the court one party having right, title or interest therein agreed orsuffered to extinguish the same http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 andcreated right, title or interest in praesenti in immovable property of the value of Rs100 or upwards in favour of other party for the first time, either by compromise orpretended consent. If latter be the position, the document is compulsorily registrable.19) ...7. A compromise decree passed by a Court would ordinarily be covered by Section17(1)(b) but subsection(2) of Section 17 provides for an exception for any decree orP.Chidambaram vs Chelliah @ Sandhiveeran ... on 25 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73214349/6order of a Court except a decree or order expressed to be made on a compromise andcomprising immovable property other than that which is the subject-matter of thesuit or proceeding. Thus, by virtue of sub-                          section(2)(vi) of Section 17 any decree or                          order      of         a        Court       does           not        require                          registration.              In       sub-clause(vi)               of     sub-                          section (2), one category is excepted from                          sub-clause(vi),                i.e.,      a     decree          or     order                          expressed       to        be    made      on    a    compromise         andcomprising immovable property other than that which is the subject-matter of thesuit or proceeding. Thus, by conjointly reading Section 17(1)(b) and Section 17(2)(vi),it is clear that a compromise decree comprising immovable property other thanwhich is the subject matter of the suit or proceeding requires registration, althoughany decree or order of a Court is exempted from registration by virtue of Section17(2)(vi).http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 A copy of the decree passed in Suit No.250-A of1984 has been brought on record as Annexure P-2, which indicates that decree dated 04.10.1985was passed by the Court for the property, which was subject matter of the suit. Thus, theexclusionary clause in Section 17(2)(vi) is not applicable and the compromise decree dated04.10.1985 was not required to be registered on plain reading of Section 17(2)(vi)....19. Similarly in the case of Som Dev and Others Vs. Rati Ram and Another, (2006) 10 SCC 788 inparagraph No.13, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:13. This Court in Som Dev and Others Vs. Rati Ram and Another, (2006) 10 SCC 788while explaining Section 17(2)(vi) and Section 17(1)(b) and (c) held that all decree and orders of the Court including compromise decreesubject to the exception as referred that the properties that are outside the subjectmatter of the suit do not require registration. In paragraph 18, this Court laid downthe following:-'18....But with respect,it must be pointed out that a decree or order of a court does notrequire registration if it is not based on a compromise on the ground that clauses (b)and (c) http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 of Section 17 of theRegistration Act are attracted. Even a decree on a compromise does not requireregistration if it does not take in property that is not the subject-matter of the suit..'21). In the above case, the earlier decree, which was sought to be ignored on theground that it was not registered related only with the suit property.P.Chidambaram vs Chelliah @ Sandhiveeran ... on 25 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73214349/7This Court held that the said decree did not require registration. Following reasonswere given in paragraph 14:-16. In facts of the present case, the decree dated 04.10.1985 was with regard toproperty, which was subject matter of the suit, hence not covered by exclusionaryclause of Section 17(2)(vi) and present case is covered by the main exception craftedin Section 17(2)(vi), i.e., any decree or order of a Court. When registration of aninstrument as required by Section 17(1)(b) is specifically excluded by Section 17(2)(vi)by providing that nothing in clause (b) and (c) of sub- section (1) applies to anydecree or order of the Court, we are of the view that the compromise decree dated04.10.1985 did not require registration and learned Civil Judge as well as the HighCourt erred in holding otherwise. We, thus, set aside the order of the Civil Judgedated 07.01.2015 as well as the judgment of the High Court dated 13.02.2017. Thecompromise decree dated 04.10.1985 is directed to be exhibited by the trial court.The appeal is allowed accordingly. http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 199620. The Hon'ble Apex Court, in the judgment reported in 2020 (10) SCC 250(Gurucharan Singh and others v. Angrez Kaur and another) after considering thejudgment in Bhoop Singh case (supra) has held that when legislature has specificallyexcluded applicability of clause (b) and (c) with regard to any decree or order of aCourt, applicability of Section 17(1)(b) cannot be imported in Section 17(2)(v) byindirect method. Therefore this Court is of the view that suit property was the subjectmatter of the compromise decree and it was the subject matter of earlier suit andhence, the same does not require any registration.21. Having regard to the above judgments and the compromise decree, further, there is no disputewith regard to the identity of the properties. The possession of the defendants also not established.The plaintiffs' title in view of the previous proceedings has to be protected and once the title wasestablished in favour of the plaintiffs as the suit property is the vacant land, the possession followstitle. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that the plaintiffs are certainly entitled to the decree andjudgment passed by the trial Court. The Substantial Questions of Law are answered in favour of theplaintiffs. http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.(MD)No.622 of 1996 http://www.judis.nic.inS.A.(MD)No.622 of 199622. In the result, the Second Appeal stands allowed. The judgment and decree, dated 18.06.2011,made in A.S.No.5 of 1996 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Sivaganga, is set aside and thedecree and judgment, dated 31.10.1995, made in O.S.No.493 of 1993 passed by the learned DistrictMunsif, Sathankulam, is confirmed.
