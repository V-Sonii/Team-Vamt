1. Service Law – Assistant Public Prosecutors – Transport (Subordinate) Prosecution Service Rules, 1979 (Uttar Pradesh) – State Public Services Tribunal – Respondent was working as a Cashier in the Transport Department – While in service, for some alleged misconduct, departmental inquiry was initiated against him and was later dismissed from service – the respondent during the pendency of litigation attained the age of superannuation – persons who were junior to him were promoted/appointed as Assistant Public Prosecutors – Once his position has been restored after order of dismissal being set aside, he too is entitled for promotion from the date his juniors were promoted as Assistant Public Prosecutors – the grievance of the respondent is not sustainable for the reason that the recruitment to the post of Assistant Public Prosecutor shall be made by direct recruitment on the basis of a competitive examination followed by a Viva Voce test to be conducted by the Commission – This fact has been completely ignored by the Tribunal and so also by the High Court in the order impugned. *Ajay Rastogi; Abhay S.

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 – Section 166 – Income of the Deceased – In absence of salary certificate the minimum wage notification can be a yardstick but at the same time cannot be an absolute one to fix the income of the deceased. In absence of documentary evidence on record some amount of guesswork is required to be done. But at the same time the guesswork for assessing the income of the deceased should not be totally detached from reality. Merely because claimants were unable to produce documentary evidence to show the monthly income, same does not justify adoption of lowest tier of minimum wage while computing the income. There is no reason to discard the oral evidence of the wife of the deceased who has deposed that the was earning around Rs.15000/­ per month. *R. Subhash Reddy; Hrishikesh Roy, JJ.

Anticipatory Bail – Absconder – While granting bail, especially anticipatory bail which is per se extraordinary in nature, the possibility of the accused to influence prosecution witnesses, threatening the family members of the deceased, fleeing from justice or creating other impediments in the fair investigation, ought not to be overlooked. Even if there was any procedural irregularity in declaring the Accused as an absconder, that by itself was not a justifiable ground to grant pre­arrest bail in a case of grave offence. The conduct of the Accused in absconding for more than two years without any justifiable reason should have weighed in mind while granting any discretionary relief. N.V.

Electricity Act 2003 – Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) – Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) acted within the scope of its power of regulatory supervision in directing the Appellant to make payment of LPS within the time stipulated in the order of MERC. The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) rightly upheld the direction. In any case, such a direction cannot be interfered with in exercise of powers under Section 125 of the Electricity Act which corresponds to the power of Second Appeal under Section 100 of the CPC, since the sine qua non for entertaining an appeal is the existence of a substantial question of law. *Indira Banerjee, V.

His only ground for challenge was that he had to be selected since he was ‘more meritorious’ as he had better qualifying marks.

If that be the position, the terms of LOI is clear that the said payment is towards the lease rentals and is the upfront payment which becomes a part of the lease transaction and therefore not refundable only if the lease agreement comes into operation and not otherwise. The word employed is not “forfeiture”, therefore, the amount payable towards the advance lease rentals and the other advance payments provided in clause 2 of the LOI, cannot be forfeited if there is default in complying with the term and entering into the lease agreement, going by the stipulations contained in the LOI governing the parties herein.

Such a conduct would include a silence emanating from a party who is expected to speak and express.

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – Section 19 – Application for setting aside decree, award or order – Whether in an appeal/application filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Section 19 of the MSME Act, 2006, the appellate court would have any discretion to deviate from deposit of 75% of the awarded amount as a pre-deposit ? Held, The requirement of deposit of 75% of the amount in terms of the award as a pre-deposit is mandatory. However, at the same time, considering the hardship which may be projected before the appellate court and if the appellate court is satisfied that there shall be undue hardship caused to the appellant/applicant to deposit 75% of the awarded amount as a predeposit at a time, the court may allow the pre-deposit to be made in instalments. *M.R. Shah, A.S. Bopanna; JJ. Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority v. M/s Aska Equipments Ltd., C.A. No. 6252 of 2021 08-10-2021 https://pdf.caselaw.in/sc/2021/10/325/49. Limitation – Second Appeal – Application seeking condonation of delay – The High Court, while dismissing the application seeking condonation of delay in filing second appeal observed that sufficient cause for delay has not been established. The litigant, who is contesting the matter, cannot be negligent and it would be unfair to deprive the respondent, litigating for the last 17 years, of the valuable right that has accrued to him. A second appeal lies to the High Court if the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved. the High Court erred in dismissing the second appeal solely on the ground of limitation. Therefore, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set­aside. Indira Banerjee, J.K. Maheshwari; JJ. Dr. Yashwantrao Bhaskarrao Deshmukh v. Raghunath Kisan Saindane, C.A.
