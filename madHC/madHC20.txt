First, we take up for consideration question No.4.                                   8. Mrs.V.Pushpa, learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing for                     the appellant/Revenue has contended that the Tribunal committed an                     error in holding that the provisions of Section 14A of the Act read withThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/3                     8D of the Income Tax Rules (for short, the Rules) would have no                     applicability if there was no exempt income received though the                     disallowance was linked to expenditure incurred on investment fetching                     exempt income. The argument of the learned Junior Standing Counsel                     is that the Tribunal ought to have appreciated that the disallowance                     under Section 14A of the Act did not depend upon the exempted                     4/31https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/                     income as Section 14A of the Act and Rule 8D of the Rules never link                     the disallownace with the exempted income earned.                                   9. She has referred to the concession agreement dated                     22.12.2000 entered into between the State of Tamil Nadu and the                     respondent/assessee in order to focus before this Court as to the                     nature of work undertaken by the assessee. Therefore, it is submitted                     that the issue has not been correctly decided by the Tribunal. In fact,                     in the case of CIT Vs. M/s.Tamilnadu Industrial Development                     Corporation Limited [T.C.A.No.509 and 510 of 2018], the issue                     pertaining to disallowance under Section 14A of the Act was considered                     by a Division Bench of this Court, to which, one of us (TSSJ) was a                     party, and by a common judgment dated 07.7.2020, the appeals                     filed by the Revenue were allowed.                                   10. Rather, we had an occasion to consider a similar issue in the                     assessee's own case in TCA. No.485 of 2020 dated 05.1.2021, the                     relevant portions of which read thus :                                              8. We need not labour much to decide                                        the substantial question of law framed, asThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/4                                        identical issue was considered in the case ofCommissioner of Income Tax, Chennai vs                                        M/s.Celebrity Fashion Ltd. in T.C.A.No.26 of                                        2018 dated 21.09.2020.

We had an occasion to consider a                                   similar question in the case of CIT, Corporate                                   Circle-3,        Chennai     Vs.

In the said                                   appeal, question of law No.5, which was                                   framed for consideration, was as to whether                                   the Tribunal was right in holding that the                                   provisions of Section 14A of the Act read with                                   Rule 8D of the said Rules will have no                                   applicability if there is no exempt income                                   earned or received during the previous year                                   though       the       disallowance     is     linked    to                                   expenditure incurred on investment fetching                                   exempt income. The said case was decided in                                   favour      of   the    assessee      and    against    the                                   Revenue and in doing so, we have followed the                                   decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this                                   Court in the case of CIT Vs. Chettinad Logistics                                   Pvt. Ltd. [reported in (2017) 80 Taxmann.com                                   221]. This decision would come to the aid and                                   assistance of the assessee.                                         ........https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201828. In fact, an identical argument was raised for consideration before the Hon'ble Division Bench ofthis Court in the case of Chettinad Logistics Pvt. Ltd., and such a contention was rejected byrendering the following findings:13. Mr.Senthil Kumar, seeks to distinguish the judgment in Redington (India) Ltd. case (supra)based on the fact that Rule 8D had not kicked-in by AY 2007-08, which was the AY being consideredin the said case.The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/514. According to us, this was not the argument, put forth, before the Division Bench. As a matter offact, the Revenue relied heavily on Rule 8D.14.1 Mr.Ravikumar, who appeared for the Revenue, in that matter and who is present in this Court,informs us that he had in fact argued that the Rule was clarifactory in nature and would applyretrospectively, and that, the Division Bench, therefore, discussed the impact of Rule 8D of theRules.15. However, it is, our view, as indicated above, independent of the reasoning given in Redington(India) Ltd. case (supra) that Rule 8D cannot be read in a manner, which takes it beyond the scopeand content of the main provision, which is, Section 14 A of the Act.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 15.1 Therefore, as adverted to above,Rule 8D, cannot come to the rescue of the Revenue.15.2 In any event, the Tribunal, via, the impugned judgment has remitted the matter to theAssessing Officer.                                               15.3    Therefore,     for   the     foregoing                                        reasons,      we   are   of   the   view,    that   no                                        interference is called for qua the impugned                                        judgment.                                              As against the decision of this Court inthe case of Chettinad Logistics Pvt. Ltd., the Revenue preferred appeals before the Hon'ble SupremeCourt and the special leave petitions were dismissed on the ground of delay as well as merits in thedecision reported in (2018) 95 Taxmann.com 250."9. Thus, by applying the above decision, this Tax Case Appeal is allowed and the substantialquestion of law is answered in favour of the appellant/assessee.11. We do not find any justifiable reason to take a different view and the legal position in theassessee's own case wholly covers the said question. Further, the decision in the case ofM/s.Tamilnadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited does not render assistance to the caseof the Revenue. Accordingly, substantial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of2018 question of law No.4 is answered against the Revenue.12. Next, we take up for consideration the issue pertaining to the claim for depreciation on theroads, which have been developed and maintained by the assessee pursuant to the agreemententered into with the State Government.13. The assessee is a joint venture company formed by the Tamil Nadu Industrial DevelopmentCorporation Limited and the Tidel Park for creation of infrastructural facility such as road systems,highways, bridge system by bringing private resources in the development of the said projects. Theassessee was granted right to implement the East Coast Road project. The assessee, while filing theThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/6return of income for the relevant assessment years, claimed depreciation at the rate of 15% onimprovement to the IT Carridor (Road) considering the roads as 'plant and machinery'.14. The Assessing Officer did not accept the said claim, but allowed depreciation at the rate of 10%considering the roads to be a 'building' in terms of the definition contained in the Notes to NewAppendix I in the Income Tax Rules, 1962.15. Aggrieved by the same, the assessee preferred appeals before the Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals)-11, Chennai-34 [for brevity, the CIT(A)] by contending that the depreciation should behttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 granted at the rate of 15% bytreating road as 'plant and machinery' for the assessment years 2007-08 to 2010-11. For theassessment year 2013-14, the assessee claimed depreciation at 25% by treating investment in road asan intangible property. The CIT(A) partly allowed the appeals and directed the Assessing Officer toallow depreciation at 10% on the road by treating it as a 'building'. The claim made by the assesseefor grant of depreciation at 25% by treating investment in road as an intangible property wasrejected.16. The Revenue carried the matter by way of appeals before the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal, bythe impugned common order, rejected the appeals and in doing so, followed its earlier decisiondated 24.10.2008 in the assessee's own case for the assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05respectively made in ITA.Nos.2082/Mds/2008 and 817/Mds/2007. In paragraph 6 of the impugnedcommon order, the said decision of the Tribunal has been referred to.17. The learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing for the appellant/Revenue has contended thatthe said decision of the Tribunal has not been accepted by the Revenue and an appeal has been filedbefore this Court against the same. In fact, such a submission was made before the Tribunal, whenthe Tribunal heard the present appeals. However, there was no material produced by the Revenuehttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 before the Tribunal to show that thecommon order dated 24.10.2008 passed for the earlier assessment years namely 2003-04 and2004-05 has been reversed or modified by this Court. Therefore, the Tribunal chose to follow itsearlier decision.18. Hence, before us, the learned Junior Standing Counsel submits that she will make hersubmissions on merits and this Court may take a decision notwithstanding the fact that the Revenuehas not accepted the decision of the Tribunal dated 24.10.2008 in the assessee's own case for theearlier assessment years namely 2003-04 and 2004-05. Based on the said submission, we haveheard the matter on merits.19. The learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing for the appellant Revenue has pitched her caseby placing strong reliance on the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of North KarnatakaExpressway Ltd. Vs. CIT [reported in (2014) 51 Taxmann.com 214]. It is submitted by the learnedJunior Standing Counsel that when the assessee was engaged in the business of infrastructuraldevelopment in execution of agreement with the National Highways Authority or as in the presentcase, with the State Government and had constructed a road on Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT)The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/7basis on the land owned by the Government, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to225 of 2018 assessee could not claim depreciation on the toll road so constructed and operated bytreating it as a building under Section 32 of the Act.20. The learned Junior Standing Counsel has also placed reliance on the decision of the High Courtof Delhi in the case of Moradabad Toll Road Co. Ltd. Vs. ACIT [reported in (2014) 52 Taxmann. com21] to support the proposition that toll road would not qualify as a plant so as to entitle the assesseea higher rate of depreciation.21. In the instant case, the assessee has not challenged the decision of the CIT(A) or that of theTribunal granting depreciation at the rate of 10%. Therefore, we are not required to decide as towhether the assessee is entitled to a higher rate of depreciation. What is required to be decided inthe instant case is as to whether the CIT(A) and the Tribunal were right in holding that thedevelopment done by the assessee by forming the road would qualify as a plant so as to be entitledto depreciation under Section 32 of the Act.22. On a careful perusal of the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of North KarnatakaExpressway Ltd., and more particularly the finding rendered in paragraph 47 of the said judgment,it is clear that the Court has pointed out that they were not concerned in the said case with theownership of a building or a land beneath which was not conveyed and sold or transferred byexecution of a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 conveyance or a saledeed. It was further pointed out that depending upon the facts and circumstances in each case, theclaim of ownership could be made, that it was not that in every case the principles referred to by theHon'ble Supreme Court would apply and that depending on the nature of the claim, the context andthe circumstances, in which, it arose, these principles would have to be invoked and applied. It wasalso pointed out that there was no general rule, which could be said to be laid down. Ultimately, inthe said decision, the Court held that the assessee definitely invested in the project of constructiondevelopment and maintenance of the National Highway and such of the assets in the form ofbuilding and plant and machinery etc., and that the claim for depreciation could be validly raisedand granted.23. In fact, the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of North Karnataka Expressway Ltd.,would lend support to the case of the assessee as argued by the assessee before the Assessing Officerby claiming it as plant and machinery. However, since the assessee is not on appeal against the saidfinding, we are of the view that the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of NorthKarnataka Expressway Ltd., does not advance the case of the Revenue before us.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201824. On this issue, it would be beneficial to refer to the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in thecase of PCIT Vs. GVK Jaipur Expressway Ltd. [reported in (2018) 100 Taxmann.com 95]. Thisdecision was rendered by the Court on 10.10.2017, which was much after the decision of the BombayHigh Court in the case of North Karnataka Expressway Ltd., which was rendered on 14.10.2014.The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/825. In the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in the case of GVK Jaipur Expressway Ltd., theCourt has taken into consideration all the decisions and more particularly the decisions of the(i) Delhi High Court in the case of Moradabad Toll Road Co. Ltd.;(ii) Allahabad High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Noida Toll Bridge Co. Ltd.[reported in (2013) 30 Taxmann.com 207];(iii) Madras High Court in the case of CIT Vs. VGP Housing (P) Ltd [reported in (2016) 66Taxmann.com 354];(iv) Rajasthan High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Jawahar Kala Kendra [reported in (2014) 43Taxmann.com 159]; and(v) Rajasthan High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Mohd. Bux Shokat Ali [reportedhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 in (2001) 118 Taxman 712], and itwas held that while considering the issue as to whether the national highway was a road or not, onehad to go by the common parlance of road where public at large had an access. As in the case onhand, the assessee therein was granted licence for construction, against which, they had a right touse and collect licence fee to use the land, that in that view of the matter, they had a right to restrictthe people without non payment of toll tax and that if the definition, which was given under the Actwas looked into, even a development made while occupying the premises and development of a roadwas the main agreement between the parties and that therefore, the argument of the Revenue that itwould not qualify for depreciation was not sustainable. Accordingly, the view taken by the Tribunalwas confirmed.26. The special leave petition filed by the Revenue against the decision of the Rajasthan High Courtin the case of GVK Jaipur Expressway Ltd., was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court asreported in (2018) 100 Taxmann.com 96.27. So far as decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of North Karnataka Expressway Ltd. isconcerned, the said decision was followed in the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case ofCIT-10 Vs. West Gujarat Expressway Ltd. [reported in (2017) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 82 Taxmann.com 224] and the appeal filed by the Revenue was allowedagainst which, the assessee preferred an appeal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which has beenentertained, leave granted and tagged with other appeals, which are pending as reported in (2016)73 Taxmann.com 150 (SC).28. In the light of the above legal position, we are of the considered view that the reasons assignedby the Tribunal in dismissing the appeals filed by the Revenue call for no interference. Accordingly,substantial question of law No.1 is also answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assesseeand it is held that the assessee is entitled for depreciation at the rate of 10%.The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/929. Substantial question of law Nos.2 and 3 are identical and virtually one and the same,questioning the correctness of the decision of the Tribunal in holding that the assessee is eligible fordepreciation under Section 32(1)(ii) of the Act on the lease hold rights obtained by the assessee for aperiod of 99 years pursuant to an agreement entered into between themselves and the SIPCOT.30. To be noted, neither the Assessing Officer nor the Tribunal had gone into the terms andconditions of the lease agreement. This issue arises for consideration only for the assessment years2007-08 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 and 2008-09. In respect ofthe other assessment years, which are subject matter of consideration in these batch of appeals, viz.,2009- 10, 2010-11, 2012-13 and 2013-14, the assessee had been granted a relief.31. The issue would be as to whether the Tribunal was right in confirming the order passed by theCommissioner of Income Tax-III, Chennai dated 18.11.2013, granting the benefit of depreciation forthe assessment year 2009-10 on the lease hold right obtained by the assessee from the SIPCOT.32. The assessment for the years 2007-08 and 2008-09 was reopened by issuance of notice. One ofthe reasons for reopening the assessment was on the claim for depreciation amounting toRs.19,29,341/- on the lease hold right of Rs.77,17,365/- for the assessment year 2007-08 and theclaim for depreciation amounting to Rs.14,47,006/- on the lease hold rights of Rs.57,88,024/- forthe assessment year 2008-09.33. In the proposal to reopen, the Assessing Officer stated that a plain reading of Section 32 of theAct showed that to claim depreciation, the assessee must have owned, wholly or partly, the assetsand should have used the same for the purpose of business of the assessee to be eligible fordepreciation. The assessee was called https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of2018 upon to explain. By a common reply dated 25.6.2014, the assessee stated that they entered intoan agreement with the SIPCOT, IT Park, Siruseri, over a land measuring 4.90 acres for a period of99 years and such an agreement was executed on 21.9.2005 and registered as Doc. No.6285 of 2005on the file of Sub Registrar, Tiruporur. The assessee reproduced one of the covenants contained inthe said agreement, viz., covenant No.8.34. The Assessing Officer, after referring to the reply given by the assessee, extracted the saidcovenant and opined that the assessee, by his own admission, stated that the land in question was alease land taken from the SIPCOT, that the assessee did not own the asset in question and thattherefore, they failed to clear the qualifying benchmark for being eligible for depreciation.Accordingly, the claim for depreciation was rejected and the return of income was added back to theincome of the assessee.35. The assessee filed appeal before the CIT(A) stating that the assessee claimed depreciation at therate of 25% on lease hold rights of land leased (20 years) by the SIPCOT. The assessee referred toSection 32 of the Act and submitted that it provided that the assessee should have owned, wholly orpartly, the assets and should have used the assets for the purpose of business to be eligible to claimhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 depreciation under the Act, whichwas rejected by the Assessing Officer without taking note of the fact that the assessee became theThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/10eligible owner of the lease hold land and would be entitled to claim depreciation. Further, theassessee contended that they paid Rs.20,15,000/- per acre for 4.90 acres and acquired the leasehold rights, which essentially qualified the assessee for an allowable revenue expenditure over aperiod of time as enumerated under law. Therefore, the assessee further contended that theconclusion arrived at by the Assessing Officer that the assessee was not the owner of the asset andnot eligible for depreciation, was incorrect.36. Further, the assessee stated that except the right of alienation of the said asset, the assessee wasconferred with all rights of enjoyment in respect of the lease property and therefore, they would beentitled to claim depreciation. The assessee placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble SupremeCourt in the case of Madras Industrial Investment Corporation Ltd. Vs. CIT [reported in (1997) 225ITR 802] wherein it was held that the total amount of lease premium paid in respect of suchagreements should be amortized over the period of lease and only the amount pertaining to therelevant previous year should be allowed as deduction. Further, the assessee relied on the decisionsof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018case of Empire Jute Co. Ltd. Vs. CIT [reported in (1980) 124 ITR 1] and in the case of CIT Vs.Associated Cement Co. Ltd., [reported in (1988) 172 ITR 257] wherein it was held that theexpenditure, which did not fall in the capital field, should be allowed as revenue expenditure.37. Further, the assessee submitted that the assessee, on acquiring the land on lease for a period of99 years, making payment of advance rent to the tune of Rs.48 Crores and paying a sum of Rs.40lakhs per month as monthly rent, the advance lease rent paid by the assessee was allowable asrevenue expenditure. To support such contention, the assessee placed reliance on the decision of theSpecial Bench of the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of JCIT Vs. Mukund Ltd. [reported in (2007) 291ITR (AT) 249]. Thus, the assessee pleaded before the CIT(A) that considering the nature of businessof the assessee, it was essential to allow the expenditure incurred for operational purposes asrevenue expenditure in the computation of total income. The assessee pointed out that the AssessingOfficer neither allowed depreciation on the lease hold rights nor treated the same as revenueexpenditure and in doing so, violated the principles of natural justice.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201838. The CIT(A) took note of the submissions, but did not examine the nature of transaction betweenthe assessee and the SIPCOT and more particularly, the terms and conditions contained in theagreement dated 21.9.2005. In fact, even the Assessing Officer did not go into the full contents of theagreement dated 21.9.2005, but appears to have been guided only by the reply given by the assesseedated 25.6.2014 in response to the notice issued under Section 148 of the Act wherein the assesseeextracted Clause 8 of the agreement dated 21.9.2005.39. In our considered view, there should have been a deeper examination of the conditionscontained in the agreement to arrive at a correct conclusion with regard to the nature of transactionbetween the assessee and the SIPCOT.The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/1140. The CIT(A) referred to Section 32(1)(ii) of the Act and observed that in terms of the saidprovision, depreciation was allowable for any other business or commercial right of similar naturebeing intangible asset acquired on or after 01.4.1998. Further, the CIT(A) referred to Rule 5 of theRules and Part-B of the Depreciation Table wherein the depreciation on intangible assets wasallowable at 25%. The CIT(A) referred to the submission of the assessee that the right to develop theproperty as per the agreement was an intangible https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to225 of 2018 asset and therefore, the assessee was eligible for depreciation at 25%. The CIT(A) statedthat the assessee relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and following the saiddecisions, held that the assessee was entitled to depreciation on the lease hold right at 25%.41. Aggrieved by the same, the Revenue was on appeal before the Tribunal contending that theCIT(A) erred in allowing the assessee's claim for depreciation on the ground that the lease hold landwas an intangible asset without considering the fact that the lease hold right was not an intangibleasset. In this regard, reliance was placed on the decision of the Bangalore Tribunal in the case ofCyber Park Development & Construction Ltd. Vs. DCIT, Circle 11/(2), Bangalore [reported in (2016)71 taxmann.com 210].42. The Tribunal noted the submissions of the Revenue by placing reliance on the decision of theBangalore Tribunal in the case of Cyber Park Development & Construction Ltd., and held thattransferring an immovable property by way of lease created an interest in the land, as has been heldin Cyber Park Development & Construction Ltd., and taking note of the definition of 'capital asset',as defined under Section 2(14) of the Act, the property need not be owned by the assessee, it washeld that the definition 'capital asset' could not be given restrictive meaning.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201843. The Tribunal referred to the decision of this Court in the case of A.R.Krishnamurthy andA.R.Rajagopalan Vs. CIT [reported in (1982) 133 ITR 922], the decision of the Calcutta High Courtin the case of in A.Gasper Vs. CIT [reported in (1979) 117 ITR 581] and the decision of the Hon'bleSupreme Court in the case of R.K. Palshikar (HUF) Vs. CIT [reported in (1988) 172 ITR 311] andheld that transfer by way of lease was to be treated as a transfer of capital asset, as the lease createdan interest in the land and therefore, to that extent, it extinguished the right of the transferor.44. With regard to the assessee's case, the Tribunal held that when the assessee transferred his leasehold rights in the land in his occupation by way of lease to another person, it amounted toextinguishing his rights in the property and since his lease hold rights had created an interest in theland, i.e. an enjoyment and possession, it would fall within the definition of 'capital asset' as definedunder Section 2(14) of the Act. Thus, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that transfer of leasewould amount to a transfer of capital asset and hence, the assessee was eligible to claim depreciationon the asset, which was transferred to them by way of a lease deed. On the said ground, the appealfiled by the Revenue was dismissed. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201845. As pointed out earlier, the factual aspect has not been analysed by the Assessing Officer thoughthe assessment was primarily reopened for the reason to consider the correctness of the claim fordepreciation on the lease hold right enjoyed by the assessee. Unfortunately, the Assessing OfficerThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/12was solely guided by the reply given by the assessee dated 25.6.2014, in which, they have extractedcondition No.8 of the agreement dated 21.9.2005. On a plain reading of the said condition, at thefirst blush, one gets an impression that the assessee was also a beneficiary of a common facility,which the SIPCOT was obliged to provide all entrepreneurs, who have been allotted sites/units inthe IT Park.46. Even before us, the copy of the agreement dated 21.9.2005, styled as a lease deed has not beenplaced for consideration. The CIT(A) did not examine the obligations, which were to be fulfilled bythe assessee under the lease agreement. In fact, in the strict sense, terming it as a lease agreementitself may be a misnomer because, such agreement is bound to contain various conditions, which theassessee had to fulfil.47. After hearing Mr.A.S.Sriraman, learned counsel appearing for the assessee, we come to knowthat the land, on which, the facility has been developed by the assessee, is owned by the SIPCOT andit https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 appears that the developmentconsists of providing roads inside the IT Park, establishment of a multi-level car parking, etc. Underthe said agreement, the assessee had to develop these facilities and maintain them and the period isstated to be 99 years, which is virtually perpetual. Therefore, a deeper examination of the factualissue would have given a quietus to the matter even at the level of the Assessing Officer.48. Before the Tribunal, the argument appears to have been whether the lease hold right wouldqualify as a 'capital asset' as defined under Section 2(14) of the Act. In our considered view, suchissue would not arise for consideration in the facts of the present case because what was required tobe examined was the type of transaction between the assessee and the SIPCOT.49. Interestingly, the assessee, in their appeal petition before the CIT(A), made an alternate prayerwhile they would state that their claim for depreciation on lease hold right was allowable andalternatively they would state that it was essential to allow the expenditure incurred for operationalpurposes as revenue expenditure. Their argument was that the Assessing Officer could not havedenied both the reliefs.https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 201850. One more interesting fact is that such depreciation has been allowed on the lease hold land forthe assessment years 2009-10, 2010-11, 2012-13 and 2013-14. It is not clear as to whether in thoseyears, there was any detailed consideration with regard to the factual aspect, which is now beingagitated before us.51. In our considered view, the decision in the case of Cyber Park Development & Construction Ltd.,was couched on a different set of facts and would not be of assistance to the case of the Revenue.52. Ms.V.Pushpa, learned Junior Standing Counsel for the Revenue would place reliance on thedecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mother Hospital (P.) Ltd., vs. CIT, Trichur [reported in(2017) 79 Taxmann.com 375]. In the said decision, it has been held that in terms of Explanation 1 toThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/13Section 32(1) of the Act, it is only when the assessee holds a lease right or other right of occupancyand any capital expenditure is incurred by it on construction or renovation or improvement ofbuilding, the assessee would be entitled to depreciation to the extent of such expenditure incurred.It is the submission of the learned Junior Standing Counsel that this decision will fully support theargument of the Revenue.53. On the contrary, Mr.A.S.Sriraman, learned counsel for the assessee would submit that thedecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of2018 in the case of Mother Hospital (P.) Ltd., would support the case of the assessee and in thisregard, referred to paragraph 10 of the judgment wherein it has been stated that from the plainlanguage of Explanation 1 to Section 32(1) of the Act, it was clear that when the assessee held a leaseright or other right of occupancy and any capital expenditure was incurred by the assessee on theconstruction of any structure or doing of any work in or in relation to and by way of renovation orextension or improvement to the building and the expenditure on construction was incurred by theassessee, then the assessee would be entitled to depreciation to the extent of any such expenditureincurred.54. In our considered view, these decisions cannot be straight away applied to the cases on handwithout taking note of the factual position, which, as already been pointed out, was not done by theAssessing Officer or the CIT(A) or for that matter, the Tribunal. In fact, the assessee has to bepartially blamed for not submitting an effective reply to the notice issued under Section 148 of theAct.55. Further, we find that the decision of this Court in the case of A.R.Krishnamurthy andA.R.Rajagopalan was in respect of a lease- cum-licence granted by the State Government forconducting mining activities in favour of the assessee company and it appears to be anhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 exclusive right and the question wasas to whether such a transaction would amount to transferring a capital asset and thereby attractingcapital gains. This being not the case of the assessee, this decision is wholly inapplicable.56. The decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of A.Gasper was in respect of right conferredon a statutory tenant and the question was when the right got extinguished on account of a sublease,would it amount to extinguishment of the rights in a capital asset to attract capital gains. This beingnot the case of the assessee herein, this decision cannot be made applicable.57. Similarly, in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.K.Palshikar, thequestion, which arose, was as to whether the transaction effected by the assessee would amount totransferring a capital asset warranting capital gains tax.58. In our considered view, the Tribunal need not have taken the matter thus far to render a verdictin favour of the assessee especially when the Lower Authorities did not know the factual position.Thus, we are of the firm opinion that the matter has to be re-adjudicated by the Assessing Officer,for which purpose, the Assessing Officer has to threadbare analyse the agreement dated 21.9.2005entered into between the assessee and the SIPCOT and not go merely by theThe Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Tamilnadu Road Development on 19 January, 2021Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166582927/14https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to 225 of 2018 nomenclature or the title of thedocument. But, the Assessing Officer should examine the contents. It would also be well open to theassessee to raise the alternate plea, which they raised before the Assessing Officer stating that theexpenditure incurred for operational purposes ought to have been allowed as a revenue expenditure.59. For the above reasons, the finding rendered by the Tribunal, the CIT(A) and the AssessingOfficer with regard to the disallowance of depreciation on lease hold rights for the assessment years2007-08 and 2008-09 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Tribunal to take a freshdecision on merits and in accordance with law, after due opportunity to the assessee.60. In the result, the tax case appeals are partly allowed to the extent indicated hereinbelow:-(i) Substantial question of law No.1 is answered against the Revenue and in favour ofthe assessee and it is held that the assessee is entitled for depreciation at the rate of10%.(ii) Substantial question of law Nos.2 and 3 are left open, as the issue has been remanded to theAssessing Officer for a fresh consideration; and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ TCA.Nos.220 to225 of 2018(iii) Substantial question of law No.4 is answered against the Revenue following the decisionrendered by us in the assessee's own case in T.C.A.No.485 of 2020 dated 05.1.2021.
