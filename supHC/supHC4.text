The Supreme Court on August 18, 2021 in the case of Madhav v. State of Madhya Pradesh observed that the judicial conscience of the Court should be satisfied both about the recovery and about the origin of the human blood.From place of incidence blood stained soil and common soil was collected and was sealed in different – different packets was seized in presence of witnesses with seizure Memo.A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee & V. Ramasubramanian finds that apart from the fact that the witnesses in whose presence the seizure of the weapons was allegedly effected, had turned hostile, there is nothing on record to show that the blood stains said to have been present in those weapons, matched with the blood of the deceased.Unfortunately, the High Court proceeded on a wrong premise that there was scientific evidence to point to the guilt of the accused, merely because as per the FSL Report, the knife and lathis said to have been seized by the police, contained stains of human blood. The prosecution has not established either through the report of FSL or otherwise, that the blood stains contained in the knife and lathis were that of the deceased.The bench conscious of the fact that there is a divergence of views on this aspect.In Raghav Prapanna Tripathi vs. The State Of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1963 SC 74 a Constitution Bench by a majority held that,“…that it would be farfetched to conclude from the mere presence of bloodstained earth that that earth was stained with human blood and that the human blood was that of the victims…”.In Kansa Behera vs. State of Orissa, (1987) 3 SCC 480 Apex Court acquitted the accused on the ground that though the Serologist report found the shirt and dhoti recovered from the possession of the appellant to be stained with human blood, there is no evidence to connect the same with the blood of the deceased.In Surinder Singh vs. State of Punjab, (1989) Supp.(2) SCC 21 the blood stains found on the knife allegedly used for the commission of the offence, were established to be human blood. But Apex Court rejected the prosecution theory on the ground that those blood stains on the knife were not shown to be of the same group as the blood of the deceased.In Raghunath, Ramkishan & Ors. vs. State of Haryana, (2003) 1 SCC 398 the Supreme Court held that the blood stain, though of a human blood, is not conclusive evidence to show that it belongs to the blood group of the deceased.In Sattatiya vs. State of Maharashtra, (2008) 3 SCC 210 the Court found the credibility of the evidence relating to the recovery of the object used for the commission of the crime, substantially dented, on account of the fact that the blood stains, though found to be of human source, could not be linked with the blood of the deceased.In contrast, Supreme Court held in State of Rajasthan vs. Teja Ram and Others,  (1999) 3 SCC 507 that at times the Serologist may fail to deduct the origin of the blood, either because the stain is too insufficient or because of hematological changes and plasmatic coagulation.After referring to the Constitution Bench decision in Raghav Prapanna Tripathi, AIR 1963 SC 74 Supreme Court held in Teja Ram, (1999) 3 SCC 507 that it is not as though the circumstances arising from the recovery of the weapon would stand relegated to disutility, in all cases where there was failure of detecting the origin of the blood. The Court indicated in Teja Ram, (1999) 3 SCC 507 that,“…the effort of the Criminal Court should not be to prowl for imaginative doubts…” and that the doubts should be of reasonable dimension, which a judicially conscientious mind entertains with some objectivity.The decision Teja Ram, (1999) 3 SCC 507 was followed in Gura Singh vs. State of Rajasthan, (2001) 2 SCC 205 and in Prabhu Dayal vs. State of Rajasthan, (2018) 8 SCC 127.In R. Shaji vs. State of Kerala, (2013) 14 SCC 266 Supreme Court took note of almost all previous decisions starting from Prabhu Babaji Navle vs. State of Bombay, AIR 1956 SC 51 and including those in Raghav Prapanna Tripathi, AIR 1963 SC 74; Teja Ram, (1999) 3 SCC 507, Gura Singh, (2001) 2 SCC 205 ; John Pandian vs. State; (2010) 14 SCC 129 and Sunil Clifford Daniel vs. State of Punjab, (2012) 11 SCC 205 and came to the conclusion that once the recovery is made in pursuance of a disclosure statement made by the accused, the matching or nonmatching of blood groups loses significance.Therefore, as pointed out by Supreme Court in Balwan Singh vs. State of Chhattisgarh, (2019) 7 SCC 781 there cannot be any fixed formula that the prosecution has to prove, or need not prove that the blood groups match.
