Income Tax Act, 1961 – Section 43B Explanation 3C – Certain deductions to be only on actual payment – Explanation 3C is clarificatory – it explains Section 43B(d) as it originally stood and does not purport to add a new condition retrospectively.The object of Section 43B, as originally enacted, is to allow certain deductions only on actual payment. This is made clear by the nonobstante clause contained in the beginning of the provision, coupled with the deduction being allowed irrespective of the previous years in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee according to the method of accounting regularly employed by it. In short, a mercantile system of accounting cannot be looked at when a deduction is claimed under this Section, making it clear that incurring of liability cannot allow for a deduction, but only “actual payment”, as contrasted with incurring of a liability, can allow for a deduction. Explanation 3C, which was introduced for the “removal of doubts”, only made it clear that interest that remained unpaid and has been converted into a loan or borrowing shall not be deemed to have been actually paid.Whether the funding of the interest amount by way of a term ‘debenture’ amounts to actual payment as contemplated by Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ?The question in the present case is only whether interest can be said to have been actually paid by the mode of issuing debentures. Consequently, the impugned judgments of the High Court are set aside and the judgment and order of the ITAT is restored.
