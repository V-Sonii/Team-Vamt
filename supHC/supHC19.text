Registration Act, 1908 – there is no prohibition to register a document dealing with transfer of immovable property such as an apartment or a floor which is constructed in violation of the sanctioned plan or without a sanctioned plan.Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 contains such prohibition i.e. it prohibits the registration authority from registering any building or structure or part of the building without the production of sanctioned plan approved by the Municipality. There is inconsistency between the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 (Law falling within the Legislative field of Entry 6 of List III) and the provisions of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 (Law falling within the Legislative field of Entry 5 of List II) with regard to registration of such properties. In such cases Art.254 has no application since both legislations are not in List III (Concurrent List). Since overlapping is found between the law made by the State under List II on the one hand and a law referable to List III made by the then British Government in 1908 having all-India application ( it is thus a law akin to law made by Parliament under List III), the State law will be ultra vires because of the non obstante clause in Article 246(1) read with the opening words “subject to” in Article 246(3). In such a case, the State law, to the extent of inconsistency i.e Sec.178 (3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019, will fail. Similar logic applies to the Rule 26(h) of the common Building Rules framed vide G.O.Ms.No.168, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department dt.07.04.2012 which has been framed under the Greater Municipal Corporation Act, 1955 and the A.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 and the said Rule also will not prevail over the law made by Parliament in the field covered by List III. Similar logic applies to the Rule 26(h) of the common Building Rules framed vide G.O.Ms.No.168, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department dt.07.04.2012 which has been framed under the Greater Municipal Corporation Act, 1955 and the A.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 and the said Rule also will not prevail over the law made by Parliament in the field covered by List III. Therefore, Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 or Rule 26(h) of the Common Building Rules contained in G.O.Ms.No.168 M.A.U.D. Department dt.07.04.2012 cannot be quoted by the Commissioner of 1st respondent Municipal Corporation and he cannot instruct the 2nd respondent vide letter No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 asking him not to register unauthorized floors constructed or not under the Registration Act, 1908.Registration Act, 1908 – Section 22A – Prohibition of Registration of certain documents – Whether the Inspector General of Stamps and Registration can issue Memo prohibiting registration by Sub-Registrars of illegally constructed apartments / floors ?The Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, State of Telangana has no authority to issue Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 and the 2nd respondent erred in taking note of the same and refusing to register the document presented by the petitioner.(a) Whether the Commissioner of the 1st respondent Municipal Corporation can issue letter No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 to the 2nd respondent asking him not to register unauthorized floors constructed or not under the Registration Act, 1908?(b) Whether the Inspector General of Stamps and Registration can issue Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 prohibiting registration by Sub-Registrars of illegally constructed apartments/floors under the Registration Act, 1908.M.S. Ramachandra Rao; J.In this Writ Petition, the petitioner has challenged Lr.No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 sent by the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Nizampet to the Sub-Registrar, Quthbullapur,Ranga Reddy District (2nd respondent) directing the latter not toregister the alleged unauthorized floors which are constructed more than 2 floors as per the Annexure attached thereto within the limits of Nizampet Municipal Corporation (1st respondent) and the consequential action of the 2nd respondent in refusing to receive, register and release a sale deed presented by petitioner relating to floor No.302 in the third floor of ‘Pearl Heights’ with built up of 1090 sq.ft (including common areas and car parking), along with an undivided share of land admeasuring 24 sq. yds (out of 800 sq yds) constructed on plot Nos.116, 117, 132 and 133 in Sy.No.491/A of Bachupally village and Gram Panchayat, Bachupally Mandal, Medchal-Malkajgiri District.Case of the petitioner2. According to the petitioner, the vendor of the petitioner had applied for building permission from the then Bachupally Gram Panchayat for construction of Ground + 2 floors and such permission was accorded on 12.02.2019, and thereafter construction of residential apartments was commenced by petitioner’s vendor under the name and style ‘Pearls Heights’ and the same was completed and apartments were sold to respective vendees.3. Petitioner contended that on the assurance given by the then Gram Panchayat for regularization, petitioner’s vendor had constructed 3rd and 4th floors in addition to 1st and 2nd floor covered by the building permission.4. Thereafter the 1st respondent Municipal Corporation came into existence and all the records of the Bachupally Gram Panchayat stood transferred to the 1st respondent.5. Petitioner contended that when he presented the sale deed executed in his favour by his vendor before the 2nd respondent, the 2nd respondent refused to receive, register and release the same on the ground that the 1st respondent addressed a letter bearing No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 intimating the 2nd respondent not to register any unauthorized floors without production of sanctioned plan approved by it. It is also stated that 2nd respondent gave an additional reason that the subject property overlaps into Hafeezpet land which is subject matter of C.S.No.14 of 958.6. Petitioner contends that 2nd respondent is bound to receive the document presented before him for registration, scrutinize it and register it, if there are no legal impediments under Registration Act, 1908 for registration of the documents, that 1st respondent had no jurisdiction to issue any direction to the 2nd respondent asking him not receive any document presented for registration, and also the 2nd respondent, on the basis of the said letter, cannot refuse to register the same. It was also stated that the grounds taken by 2nd respondent for refusing to register the document are not covered by Section 22-A of the Registration Act, 1908 and the action of the 2nd respondent is illegal.7. Further, it is contended that the Registration Act, 1908 has not been amended pursuant to Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipality Act, 2019 and the 1st respondent cannot get any jurisdiction to issue such letters to the 2nd respondent.8. It is also contended that the State Government’s claim in respect of the land in Hafeezpet had been negatived by this Court in several cases and this Court had held that said lands are private lands; even other wise, the lands in Bachupally area like the subject land have no connection with Hafeezpet village or that any other lands covered by C.S.No.14 of 1958; and on a mere apprehension of overlapping of survey numbers, the 2nd respondent cannot treat the subject property as part and parcel of the land covered under C.S.No.14 of 1958.9. Petitioner has also placed on record Memo No.G2/257/19 dt.26.08.2020 of the Commissioner and Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, Telangana, Hyderabad quoting the provisions of Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 and prohibiting the registration of constructions made in violation of the sanctioned plan.10. Petitioner pointed out that even the Commissioner and Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, Telangana, Hyderabad cannot issue such direction without being empowered to do so under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908. Counter of the 1st respondent11. It is contended by the 1st respondent that the permission obtained by the vendor of the petitioner from the Bachupally Gram Panchayat on 12.02.2019 was only for Ground + 2 upper floors; but the vendor of the petitioner illegally constructed 3rd and 4th floors and the petitioner had purchased the flat in the 3rd floor illegally constructed by his vendor.12. The issuance of the letter No.56/TP/NMC/2019 dt.25.11.2019 by the 1st respondent to the 2nd respondent not to entertain any registration in respect of apartments constructed in illegally and unauthorisedly constructed floors is admitted and it is stated that rightly the 2nd respondent refused to register the document presented by the petitioner since it was an illegal construction.13. He stated that he was not aware whether the Sy.Nos. on which the subject flat was built was subject matter of C.S.No.14 of 1958.14. He stated that he is protecting the interest of the State Government and also protecting the environment by issuing the letter dt.25.11.2019 referred to above to the 2nd respondent. He stated that he is also taking steps to demolish the additional floors which are illegally constructed by the vendor of the petitioner in the subject complex.The stand of the 2nd respondent15. At the outset, the 2nd respondent denied the allegation of the petitioner that he declined to receive the document presented by the petitioner on the ground that the 1st respondent had raised an objection that the property is overlapping lands relating to C.S.No.14 of 1958.16. He stated that the 3rd respondent issued a Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 quoting the following provisions:17. It is stated that the Memo was issued by 3rd respondent exercising powers conferred under Section 69 of the Registration Act, 1908 to implement Section 22-A(1)(a) of the Registration Act, 1908. He stated that it is the duty of the Registrar to examine the provisions of the above Statute as on the date of registration of the document and protect interest of gullible public. He also referred to modified instructions dt.29.12.2020 relating to open plots/structures with which we are not concerned.18. Reference is also made to PIL No.210 of 2020 filed in this Court challenging the Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 and it is stated that relief claimed by the petitioner is also similar. Consideration by the Court19. Learned counsel for petitioner, learned Standing Counsel for 1st respondent and learned Government Pleader for 2nd respondent reiterated the stand of their respective clients.20. We have noted the contentions of all parties.21. It is no doubt true that the petitioner intends to register an apartment built on the 3rd floor of the complex ‘Pearl Heights’ constructed on plot Nos.116, 117, 132 and 133 in Sy.No.491/A of Bachupally village and Mandal, Medchal-Malkajgiri District.22. The vendor of the petitioner admittedly did not have permission from the Bachupally Gram Panchayat (the predecessor of the 1st respondent Corporation) to build 3rd floor of 4th floor in the subject property.Points for consideration23. The following points arise for consideration in this Writ Petition:(a) Whether the Commissioner of the 1st respondent Municipal Corporation can issue letter No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 to the 2nd respondent asking him not to register unauthorized floors constructed or not under the Registration Act, 1908?(b) Whether the Inspector General of Stamps and Registration can issue Memo No.G2/257/2019dt.26.08.2020 prohibiting registration by Sub-Registrars of illegally constructed apartments/floors under the Registration Act, 1908.Point (a)24. We shall first consider whether the Commissioner of the Nizampet Municipal Corporation (1st respondent) is empowered to issue the letter No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 directing the Sub-Registrar (2nd respondent) not to register unauthorized floors while exercising powers under the Registration Act, 1908.25. The Registration Act, 1908 was enacted to consolidate the law relating to the registration of documents. It specifies what are the documents which are compulsorily registerable and what are not compulsorily registerable in Section 17 and 18 thereof and prescribes the procedure to be followed for such registration in detail. Subject to payment of prescribed stamp duty and registration fee and other charges prescribed under the Act, a citizen is entitled to get his document dealing with transfer of immovable property registered by the Sub-Registrar, unless prohibited under the Act.26. Section 22-A of the Registration Act, 1908 deals with prohibition of registration of certain documents. It states:27. As per the above provision, the Commissioner of the Nizampet Municipal Corporation is not a person designated to prohibit registration of any documents relating to transfer of immovable property. There is no specific provision in the Registration Act, 1908 prohibiting registration of documents relating to transfer of immovable property which is illegally constructed. It is not the case of the respondents that any provision of Section 22-A is attracted entitling the 2nd respondent to refuse to register the document presented by the petitioner.28. Rule 58 of the Rules framed under the Registration Act, 1908 indicates what is the nature of enquiry to be conducted by a Registering Officer before he proceeds to register the document. It states:29. None of these contingencies mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of the above Rule 58 is attracted in the instant case. So, the main part of Rule 58 which prohibits him from going into validity of a document brought to him for registration, would have to apply. In the light of such prohibition, he is not entitled to refuse to register a document on grounds which are not prescribed by the Registration Act, 1908 for refusing to register a document.30. We may also point out that the Registration Act, 1908 was enacted in British India and had received the assent of the Governor General on 18.12.1908. It applies throughout India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Though it is enacted prior to coming into force of the Constitution of India, it is saved by Art.13(1) of the Constitution of India. It is a legislation referable to the Entry 6 of List- III (Concurrent List) in Schedule-VII to the Constitution of India which deals with “Transfer of property other than agricultural land; registration of deeds and documents.”31. Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 was enacted by the Telangana State Legislature in relation to the legislative field relatable to item 5 of List-II (State List) in the VII Schedule to the Constitution whish deals with “Local Government, that is to say, the constitution and powers of municipal corporations…”. It applies to both Municipalities and Municipal Corporations like the 1st respondent.32. Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 stipulates that the Registration Authority shall not register any building or structure or part of the building without the production of the sanctioned plan approved by the Municipality.33. Thus the State Legislature, while making a Law relating to the powers and constitution of the Municipal Corporations and Municipalities, made Section 178(3) dealing with the aspect of registration of documents relating to immoveable property and prohibited registration of certain documents relating to structures erected without/in violation of sanctioned plan.34. The question is whether Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 would prevail over the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908.35. This issue is dealt with by Articles 246 and Art.254 of the Constitution of India which state as under:36. Article 246 of the Constitution does not provide for the competence of Parliament or the State Legislatures as commonly perceived but merely provides for their respective fields. Article 246 only empowers Parliament to legislate on the entries mentioned in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule and that in case of a conflict between a State law and a parliamentary law under the entries mentioned in List III, the parliamentary law will prevail. (Security Association of India v. Union of India, (2014) 12 SCC 65)37. In Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 45 the Supreme Court explained the interplay between Lists I,II and III and the principles governing interpretation of Art.246 and Art.254 of the Constitution as under:38. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, 1985 Supp SCC 476, at page 573 the Supreme Court declared:39. While there is no prohibition contained in the Registration Act, 1908 to register a document dealing with transfer of immovable property such as an apartment or a floor which is constructed in violation of the sanctioned plan or without a sanctioned plan, Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 contains such prohibition i.e. it prohibits the registration authority from registering any building or structure or part of the building without the production of sanctioned plan approved by the Municipality.40. Thus there is inconsistency between the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 (Law falling within the Legislative field of Entry 6 of List III) and the provisions of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 (Law falling within the Legislative field of Entry 5 of List II) with regard to registration of such properties. In such cases Art.254 has no application since both legislations are not in List III (Concurrent List).41. Since overlapping is found between the law made by the State under List II on the one hand and a law referable to List III made by the then British Government in 1908 having all-India application ( it is thus a law akin to law made by Parliament under List III), the State law will be ultra vires because of the non obstante clause in Article 246(1) read with the opening words “subject to” in Article 246(3). In such a case, the State law, to the extent of inconsistency i.e Sec.178 (3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019, will fail.42. Similar logic applies to the Rule 26(h) of the common Building Rules framed vide G.O.Ms.No.168, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department dt.07.04.2012 which has been framed under the Greater Municipal Corporation Act, 1955 and the A.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 and the said Rule also will not prevail over the law made by Parliament in the field covered by List III.43. The State Legislature could have amended the Registration Act,1908 (since the said law is in the List III) and introduced a provision to prohibit registration of documents relating to transfer of immoveable property such as structures which are constructed illegally. But it has not done so.44. Therefore, we hold on Point (a) that Section 178(3) of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 or Rule 26(h) of the Common Building Rules contained in G.O.Ms.No.168 M.A.U.D. Department dt.07.04.2012 cannot be quoted by the Commissioner of 1st respondent Municipal Corporation and he cannot instruct the 2nd respondent vide letter No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 asking him not to register unauthorized floors constructed or not under the Registration Act, 1908. Point (a) is thus answered in favour of the petitioner.Point (b) :45. Now we shall consider Point (b) which is as under :(b) “Whether the Inspector General of Stamps and Registration can issue Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 prohibiting registration by Sub-Registrars of illegally constructed apartments/floors under the Registration Act, 1908?”46. In Sub-Registrar, Shamirpet vs. K. Ramakrishna Raju, Order dt.21.07.2004 in W.A.No.707 of 2002 (D.B.) a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court considered the question whether the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps has authority in law to issue any directions to the registering authority not to register any document. It observed that only the State Government has power to issue any notifications under Section 22-A of the Registration Act, 1908 not to register documents and Inspector General of Registration and Stamps has no such authority, and declared a Memo dt.22.03.1993 issued by the said authority as null and void and inoperative. The Bench declared that the Sub-Registrar is bound to receive documents and scrutinize the same and accordingly register the same if there are no other legal impediments for registration of the document and he cannot to refuse to register a document on the basis of a Memo issued by the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps.47. In view of the said binding precedent, we hold on Point (b) that the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, State of Telangana has no authority to issue Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 and the 2nd respondent erred in taking note of the same and refusing to register the document presented by the petitioner.48. As regards overlap with the land in Hafeezpet Village of the subject land in Bachupally Village, the respondents have denied the same and so it is not necessary to deal with the said aspect. Suffice it to point out that even assuming it to be so, Hafeezpet Village is subject matter of C.S.No.14 of 1958 on the file of this Court, a preliminary decree was passed therein on 28.06.1963; and the State Government challenged the said preliminary decree in O.S.A.(SR).No.3526 and 3527 of 2000, which was dismissed on 17.02.2001 and the said order was also confirmed in SLP.Nos.10622 and 10623 of 2001 on 16.07.2001. Therefore, it cannot be said that the State Government has any right, title or interest in the land in Hafeezpet Village.49. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is allowed; a Writ of Mandamus is issued declaring the action of 2nd respondent in refusing to receive, register and release the sale deed presented by petitioner in respect of Flat No.302, 3rd Floor, ‘Pearl Heights’, with a built up area of 1090 Sq.ft. (including common areas and car parking), along with an undivided share of land admeasuring 24 Sq.Yds. (Out of 800 Sq.Yds), constructed on Plot Nos.116, 117, 132 and 133 in Survey No.491/A, situated at Bachupally village and Gram Panchayat, Bachupally Mandal, Medchal-Malkajgiri District, on the grounds of (i) letter bearing No.45/TP/NMC/2019 dt.01.11.2019 issued by 1st respondent; and (ii) that the subject property is part and parcel of the lands covered under C.S.No.14 of 1958 as arbitrary, illegal, without any jurisdiction, contrary to the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 and in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India; and consequently a direction is issued to 2nd respondent herein to receive, register and release the sale deed presented by petitioner in respect of the above property without reference to letter bearing No.45/TP/NMC/2019, dt.01.11.2019, and Memo No.G2/257/2019 dt.26.08.2020 issued by the 3rd respondent, if document is in accordance with law, otherwise, within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.50. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is allowed as above. No order as to costs.51. Consequently, miscellaneous petitions, pending if any, shall stand closed.
